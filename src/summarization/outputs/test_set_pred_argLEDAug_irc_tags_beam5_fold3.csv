1994canlii4187.txt,"The petitioner sought a divorce and maintenance for herself and the couple's five-year old child. The wife was working and earned a modest income; the husband a substantial one. Allowing the application, that although the wife upgraded her education during the marriage with encouragement and financial support from the husband, she was entitled to maintenance for an indefinite period. The court reviewed the means and needs of the parties and awarded spousal in addition to child maintenance. The court recognized the indirect financial consequences to a custodial parent in raising children.","The wife sought a divorce, as well as maintenance for herself and the five-year-old daughter of the marriage. The parties had been married 10 years, and had been together for 10 years. The wife sought to have the Separation Agreement and Minutes of Settlement incorporated into a Corollary Relief Judgment so far as the jurisdiction of the court permits. The husband did not oppose the divorce, nor did he deny his responsibility to provide financial support for his daughter. The mother, who had accompanied the husband to various places in the Middle East and Brazil, did not take into consideration the amount of tax payable by the husband on the basis of her income. HELD: 1)The separation agreement was not in issue. 2)The petitioner was to bear the costs of the child's care. 3)The respondent was to pay the child support of $1,500 monthly for an indefinite period of time. 4)The mother's income was sufficient to attract the father's support. 5)The father would bear the net cost of child care which would attract the mother's net worth. 6)The support deadline should not be placed upon the wife when she has the direct responsibility of raising the child and when the availability of more gainful employment within the foreseeable future is uncertain."
1994canlii4796.txt,"The Applicant participated in a group retirement savings plan ('GRSP') created by Crown Life for its employees. The GRSP provided for an annuity income on retirement for each participating employee. To finance her contribution to the GRSP, she secured an interest-free loan from Crown Life and pledged her interest in the GRSP as security for the loan. Subsequent to leaving her employment with Crown Life, she refused to repay her loan and requested that her contributions to the GRSP be transferred to another carrier. When Crown Life refused, she applied under s.63 of the PPSA for an order declaring that Crown Life's security interest in the GRSP offended s. 146(2)(c.3) of the Income Tax Act which prohibits the taking of security in an RRSP in certain circumstances. She also sought orders requiring Crown Life to comply with her request to transfer her contributions and restraining Crown Life from realizing on its security. HELD: Application dismissed. 1)The terms of the GRSP and the security agreement in this case did not offend s.146(2)(c.3) of the Income Tax Act. 2)If the terms of the GRSP were breached by Crown Life, damages would be an adequate remedy. The Applicant's request for a restraining order was therefore refused. 3)Under the terms of the GRSP contract, Crown Life was not entitled to collapse the Plan. 4)No amount was due out of the Plan to the Applicant until she retired or made a proper request for a transfer. In this case her request for a transfer did not comply with the terms of the Plan. There was therefore nothing to which the security interest of Crown Life could attach until a proper request for a transfer was made or until the Applicant commenced her pension.","The applicant sought a declaration under s.63 of The Personal Property Security Act (PPSA) that her interest in a group registered retirement savings plan (later defined as the 'Group Plan') was not subject to a security interest she granted to Crown Life. She further sought an order restraining Crown Life from arbitrarily cancelling her participation in the Group Plan. HELD: 1)Section 146(2)(c.3) of the PPSA does not apply to the applicant. The taking of security interest by way of the loan agreement contravenes s. 146(3) and the Income Tax Act. 2)The applicant had not retired and there appeared to be no evidence of her having retired. The commutation and surrender provisions did not apply. 3)The application for a restraining order was denied. 4)The loan agreement contains no provision enabling Crown Life to collapse the applicant's account in the group plan and thereby create an attachable pension refund. If it did, such provision would violate s.146(12) and s.8.03 of the Act. 5)Since the applicant has not retired, there appears to be a no-monetary sum current for the Crown to set off, unless a proper request for a transfer has been made by the applicant by her.  5)The provisions of s.7.02 of the Plan Contract specifically provides that upon an annuitant's coverage terminating, the annuitants' account is to remain with the insurer and the proceeds of the account are to be used to purchase a qualifying annuity or transferred to a registered retirement income fund (RRIF) authorized by the government. 6)Section 7.02 provides that Crown Life is entitled to attach the resulting proceeds pursuant to the terms of the plan in the same manner as the secured party did in Phenix. 7)Since Ms. Corscadden has not been retired and no pension refund exists, there appear to be other arrangements in place to prevent the applicant from having her interest set off. Such arrangements must be realized in light of the provisions in s.57 of the Income tax Act and the personal property security act. 8)Each party was entitled to a share in the RRIF or any successor plan of their choice. 9)All contributions paid by the taxpayer to such institutions, together with interest and other returns earned thereon, are held by them as a deposit or in trust until the taxpayer reaches a qualifying age at which time the funds so held must be used either in a specified manner or transferred"
1994canlii5095.txt,"The Director of Labour Standards issued a certificate against the City of Regina certifying that it owed a transit employee $318.41 in wages for hours worked in weeks containing a statutory holiday in excess of 32 hours as provided in the Labour Standards Act. The City applied for a review. HELD: The City's application was allowed. Under the terms of the collective agreement in force, the employee was actually paid 4 hours pay in excess of the Act's requirements for each of the weeks in question. Pursuant to section 72 of the Act, therefore, these particular terms of the collective agreement applied since they were, when considered in light of the balance of the agreement, more favorable to the employee than the requirements of the Act.","The City applied to have the Director of the Labour Standards Branch of the Department of Labour issued a certificate pursuant to s. 60 of The Labour Standards Act declaring that the City owed its transit employee $511.08 in wages. The Director filed a letter reducing the assessment to $318.41 (including annual holiday pay). The City brought this application to review the validity of s. 10(1) and 6(2) of the Act which held that an employer is required to pay an employee at the rate of time and one-half for every hour worked in excess of 32 hours in any week containing a public holiday (HELD): the overtime arises only because there is a holiday in the week in question. No holiday means no issue. The City filed various documents, including copies of the collective bargaining agreement it has with the Amalgamated Transit Union, which covers Morgan's employment with the City, and asked me to compare the agreement's holiday pay with the Act's. HELD: The application was allowed and the certificate was amended to show that there were no wages due orowing to the employee on the day of the public holiday. There was no order as to costs."

Dismissing the appeal, that the Board had correctly interpreted its jurisdiction and made findings amply supported by the evidence arising from the de novo hearing. Failure of the police to lay a charge against the attacker did not disqualify the applicant from compensation if it was otherwise supported by the evidence.","The appellant appealed a decision of the Nova Scotia Utility and Review Board concerning an award of compensation pursuant to the Victims' Rights and Services Act.

1996canlii6881.txt,"FIAT. The parties were divorced in 1995 and all issues including spousal maintenance were left in abeyance. The petitioner had agreed to pay $3,000 per month which included child support but the support was reduced to $1,000 and was irregular and late. The two children were living with the petitioner and although old enough to hold jobs, had been unable to find employment. The petitioner's income exceeded $80,000 annually but he had been suspended with pay and the status of his employment was uncertain. HELD: 1)It was premature to fix the amount of spousal maintenance as asked for by the applicant. There were too many unknowns including the future of the petitioner's future job and income and how much the applicant would require should she go to university in the fall and what the children would do about future education. 2)The petitioner was not entitled to unilaterally reduce the maintenance. 3)The petitioner was directed to pay $1,500 plus $200.00 per month until the shortfall was paid in full.  4)The applicant was awarded costs of the application.","FIAT. The parties separated in the summer of 1994. All other issues raised in the divorce proceeding were left in abeyance including the issue of spousal maintenance. The petitioner had unilaterally reduced the monthly support from $3,000 to $1,500 for the months of September through December 1995. The husband was suspended with pay. HELD: 1)The application was premature. There were too many unknown factors surrounding the future situation of either party to conclude that what the applicant asks for is fair and reasonable. There was uncertainty of the husband's future job and income. Also, there was uncertainty as to what the wife would require if she did go to a university this fall. Finally, there were uncertain prospects for her future employment. 2)The petitioner was not entitled to unilaterally reduce the $1500.00 maintenance he consistently paid up to December 1995 to $2,000.00 without at least consulting with the husband. Had these payments continued the applicant would have recovered $6,000 at the rate at which she had been paid in 1994. 3)Since the husband had reduced his monthly support to $500.00 in September 1995 the wife had received only a total of $ 3,000 in April 1996. She had been paying $1 million in support since December 1995 but since then had been irregular and not on time. 4)Spousal support should have been increased by 1/3 of the 1/4 of a month in April and 1/5 of the month in June. 5)The court was of the opinion that the court was entitled to direct costs towards the application in any way it pleased or required them to be paid in direct way rather than in the usual way."
1997canlii787.txt,"After a sub-contractor failed to complete its contract work, the plaintiff, a supplier of materials to the sub-contractor sued the general contractor and the surety under the terms of a labour and Material Payment Bond for payment of a balance owing to it by the sub-contractor. The Bond contained a provision limiting the liability of the surety and the principal to make payment to any claimant not having a contract directly with the principal. Dismissing the action with costs, that there was no evidence of intention to contract, valuable consideration, or binding promise to pay between the general contractor and the supplier. With respect to the principal, as the Bond limits the liability of the surety and principal to make payment to a claimant such as the plaintiff not having a contract directly with the principal, liability is limited by the Bond to the amount which the principal would have been obliged to pay to the plaintiff if the provisions of the Mechanics' Lien Act applied to the work. As the contract was with the Crown, and the Act is not binding on the Crown, the general contractor was not obliged to pay anything to the plaintiff. Therefore, the supplier was not entitled to recover against the surety under the Bond.","After a sub-contractor failed to complete its contract work, a supplier of materials to the subcontractor sued the general contractor and the surety under the terms of a Labour and Material Payment Bond for payment of a balance owing to it by the sub contractor. The contract stipulated that if the Mechanics' Lien Act had applied, the contractor and surety would have been obliged to recover against it the money owing from the subcontractors. In the absence of a proper mechanics' lien Act, the supplier would not have been entitled to recover anything due to the third party statutory liens. HELD: 1)The claims of the plaintiff against the defendant and London Guarantee were dismissed. 2)The Mechanics'Lien Act does not expressly state that it binds the Crown. 3)The plaintiff was in a better position in that it seeks to recover under the Bond even though it would not be able to recover any amount from the defendant. There was no contract. The only authority cited with respect to the purpose and effect of Clause 4 (4) of the Bond is Johnson Controls Ltd. et al. (1996), 157 N.S.R. (2d) 350 (S.C.A.D.) which considered a provision of a Bond identical to that in Dias v. MacLean (1993), 10 C.L.R.(2d), 178 (N.S.)L.C.). 4)The defendant's claim against the plaintiff was dismissed as not having a cause of action against it. The plaintiff's claim for costs against the defendants based upon the limitation of liability set out in clause 4 was dismissed."
1999canlii12427.txt,The accused was charged with sexual assault and touching contrary to s.271(1) and 153 of the Criminal Code. The alleged offences occurred in the complainant's home when she was between the ages of 13 and 15. HELD: The accused was found not guilty on both counts. 1)There was insufficient confirmatory evidence for proof of guilt beyond a reasonable doubt. The evidence showed an escalating pattern of intrusive behaviour by the accused who admitted to touching her on two occasions and to have been on top of her once. His explanation that he fell on her was farfetched but the other explanations were not outlandish. None of the complainant's allegations involved alcohol nor was drunkenness alleged to be a factor. The evidence of the complainant's depression or withdrawal could have other explanations.,"The accused was charged with sexual assault and touching. The evidence of the complainant was that the accused often slept on the couch in the basement of the house adjacent to the room where the family watched TV. There was a couch or love seat in the living room adjacent to where the children often stayed up at least until midnight. The accused frequently came up to the complainant and touched her legs and breasts. She told her mother that he had touched her buttocks once while she was sleeping and then he fell on top of her and she threatened to leave and take her baby brother with him. HELD: The accused was found guilty. 1)The evidence tends to confirm the complainant's testimony. 2)The accused is not guilty of either of the offences described. He is not a person who would have done well in a house with a large number of cats or kittens. He would not be found guilty of any of the crimes committed. His behaviour is not dangerous. It is consistent with his pattern of intrusive behaviour. He has explanations for each incident. He was severely drunk and had been drunk. He did not have a job in the home. He worked outside the home cleaning up dog shit. There is no doubt that he is a sexual predator. The only evidence that he has is that he once tripped over his younger sister who was lying on the floor. However, there is also some circumstantial evidence surrounding his alleged acts of sexual assault. It would be unfair to him to have to justify his behaviour with respect to his children especially when the evidence of his repeated assaults on his own children corroborates his allegations. The lack of complaint would have been huge problems for the court as the child had moved into a new residence and the father was working from home. The father would not have been able to afford to move in with his new family and the child would be far more likely to be sexually assaulted than the accused himself. The mother's depression or withdrawal was also a factor. The absence of complaint by the complainant to her mother might have been a factor as well as his repeated acts of violence towards her children. The following evidence would have confirmed and confirmed the accused's evidence: 1)There was no evidence of physical or sexual assault on the part of the sexual predators. The complainant's evidence consisted of a series of isolated incidents. He touched her inappropriately, sometimes in the face or in the presence of his children. He brushed his hands over her face and body. He kissed her on the mouth and once while standing in front of the children"

She raised s.9 and 8 of the Charter in objecting to the arrest and seizure of the duffel bag. The voir dire occupied 5 days. HELD: 1)The four requirements set out in R. v. Feeney for a warrantless search were satisfied. The arrest was lawful. The search of the house and seizure of the duffel bag was incidental to the arrest and therefore lawful. 2)The accused had no expectation of privacy with respect to either her friend's residence or the bag. The decision in R. v. Edwards was squarely on point. There was no evidence tying the accused to the gym bag. It was of a different description than the one used in the drugstore robbery. The accused never asserted ownership of the bag or made any claim to any interest or right with respect to it. The gym bag constituted non-conscriptive evidence. 3)If there were any violations of the accused's Charter rights (and it was concluded there were not) they were of a minor nature and not sufficient to engage the provisions of s.24(2) of the Charter. To exclude the evidence would bring the administration of justice into disrepute.","The accused objected to her arrest and to the seizure of a duffel bag containing a quantity of narcotics. The police conducted a voir dire as result of opening of the trial. A great deal of evidence was presented, the majority of which was elicited in very detailed and extended cross-examination. The accused also called evidence on the voirs dire but did not testify. HELD: The arrest was lawful. The search of the house and seizure of the bag were incidental to the arrest and therefore lawful. Pursuant to s. 9 and 8 of the Charter the police need not demonstrate anything more than reasonable and probable grounds in order to establish a prima facie case for conviction. If there were any violations of the accused's rights under the Charter, the police would be entitled to search an arrested person for a weapon if under the circumstances it seemed reasonable to check whether the person might be armed.

Ace had been subpoenaed and had been sitting in the Court listening to other Crown witnesses. Defence counsel objected and claimed the Crown had not disclosed this witness. Ace was also a client of defence counsel and so defence counsel would not be able to cross-examine Ace. HELD: The Crown failed to provide proper disclosure to defence counsel, the non-disclosure had an adverse effect of the accused's ability to make full answer in defence and the appropriate remedy was to refuse to allow the Crown to call Ace as a witness.","The accused was charged with break and enters of homes and was denied involvement. After hearing evidence from the home owners, co-accused and peace officers who investigated the incidents, the Crown advised the court of its intention to call one Ace Carlos Whitecap to the witness box. Defence counsel objected on this basis, arguing that the Crown had ambushed him and his client and that they should not be permitted to do so. At the very least, another lawyer would have had to sit through the entire Crown case in order to be as effective as possible in the cross-examination of this witness. HELD: The accused's right to full answer and defence had been prejudiced only by not being told that Whitecap would be a Crown witness. 1) The defence met the test of the impunged non-disclosure having prejudiced or had an adverse effect on the accused's ability to make full answer/defence. 2) The Crown's failure to disclose its intent to call Whitecap as a witness has seriously damaged the accused’s right to effective representation. The Crown was not permitted to call this witness to give evidence in this trial. 3) The accused was not entitled to a stay of proceedings in the event the accused gave evidence against himself or his client. The defence should have been able to take the appropriate steps to protect the interests of both the accused and the witness. 4) There was no evidence that the accused was disadvantaged by the exclusion of Whitecap because he was a client of the Crown and, unknown to the prosecution, had been sitting in court listening to the other Crown witnesses. 5) The prejudice to the accused had not been caused by the absence of the defence witness. 6) The delay in proceedings was out of the question and requiring another lawyer to step in to cross-examine the witness would not be appropriate. The accused should have had ample time to consider the evidence and the case before election or plea. The only remedy is to refuse to allow the Crown to call that witness. The court found that a stay was not appropriate and any remedy that could be taken was the use of a stay court."

The mother and psychological father no longer lived together and for the past few months, the mother had been maintaining a clean and tidy apartment and attempting to improve her education and had taken parenting courses. The psychological father, with whom the mother had ended a tumultuous relationship, wanted the child returned to his care, stating that he planned on residing with the mother who would assist him in caring for the child.

The husband argued that he had entered into the separation agreement (which provided for joint custody of their young child, gave the wife all of the matrimonial assets with the exception of the husband's vehicle, and provided for spousal support in the amount of $600 per month for 15 years) only as an attempt to have the wife stay in the local area with the child. The wife had since moved with the child to New Brunswick where she was living with her parents and attending university; she was renting out the matrimonial home. Pursuant to the current court order, she was contributing the sum of $140 per month to the husband's access costs. Husband's current income set and child support awarded; the husband shall be responsible for 50 percent of the after tax child care costs; an additional $300 of spousal support ordered per month while the child remains in New Brunswick to address the access costs in the mother's budget; spousal support is reviewable in the event that these circumstances change, and at any rate, upon the completion of the mother's current degree; the mother shall not remove the child from the Province of New Brunswick to live in any other province without the father's consent. Although the court could not interfere with the agreement under s. 29 of the Matrimonial Property Act, the spousal and child support geared at keeping the wife in the local area and ensuring that her needs were addressed had all changed and a new arrangement was necessary to reflect the access costs among other issues. The wife had chosen to move away from child care services provided by the family that were practically free, as well as significant financial support and the ability to work in the furniture business with her father-in-law; she was not now pursuing a line of education which would build on her previous skills. Her educational expenses ought not be the basis for assessing spousal support and the duration of support set out in the separation agreement far exceeded what might be imposed by a court given the years they were together and their income disparity. The court reviewed the husband's history of income and expenses in setting his income for child support purposes.","The wife commenced divorce proceedings in November 2004.She sought custody, access, child support, spousal support and costs with a division of property in accordance with the Separation Agreement entered into between her and the husband in August 2004. The husband sought a variation of the provisions regarding child support and child support. It was his position that the particulars of the agreement did not and do not now reflect his net business income derived from self employment. He sought an increase in access. The mother argued the husband had failed to negotiate a mobility restriction clause which he assumed would protect his interests. HELD: 1) The Separation agreement was entered into to assure that his child would not be removed from his home town and that he was prepared to give her his equity in the home and possessions and guarantee her enough money per month to ensure she remained in the matrimonial home with his son. 2) The agreement clearly favours the mother. The father agreed to the terms of their agreement but did not ensure he was fully protected by overtly addressing mobility. There was no evidence of undue influence, fraud or evidence that would affect the ability to retain and instruct counsel. 3) The court ought not to interfere with the agreement between the parties. However, in light of the fact that there are significant changes in the circumstances of the parties, the court could not intervene. 4) The parties had entered into a separation agreement which purported to settle all matters between them and was to be incorporated into and form part of the Corollary Relief Judgement."
2006skqb382.txt,"The petitioner seeks child and spousal support. The parties signed a separation agreement and interspousal contract in July 2004. With respect to spousal support the agreement provides that it is the intention of the parties that spousal support will be based on a division of income until July 1, 2011.HELD: 1) The petitioner seeks a spousal support order in which the court is asked to impute income and then apply the provisions of their interspousal contract to determine quantum. The interspousal contract does not contemplate variation of the spousal support obligation in the event of a material change of circumstance. It will be for the trial judge to determine the intention of the parties when the agreement makes reference to the adjustments which 'will consider Technologies likely future earnings based upon whether Paul's contract is renewed with the Provincial Government'. This is not an appropriate case in which to make an order for interim spousal support. The petitioner is entitled to support under the agreement and in the circumstances as they presently exist. 2) With regard to child support, there is no question that Melanie remains a child of the marriage while she is attending her educational program. Insofar at the respondent's income is concerned, the gross income to the corporation is $65,000 per year. The respondent provided a pay stub for May 2006. It is not really a pay stub, but extrapolating from that statement the court concluded that the respondent's gross taxable income from the corporation as a result of the $65,000 contract is approximately $53,000. Child support will be ordered based on $53,000 on an interim basis.","The petitioner sought child support and spousal support pending trial. The parties signed a separation agreement in July 2004. The interspousal contract provided that the respondent was to pay one half of the net income to the petitioner by way of equal monthly payments. The agreement was incorporated into a consent order in December 2003. In April 2004 the respondent's employment was terminated. He received a severance package of $74,038. He claimed his only source of income was $490 per month from Canada Pension. HELD: 1)The agreement was binding. The petitioner was entitled to support under the agreement and the circumstances as they presently exist.  2)The petitioner was awarded $65,000 in interim child support. The amount payable shall be reduced in an amount equal to 40% of the petitioner's income. 3)The parties had signed a comprehensive agreement which dealt with parenting issues, child support, and the division of family property. Under the agreement, the respondent received lump sum, ongoing, and ongoing support of $1,000 per month. The actual amount of the expenses was somewhat more or somewhat less than the actual amount. 4)The court observed that this was not an appropriate case in which to make an order for interim support. While it is undisputed that the parties' relationship was long one (more than 25 years), the roles of the parties and the validity of their agreement is clearly disputed. If this Court was to award interim spousals support it would be hesitant to do so. The one half division of income shall continue up to and including June 30, 2007. Starting in the July 1, 2007 through to June 2008 the formula shall be that the petitioner shall be entitled to 40 per cent of net income based on the gross income of $125,000. 5)There were no circumstances in which it was necessary to apply Miglin as the Miglin analysis was not applicable.  6)Costs were left to the trial judge. 7)In this case, the petitioner had no means to pay back any interim support received. The court was cognizant of the costs."
2007skqb376.txt,"The respondent applies for an order varying the custody order by changing the primary residence from the petitioner to the respondent. HELD: 1) The present circumstances are remarkably similar to the circumstances in Bzowey v. Bzowey, 2005 SKQB 12. In both cases, the Court is asked to make the change based solely on the wishes of the child. There is even evidence from the custody and access report from 2005 that the children, or at least the older child, Jill, expressed similar sentiments about living with her mother. It cannot even be strenuously argued that the wishes of the child, Jill, have in fact changed. Those considerations were before the Court in the form of the custody and access report when the decision was made in 2005. 2) The Court should be loathe to make a variation order solely on the expressed wishes of a child of 11 or 12 years of age without some evidence as to why that current expression of interest has been stated. It may well be that the child truly does wish a change. It may also be that the child, as was referred to in the custody and access report, may be simply reflecting the views and therefore the pressures placed on the child by the non-custodial parent. 3) No evidence has been put forward about the negative impact of the continuation of the current order. There is no information before the Court to suggest that the current situation is no longer in the best interests of the children. No material change has been demonstrated. The application is dismissed.","In dealing with the first application, the petitioner sought to vary the child support order granted by the court in 2005 by changing the primary residence from the petitioner to the respondent. The respondent argued that there had been a clear declaration in two separate writings of the oldest child's desire to have primary residence change from her father to her mother. Further, there was some evidence that the younger child wished to also live with her mother or, at the least, live in the same residence as her older sister. HELD: The application was dismissed. 1)As no material change has been demonstrated, this application must be dismissed. 2)There is no principle of law that the wish of a child is absolute and in itself determines the issue of custody. Such an approach would ignore the statutory mandate to take into consideration only the best interests of the child. 3)The children were born, have grown up, and continue to live, go to school and have friends in Nipawin. There is no information before the court to suggest this is no longer in the best interest of these children. 4)The test for variation has been set out in cases such as Talbot v. Henry (1990), 151 Sask. R. 168 (Sask. Q.B.) Gerein J. succinctly states the current approach of the Court to the 'wishes of the children' issue. In each case, the court is asked to make the change based solely on the wishes of the Child. There was no conflict on the affidavits. A hearing was often ordered."
2009skqb36.txt,"FIAT: This is an application to determine interim parenting for the child, Kaira, who is 2.5 years old. There is conflicting information about the nature and extent of the petitioner father's parenting duties. The respondent has chosen to move to Victoria to attend school. She applies as the primary parent to have the child go with her. The petitioner would like Kaira to remain in Saskatchewan and have regular contact with each parent on alternating weeks. HELD: 1) The residence status quo in this case is Regina and Kaira shall, pending trial, reside in Regina. The Court cannot determine on conflicting affidavits what the primary parent status quo is. 2) It is in the best interest that the child see both parents. There was a similar course in Saskatoon that the respondent could have taken which would have made more frequent changes possible, but her affidavit indicates she thinks the Saskatoon course is inferior to the one she is taking in Victoria. 3) Pending trial the child shall be parented by the petitioner for 28 days, and thereafter by the respondent for 28 days and such parenting shall continue to alternate for each 28 day period thereafter until further order. The costs of transportation shall be born primarily by the respondent.","FIAT: This is an application to determine interim parenting for the child. There is conflicting affidavit evidence respecting the nature and extent of the father's parenting duties while the parties lived together. The mother, Lesly, has chosen to move to Victoria to attend school. She applies as the primary parent to have the child with her. The issues of parenting and mobility are clearly unresolved and may go to trial. Lesly's support network is in Regina and not in Victoria. HELD: The residence status quo in this case is Regina and Kaira shall, pending trial, reside in Regina. The primary parent status quo is Lesly. She applied as primary parent. The Mobility issues are to be determined by reference to Gordon v. Goertz (1996), 141 Sask. R. 241), 134 D.L.R. (4th) 321 and which are germane to the case.  1) There is no compelling reason to allow mobility in the case merely because the mother has made some unilateral decisions about her education. 2) Lesly will continue to live in Regina pending trial. She has made similar choices which have resulted in greater expense to insure that Kairsa sees both parents. However it is fair that Mike contribute something to this cost. 3) Costs in the cause include costs in the amount of $150 to the petitioner for the trip from Regina to Victoria. The respondent shall pay the petitioner $150 for each occasion that the child travels to Victoria for parenting time with him. If the petitioner chooses to parent in Regina, the other parent shall have telephone access to the child every second day at 7:00 p.m. Regina time during Mike’s parenting time and 7:30 am Victoria time during Lesly’S parenting time as well as the cost of transporting the child to and from Victoria. 4) The respondent will contribute some to the cost."
2009skqb445.txt,"The accused is faced with a 24 count indictment associated with allegations of involvement in the sale of controlled substances. The motion, made pursuant to s. 7, 11 and 24 of the Charter of Rights is for an order that the accused 'be provided with full disclosure in a useable format'. The motion has two components. The first relates to the method in which disclosure has been provided, the 'useable format'. The second is whether full disclosure that would allow the accused to provide a full answer and defence has been provided.  The second issue is to be dealt with by a 'Laporte inventory', name for the procedure in R. v. Laporte (1993), 113 Sask. R. 34 (C.A.).HELD: 1) There are some 30,000 to 40,000 pages of disclosure made to the defence. In addition, there are 275 audio file, 50 video files and a large series of photos. The defence seeks photocopies of all officers' notebooks organized by date and officer. The basis of the defence's argument is firstly, equality of use or a level playing field should be created with respect to the provision of documents used by the Crown and, secondly, trial fairness requires the particulars of the police officers' notes be provided in the format requested. The defence argues that if the Crown is going to be using paper copies of some documentation because it finds that use more convenient and effective, then the defence should be provide with the same paper copies to level the playing field. 2) The defence has candidly advised that the issue surrounding the defence of a serious drug charge usually starts with the validity of the search warrant, and the information used by the police in obtaining the search is crucial, not just the information that was provided to the official issuing the warrant but any information that may have been withheld. The affidavits in support of the search warrants in this case are easily found in the database, and cross- referencing to the police officers' notes in support of that information is available. What is not easily available and, for the purposes of the Crown, not relatively important is the balance of the information that may have been obtained by the officer not disclosed by affidavit. This information is often crucial for the defence. 3) In this case, given the nature of the charges, the number of police officers involved in the investigation leading up to the issuance of the warrants and cost of obtaining hard copies, the Crown should provide hard copies of the notes made by police officers in the notebooks. It is ordered that the notebooks of those officers who will be testifying at trial are to be provided to the defence in hard copy in chronological order. In all other respects, the nature and format of the disclosure provided to date is appropriate in that it has been provided in a reasonably accessible manner which does not detract from the right of the accused to make full answer and defence.  4) A useful discussion of electronic disclosure and the issues involved is found in R. v. Piaskowski, 2007 MBQB 68, in which the Court reviews extensively the use of electronic disclosure as opposed to paper disclosure.","The accused is facing a 24 count indictment generally associated with allegations of involvement in the sale of controlled substances and matters ancillary thereto. This motion, under s.7, 11(d) and 24 of the Charter of Rights and Freedoms, is for an order that the accused be provided with full disclosure in useable format. The issues are whether full disclosure that would allow the accused to provide a full answer and defence has been provided; and whether a format that is reasonably accessible to the accused. HELD: 1) There is no need for the Crown to provide copies of any officers' notebooks in hard copy and chronological order that postdates the laying of the charges or the issuance of search warrants, whichever is dated later. In this case, the nature and format of disclosure provided to date is appropriate in that it has been reasonably accessible and does not detract from the accused's right to make full answerand defence.  2) It appears to be reasonable resolution on the issue of trial fairness that if the Crown is going to be using paper copies of documents, the Crown should provide hard copies of the notes made by the RCMP officers in their notebooks. The notebooks of those officers who will be testifying at trial are to be provided to the defence in a hard copy in that format. In some cases, it would be by way of electronic disclosure or, in some situations, a combination of the two. In any event, the notebook format would be appropriate as well as the amount of time and effort it would take to obtain the notes. 3) The notebook format was appropriate as it provided a reasonably accessible manner for the disclosure provided in a reasonable accessible manner. It was appropriate to allow Crown counsel an opportunity to review some of the source documents in relation to the search warrant and to call contradictory or explanatory evidence. The utilization of the cross-referencing feature was valuable to both Crown and defence. The Crown acknowledged that it is cumbersome to obtain notes in a format such as this but did not extend that acknowledgment to any disclosure that previously had been or may be in the future utilized by the police in such a fashion. It would be preferable to embark upon a Laporte inquiry and make the appropriate order on the materials filed."
2009skqb506.txt,"The appellant landlord and mother appeals from a decision of the Hearing Officer of the Office of the Residential Tenancies dismissing her claim for possession. The landlords are mother and son. The mother lives out of province for a number of years. She returns in summers to reside in the premises. This year she wanted to return to her premises on a full time basis. She found that her son had rented out a portion of the house to a Tenant and had signed a 3 year lease. She sought an order that the Tenant vacate the premises. The Hearing Officer found he had no jurisdiction to deal with the dispute between the two landlords. He found he could only deal with the situation between the landlords and the tenant and found that the tenant had signed a lease in good faith and is entitled to the rights the lease affords and is entitled to remain in the premises. HELD: There was no valid tenancy agreement. The Act only applies to tenancy agreements and to circumstances where rental units or residential property is validly rented by a landlord to a tenant. In the circumstances, the Hearing Officer did not have jurisdiction to deal with this dispute. However, the Hearing Officer did err in law in determining that the tenant was entitled to the rights that the lease affords. 1) A room in a house is a rental unit capable of being the subject of a tenancy. 2) Clearly there was no participation by both owners in entering into this lease agreement. Mr. Koch's evidence would lead to the opposite conclusion. There was no express consent of principal and agent.  3) The facts as described by the Hearing Officer do not support an agency by estoppel. This can arise where one person has acted so as to lead another to believe that he or she has authorized a third person, without any actual authority, to act on his behalf and that other person, in such belief, enters into a transaction with that third person. The tenant here was not aware that the mother was an owner and the mother did not lead the tenant to believe that her son was authorized to act on her behalf.","The landlord appealed a decision of the hearing officer of the Residential Tenancies Office. The hearing officer found that she did not have the jurisdiction to deal with the matter and the tenant appealed. Appeal dismissed; the notice to vacate was served on the tenant by the landlord. The tenant had signed a 3-year lease in good faith and believed that the landlord was the sole owner of the property. The landlord then attempted to sell the property without consulting the tenant, who refused to sign and later refused to close the transaction. The Hearing Officer found that even if there was a written tenancy agreement, the landlord and tenant had agreed that the tenant should have at least one year's supply of security deposit and any accrued interest on the rental unit until such time as the issues were resolved. To create a fixed term tenancy of three months or longer, the tenant must enter a written agreement. Alternatively, a landlord may apply for an order pursuant to s. 70(1) of a rental unit being validly rented by a landlord to a tenant. HELD: The appeal was dismissed. 1)The tenancy agreement was not invalid. 2)The hearing officer did not erred in law in finding that there was no valid tenancy agreement between the tenant and landlord. 3)The tenant was not prejudiced by any error or omission in the lease agreement. 4)The Hearing Officer made an error in law by failing to provide sufficient notice to the tenant. 5)Section 70(f) of The residential Tenancies Act states that a landlord is estopped from denying the fact of third person's agency under the general law of estoppel, and it is immaterial whether the ostensible agent had no authority to act on behalf of and to represent the principal. Agency emerges from the express or implied consent of a landlord and agent, or by subsequent ratification by the principal of the agent's acts done on the landlord’s behalf or by estoppelle, or otherwise by operation of the principles of law. 6)Section 7 of the Act provides for a hearing officer to inquire into the circumstances of a dispute between two landlords. 7)Section 8 of the Trade Union Act provides that a person who holds a property in joint tenancy with another person must enter into written tenancy agreements. 8)The Act applies to tenancy agreements, rental units and other residential property. A hearing officer may make an order directing any person found contravening or failing to comply with a tenancy agreement or an order made pursuant to the Act to stop that contravention or failure and to deprive"
2010skqb145.txt,"The parties were in a relationship for over 5 years though they never married. The petitioner now seeks access to the respondent's daughter from an earlier relationship. The parties' relationship was tumultuous and included some incidents of domestic violence, which the child may have been exposed to. There are concerns regarding the interactions between the respondent's daughter and the petitioner's own children. The petitioner must establish, firstly, that he has 'sufficient interest' to bring this application, per s. 6(1) of The Children's Law Act, 1997. HELD: The application for access is dismissed. In determining whether a non-family applicant is a person with a sufficient interest, the Court must consider a variety of factors including: the extent or degree of the applicant's involvement in the child's life, the duration of that involvement, the level of intimacy and the quality of the relationship between the applicant and the child, how the relationship between the applicant and the child was represented to the world, and whether the applicant provided financially for the child. The petitioner has demonstrated that he is a person of sufficient interest; the relationship between the parties was not short and, during its lifespan, the petitioner formed a close bond with the child and was involved with her life. The community viewed them generally as father and daughter. However, the Court cannot conclude that requiring the child to visit the petitioner would be of any benefit to her. This child has already had to contend with multiple 'fathers' and multiple 'siblings', many of whom have been only temporary or fleeting personalities in her life. The confusion that this has no doubt caused her should not be further compounded by requiring her to make even more adjustments in her understanding of what 'family' means. Access to the petitioner is not in the best interests of this child.","HELD: The application was dismissed. The court found that the respondent was not a person with a sufficient interest. It would not elevate him above the category of persons having a'sufficient interest' under the Act. Because he was a step-parent to the petitioner, he did not need to establish that he was the person of sufficient interest to bring this application. Because of the familial relationship among the parties, and the fact that the petitioner had two younger half-siblings, the respondent had not shown any of the traits that led to the separation. The petitioner had demonstrated that she was in the best interests of the petitioner because of the relationship she had with the petitioner and because of his support and contributions to the community."
2011nssc455.txt,"The accused, who was charged with 21 counts under one indictment relating to events on two separate dates, applied to have the counts severed. First, on the basis of the dates of the occurrences and, secondly, to separate the so-called 'status offences' based on a pre-existing firearm prohibition order. It was argued the Crown had combined all the counts into one indictment to improve its evidentiary position with regard to the unproven connection of possession of the gun on the two separate dates and to be able to cross-examine the accused on the events of both days should he choose to only testify on the events of one day. The Crown argued that expert evidence showing a match between the gun used in the shooting on the first date and that found by the arresting officers on the second date showed a temporal and continuity nexus between the two events. The accused's  videotaped statement to the police was also a common piece of evidence to both dates. Application for severance dismissed. The most significant issue was the possibility of the accused being subject to cross-examination for events of both days if he chose to testify only concerning the events of one day but his position that he had no association with the gun and that it was not in his possession on either day indicated that his decision on whether to testify would most likely be the same in relation to both sets of counts and, given that there was no jury involved, there was no risk of improper inferences being drawn. The Crown should not be limited in the presentation of its evidence through a severance of counts because of the tenuous nexus between the two events.","The accused is charged with 21 counts under an indictment dated September 1, 2010 consisting of one count of attempted murder, several charges pertaining to the unlawful possession and use of a firearm, and a number of status offences based on a pre-existing firearm prohibition order. The charges relate to events which occurred between April 8 and April 14, 2010 respectively. The accused seeks severance of the 21 counts in the indictment on two bases: to allow three separate trials in all; and to separate for trial all of the so-called status offences. The only possible link conceded is the firearm which assumes an unproven connection of possession of the gun on both days. In the interests of justice the accused's statement should have both subjective and an objective component as well as society's interest in seeing that justice is done in a reasonably efficient and cost-effective manner.  HELD: The application for severance was dismissed on both the bases proposed. 1) The absence of a true nexus between the counts (a) the complexity of the evidence and the length of the trial having regard to the evidence to be called; and (c) the potential of the accused deciding to testify on one set of counts but not the others, could not be balanced with all the others.  2) There is no evidence of a causal connection between the two events, although there has been circumstantial evidence pointing to the existence of both. The causal connection is one factor to be considered. It can be counterbalanced by other circumstances that may prevent the accused from testifying or be outweighed by factors that demonstrate the interest of justice require a joint trial.  3) In the present case the court has had the benefit of watching a videotaped interview conducted by the police in the early morning hours of April 15, 2010. In that interview, the accused adamantly disclaimed any association with the subject handgun whatsoever. He maintains that the gun was not his and that he had nothing to do with it on April 8 or the 14th events. 4) The evidence that was recovered near the spot where the accused was arrested would be admissible on prosecution of April 8/April 14th if it supported an inference that he was in possession of that firearm on April 14th. If found guilty of possession in relation to that date it would be appropriate to use the videotaped statement to determine whether the accused should testify or not. The evidence set out in the decision in Last further sets out the factors that can be weighed when deciding whether to sever or not severance."
2_1999canlii12669.txt,"The respondent seeks an order for interim spousal support. The parties were married in January 1991 with three children and ceased to cohabit in December of 1996. The respondent is 52 years old and unemployed. In the past, he has been diagnosed as paranoid schizophrenic and suffering from a personality disorder but is currently, according to his physician, of sound mind. He qualifies since 1987 for a disability pension under CPP by reason of his mental disability which provides for a basic income of $580 plus GTS rebate for a total of $630 per month. The petitioner lives on a section of farm land which was brought into the marriage by the respondent, of which one quarter contains the matrimonial home. The petitioner and children live in that home. The petitioner is 39 years old and is also unemployed because she is an incomplete quadriplegic. The farm land is rented out from which the petitioner receives rental income. The petitioner enjoys an income of $3,400 per month while the respondent receives $630 per month. HELD: The petitioner is ordered to pay the respondent the annual sum of $6,000 paid in monthly installments of $500. There is no juridical reason why the petitioner should obtain the total revenue owned by the respondent particularly when he brought the land into the marriage. In fact, fairness and equity would suggest just the opposite, at least in respect to one half of the revenue. Accordingly, the Court makes an order on the basis of the respondent's ownership of the land rather than order payment of spousal support.","FIAT. The respondent sought an order for interim spousal support. HELD: The Court concluded that relief should be granted but in the circumstances it should not take the form of maintenance. Section of land owned by the petitioner was valued at $293,874. The difference in value relates to a section of land which the respondent brought into the marriage. The petitioner's share of the 1998 crop has value of $16,000. The fact remains that the respondent is in the position of not being able to obtain suitable shelter on his own and that is deplorable. The Court ordered the respondent to pay $500 per month. The Federal Child Support Guidelines would stipulate a monthly payment of $442.00 and the Canada Pension Plan Benefits were to be paid in the amount of $508.00. In addition, the respondent was to receive $1,700 by way of crop insurance."
2_2010skpc149.txt,"The accused were both charged with assault contrary to s. 266. The complainant admitted that he threw the first punch but said that he did so because the male accused had already broken the windows in his car and punched his passenger and was not 'coming to apologize.' HELD: The accused were convicted of assault. Whether the physical altercation was precipitated by jealousy or a drug deal, there is no doubt that the accused was the aggressor throughout. He smashed one, if not two, car windows. The accused's behaviour was threatening and the Court accepted that the accused had not attended the house to apologize. The complainant took necessary and lawful action to protect himself and his family under s. 37 of the Criminal Code.  While the Court did not believe that either complainant used a weapon, if it did occur it would have been justified in the context of the assault. The accused was acquitted of mischief because the Crown failed to prove the value of the broken windows.","The two accused were charged on separate informations with assaulting the complainant contrary to s. 266 of the Criminal Code and with wilfully damaging the windows of a car. HELD: The accused were found not guilty of the first count on information 24414281.  1) The physical altercation in this case was precipitated by jealousy or by a drug deal gone bad. There is no doubt that the accused were the aggressors throughout. He smashed in one, if not two, car windows. He chased after the complainant with Dagenais' help. Once at the trailer he rushed up the stairs toward the complainant. This was threatening behaviour and the complainant said he felt threatened. 2) The accused admitted to hitting the complainant three times in the face. He admitted to breaking the front passenger window of the car and breaking the rear window. 3) The Court found that both accused were justified in using force to defend themselves or any one under protection from assault if he used no more force than is necessary to prevent the assault or the repetition of it. The Court also found that the second count was justified because the complainant choked him at one point during the fight.  4) There was no evidence of any essential element of the offence. The accused testified that they got into a fistfight in the parking lot of a strip mall. The complainant was sitting in the driver's seat when the altercation took place. He was on top of the complainant when he said that he 'felt threatened.'  5) In his testimony at the hearing, the accused admitted that he choked the complainant and punched and kicked him until he fell off the stairs. The Crown and defence evidence was applied over to the other information. 6) The court found that all of the accused's testimony, except for the choked up victim, was not justified in the circumstances of the assault."

In this case, a delay of in excess of 5 years does not constitute inordinate delay when compared to the progress in comparable cases. The amount claimed is significant and there is no suggestion in the amended defence that the goods, products and related services were not provided. Subject to compliance with undertakings, the matter is ready to be referred to pre-trial settlement conference. There is no legal excuse offered on the part of the plaintiff for the inordinate delay in this case. The plaintiff bears the onus of convincing the Court on a balance of probabilities that the delay was excusable and its materials fall short. While there may be some prejudice to the defendant in mounting a defence because of the death of some of the people who were intimately involved in the dealings between the parties, there is an individual available who is intimately familiar with the dealings between the parties and there are discovery transcripts that might be of assistance. Both parties have records and documentation that can be tendered at a trial. The Court concluded that the interest of justice favored continuing with the action. The application to dismiss the action for want of prosecution was denied.","The respondent applies for the dismissal of the plaintiff's claim for want of prosecution pursuant to the inherent powers of the court. The respondent responds through its counsel that it now has every intention to diligently proceed with its action. HELD: 1) The plaintiff's delay in advancing the cause was inordinate and legally inexcusable. However, the plaintiff was also responsible for the payment by Ochapowace to McDiarmid of $100,000. The indebtedness claimed owing is $521,283.89. 2) It is in the interests of justice that the plaintiff be permitted to pursue its claim. All parties are cautioned to now proceed diligently and without delay. Failure to do so will no doubt cause the defendant to consider making a further application for dismissal. 3) The application for an order returning the $40,000 paid by the respondent to Mcdiarmid is not a relief which can be granted at this time. The question of whether or not settlement was reached, the circumstances under which this payment was made were live issues raised by the pleadings. This is an issue that must be determined by the trial judge.  4) The Court reviewed all the relevant facts, which it considered appropriate to the Carey case approach, and noted that no legally acceptable excuses had been advanced for the inordinate delay. 5) It was in the interest of justice to grant the plaintiff its costs on a party/party basis notwithstanding the costs that may ultimately be ordered in the cause."
2_2011nssc486.txt,"The parties were married almost nine years and have two children, ages eight and 10.  The mother was highly critical of the father's ability to parent, and opposed his application for shared custody. She accused him of abusive behavior, using drugs/abusing alcohol, and claimed he did not help parent when they lived together. The level of conflict between the two was high. Each lived with new partners. They both filed expense statements showing significant monthly deficits but, since they had declared bankruptcy, there was no evidence of how they were meeting the shortfall. The mother sought a share of the father's pension, including his pre-marriage contributions, spousal support and child support. She worked through most of the marriage, but earned a lot less than the father did. Interim shared parenting, with a review in eight months. This is not an ideal arrangement, but the alternatives will leave the children worse off. The father was more credible; the mother's allegations are unsubstantiated. While he's contributed to the conflict in the past, he is making an effort while the mother and her partner are not. The mother will have the final say on health related matters, and the father will have the final say on the choice of childcare and helping with homework (because he is francophone and better able to help). If the mother is unable to learn how to work with the father, the court will consider awarding him custody. On review, the court will consider the parties' ability to communicate and cooperate, including whether or not they are able to agree about extracurricular activities for the children. The father will pay child support in the set-off amount. While he has twice her income, the mother hasn't proven the set-off amount is insufficient to enable her to meet the children's needs while they're with her. It's impossible to have a deficit without disclosing the debt instruments used to support debt accumulation. Her partner is either meeting her shortfall or her expenses are overstated. It would be unfair and unconscionable to award her half of the pre-marriage pension contributions based on the length of the marriage and the fact she wasn't economically dependant on the father. She's not entitled to spousal support. Even if she was, the father has no ability to pay given his obligations to the children.","This was a divorce proceeding and the parties were in a shared parenting regime. The mother sought custody and primary care of the children, while the father was a regular user of marijuana and alcohol. The father felt that since he was paying a proportionally greater share of the day to day care expenses, the mother would have no reason to develop a better relationship with him. Therefore, the information provided by the father and his witnesses was credible. The court found that the evidence indicated that the children needed counseling because of anything their Father had done. Counsel for the children was credible and the evidence did not support any suggestion that they needed further assistance or that their current arrangement was unsustainable. As for the pre-marital pension benefits, they were not included in the calculation of child support. The evidence from the mother and her witnesses in respect to the serious and damaging allegations was not credible. Decisions about the children's care must be made by decision makers who are prepared to take into account the financial situation of the parties, particularly in the context of a change in circumstances."
2_2011skpc80.txt,"The accused was found guilty on a charge of assaulting a police officer contrary to s. 270.01(1) of the Criminal Code. The Crown applied under s. 752.1(1) for an order remanding the accused for an assessment by an expert for use as evidence in an application to have the accused declared a dangerous offender. The defence opposed the application on the basis that the predicate offence was not a serious personal injury offence and it was not within the realm of possibility that the accused could be found to be a dangerous offender. The accused was 50 years old. He had a criminal record commencing in 1976 which included 58 Criminal Code convictions. Fifteen of his prior convictions were for violent offences and six related to police officers. He had violated mandatory supervision orders on three separate occasions and had breached a conditional sentence order. The crimes of violence on his record involved the use of a weapon on more then one occasion. The facts of the predicate offence involved swinging a branch at a police officer. The officer had tasered the accused, but it had no effect. The accused grabbed a branch and swung it in sufficient proximity to cause the officer to back up, drop his taser and draw his sidearm. The officer provided a victim impact statement outlining the fear he experienced and the psychological impact the offence had on himself and his family. HELD: The offence is a serious personal injury offence as defined in s. 752. The accused picked up the branch with the intention of using it against the officer and it was of sufficient size that if the accused had struck the officer it would have caused serious damage. The accused's actions were found to have endangered or been likely to endanger the officer's life or safety and to have inflicted or been likely to inflict severe psychological damage. Given the number and nature of violent offences on the accused's record, the fact that many of the offences involve violence against police officers and the accused's prolonged issues with alcohol, a pattern of behaviour has been established. The best predictor of future behaviour is past behaviour and there is likelihood that the accused will cause injury in the future. The accused has demonstrated indifference to the reasonably foreseeable consequences to other persons of his behaviour. Given the serious nature of the offence and the accused's prior record for similar offences, a sentence of two years or more is possible.  It is not beyond the realm of possibility that the accused could be found to be a dangerous offender. The assessment under s. 752.1 was ordered.","The Crown applied pursuant to s. 752.1(1) of the Code for an order remanding the accused for an assessment performed by an expert for use as evidence in an application to have the accused declared a dangerous offender. The accused was convicted of assaulting a peace officer. HELD: The Court found that given the serious nature of the offence, which included 58 Criminal Code convictions, and the fact that the accused had been cornered by two police officers, there was no attempt to try and strike either officer. This offence was a'serious personal injury offence' as defined by the Criminal Code and the offence carried a maximum penalty of 10 years. The Court also found that in some cases the accused exhibited extreme indifference to the duties of an officer, which would make an assessment less intrusive and less intrusive."
3_1995canlii4402.txt,"The respondent expropriated a parcel of land owned by the appellant. Prior to a hearing, all claims for the case were settled for the sum of $20,000. The appellant's solicitor presented solicitor and client accounts of $19,420 plus taxes. The respondent directed taxation, and the appellant's solicitor submitted further accounts for services and disbursements of the taxation hearing amounting to $7,212.24. The taxing master received expert opinion that a reasonable fee for the services, exclusive of taxation costs, would be $10,000. He proceeded to tax the account at $14,000, disallowed any costs of the taxation hearing, and disallowed a claim for interest on interim accounts submitted by the solicitor. The appellants appealed. Dismissing the appeal and confirming the taxation, that the taxing master did not make any errors in law. He was entitled to consider as one of the relevant factors the relationship of the total account to the recovery.","The appellant appealed the City's decision to abandon the expropriation of land which included almost all of the appellant's backyard for the purpose of widening the Bedford Highway. The appellant argued that the City had disallowed any services that were actually incurred, and that the offer of full compensation for that time had not been accepted. HELD: The appeal was dismissed and the taxation of costs by the Taxing Master confirmed. 1)The appellant had no liability for any costs associated with the solicitor and client taxation, and the fact that the matter was settled did not result in costs being payable on a party and party basis. 2)The taxing master was entitled to take an overall view and to conclude there were a number of factors mandating the reduction in the solicitor's account. 3)The failure of the City to include an item of compensation for injurious affection did not render the offer one of 'full compensation for interest'. 4)The accountant had provided a copy of the decision in Charles Hardy Appraisals. The decision was based on the totality of considerations which resulted in the determination of the respondent's offer."
3_1995canlii6053.txt,"The accused was charged with failing to appear at his trial on a charge of impaired driving. The impaired driving charge was subsequently stayed. When the charge of failing to appear came on for trial the accused claimed a 'lawful excuse' for his failure to appear on the impaired driving charge. His excuse was that the next shift at work had failed to arrive on time and that this had made it impossible for him to get to court on time. This excuse was rejected and he was convicted. He appealed. HELD: Appeal dismissed.  1)Whether an accused has a lawful excuse is determined with reference to common law principles. It normally includes all of the defences which the common law considers sufficient reason to excuse a person from criminal liability. 2)The Court was unable to say that the finding by the trial judge that the accused had no lawful excuse for failing to attend court, was not supported by the evidence; nor could it say her conclusions were clearly wrong so as to make the decision unreasonable.",The accused sought to overturn his conviction for failing to attend court by arguing that the trial judge ought to have accepted his excuse for not appearing. At issue was whether the accused advanced a 'lawful excuse' for not attending court. HELD: The appeal was allowed on appeal. 1)The trial judge rejected the accused's submission that he had a lawful excuse for failure to attend. 2)The s.7(3) of the Criminal Code provides that all common law defences are not frozen in time. They can be developed and tailored to fit changes in the law and new offences. There was no doubt that Parliament can redefine the meaning of 'excuse' for example by expanding it to provide new excuses or excuses specific to a particular offence or by narrowing it to include only certain excuses.
3_1997canlii11217.txt,"Three brothers who carried on a family farm operation and family farm implement dealership applied for a receiving order against the respondent who had been in two real estate partnerships with them. The Partnerships sustained heavy operating losses since 1989 and the petitioners had made large capital contributions on behalf of the defaulting partners in order to prevent the Partnerships from defaulting on the mortgages. The defaulting partners obtained the benefits of business losses which they used to offset their other sources of income and to decrease their personal income tax liability by significant amounts, obtaining benefits without paying for them. The petitioners alleged that Ashton had committed three acts of bankruptcy within the six months prior to filing the petition including ceasing to pay liabilities as they became due in failing to make payments to the petitioners, making a fraudulent conveyance to his wife and disposing of his property with intent to defraud or defeat his creditors by permitting his interest in the Securities to be purportedly seized by his wife. HELD: A receiving order was granted. 1)No adequate explanation was offered by Ashton who was a wealthy individual for his failure to pay his partnership obligations. It was common ground that Ashton had paid nothing toward his partnership obligations since 1993. The defendant admitted that he was indebted to the petitioners in the amount of approximately $278,758 and that he had received substantial tax advantages as a result of his involvement in the two partnerships.  2)The majority of the respondent's wealth consisted of the Securities purportedly seized by his wife in 1996. The preservation order was continued for 30 days to permit the Trustee in Bankruptcy to determine whether the bankruptcy estate wished to challenge these transactions.","The petitioner brothers were three brothers from the District of Perdue, Saskatchewan who carry on a family farm operation and operate a family-owned farm implement dealership business. In 1985, the accountant for the respondent advised the brothers that they should become involved in certain real estate partnerships in order to derive certain tax advantages. The petitioner, who had recently become a professional hockey player, left the partnership in 1996. Changes in the membership of the partnership occurred by unanimous agreement between the existing members of the Partnerships. In 1996, the Registrar in Bankruptcy granted an ex parte order directed against the petitioner and his wife, Susan Ashton, requiring them to preserve and retain intact and in specie various market securities (the Securities) previously owned by them and purportedly'seized' by Susan Ashton pursuant to an alleged security interest granted in her favour by the respondent. In 1997, the petitioner filed notice of disputing petition. HELD: 1)The petitioner was indebted to the petitioner in the amounts claimed and had ceased to meet his liabilities generally as they becomedue. It was common ground that the petitioner had paid nothing toward his partnership obligations since 1993. The Petitioners had repeatedly demanded that he pay the indebtedness owing to them. No adequate explanation had been offered by the petitioner for his failure to pay his obligation.  2)There was no extenuating circumstances which would warrant the Court to refuse to grant a receiving order.  3)The material discloses the very substantial financial hardships visited upon the petitioner as a result of the refusal to pay their indebtedness by him. Further, the evidence establishes that the respondent is awealthy individual who is quite capable of paying his debts, but has simply chosen not to do so. He earned over $1.4 million dollars in his last four years as a pro hockey player in the NHL. He has the means to pay these debts and should be required to pay them.  4)Costs were spoken to."

The father would have access on alternating weekends and for a three hour period one weekday provided the child was returned by the bedtime set by the mother. Although both parents genuinely love the child and were equally competent caregivers, neither demonstrated that sole parenting offered an advantage to him.

The youth was facing a variety of charges including failure to comply with conditions of an undertaking; failure to attend court; possession of property obtained by crime; obstructing a police officer. He requested the Youth Court appoint counsel after his Legal Aid lawyer withdrew. Both parents were on social assistance. The matter was adjourned to investigate the possibility of an aunt providing financial assistance but the youth advised in April that she was unable to do so. HELD: The application was dismissed. The Youth Court judge did not err in refusing to direct counsel be appointed. The Youth Court judge's discretion is not limited solely to considerations of financial inability.

HELD: The application was dismissed. 1)The judge did not err in refusing to direct the applicant have counsel appointed to him. The application is accordingly dismissed. 2)It has been held that once young people makes request of the Youth Court for representation by counsel the exercise of discretion is no longer an option and the making of an order becomes mandatory. A young person without financial assistance could, ad infinitum, disqualify himself from legal representation by his own misconduct or discharge his counsel for whatever reason and insist on the appointment of substitute counsel.

Inability may be asserted for other reasons and the court is entitled to inquire into the foundation."
3_2002skca56.txt,"A complaint was made in 1991 to the Human Rights Commission that the Gallery could only be entered by stairs and was inaccessible to wheelchair users. A Board of Inquiry appointed under the Saskatchewan Human Rights Code concluded in 1993 that the appellant's complex impeded physical access to the premises, facilities and services and lacked proper amenities for persons who are wheelchair-reliant. The Board specifically ordered it remained seized of the matter and the hearing would be reconvened to hear further evidence. The Court of Queen's Bench confirmed the Gallery continued to discriminate against disabled members of the public by failing to provide access and accessible services and ordered the appellant to construct or renovate washrooms to meet requirements of the National Building Code of Canada. The Court of Appeal set aside the Queen's Bench decision and restored the Board's decision. During those proceedings, the property was transferred to HKR, which undertook further renovations. In 1997 upon request by the Commission, the Board reconvened and concluded there had not been compliance, which was confirmed by the Court of Queen's Bench. This was not appealed. An appeal of the Board's 1998 order to construct or renovate the bathrooms was dismissed and it was found the Board did not err in adding HKR as a party nor exceeded its jurisdiction in finding the appellant had not complied with the original order. The appellant appealed that judgment principally on the ground of error in not finding the Board exceeded its jurisdiction in making the order as the original order did not include a requirement that it construct wheelchair accessible washrooms. HELD: The appeal was dismissed with costs on double Column V. The Queen's Bench judge did not err in finding the appellant could not, at that stage of proceedings, question the original order made by the Board in 1993 (ordering the appellant to cease impeding physical access to the premises, facilities and services). The issue had been previously determined and the order was reinstated by the Court of Appeal. The Board acted entirely within the terms of its original order. It retained jurisdiction to confirm compliance. The original order cannot be challenged at this late date.","The appellant appeals the decision of the Board of Inquiry appointed by the Minister of Justice under The Saskatchewan Human Rights Code which found that the appellant continued to discriminate against disabled members of the public by failing to provide access and accessible services to wheelchair users and ordered the appellant to construct or renovate washrooms to meet the accessibility requirements of the National Building Code of Canada 1995. The appellant appeals contending that the Board exceeded its jurisdiction in making the order that it did. HELD: Appeal dismissed. The Board acted entirely within the terms of its original order, an order in which it had retained jurisdiction, to confirm compliance with the order and which had been confirmed by this Court. The extent of the order, that is whether it was confined to external access of the property or to other 'facilities and services', whether it had been complied with is the very question the Board reserved jurisdiction to determine.

3_2003canlii64101.txt,"The mother moved for the dismissal of the pending permanent care trial, arguing that, applying the reasoning in a recent Court of Appeal decision, the court had lost jurisdiction. No trial had been held on any issue as all matters had proceeded to this point with the consent of the parties. The time for trial had been extended to allow the mother to retain counsel. Application dismissed; the court had not lost jurisdiction; trial to proceed. The Court of Appeal decision stands for the proposition that, once a trial at any stage of the Act is held, no order can have effect beyond the next statutory deadline; however, this is so only when the extensions are included in an order which follows trial. When the best interests of the child require it, an extension of a statutory deadline can be made in order to have a trial completed in respect of any stage of the Act. When the plan of care changes from reunification to permanent care close to the particular deadline, it is not in a child's best interest for the court to order a rushed trial date.","The child protection proceeding in respect of the child who was under the age of six when taken into care was delayed for a number of reasons. The primary child protection concerns that were advanced by the agency were such that the original agency planning for the reunification of the mother and child required some psychological counselling. Counsel for the mother made a motion that based on the rule in B.F. I had lost my jurisdiction and must dismiss the matter. HELD: The motion was dismissed. 1)The Court had not lost its jurisdiction in this matter and the trial was to commence tomorrow. 2)Reapprehension will expose the child to the very delay the deadlines are designed to avoid since each of the stages set out in the Act (interim hearing, protection finding and at least one disposition hearing) will have to run their course, in the absence of consent to consolidation under s40(2) of the Act. 3)When the plan of care changes from reunification to permanent care close to the particular deadline, it is not in a child's best interest for a rushed trial date. There may be need for the preparation of expert reports and other trial preparation and to ascertain whether ongoing further services would have resolved the problem. 4)Any attempt after the trial to make a continued intervention order of any type would not be possible in the circumstances."

The accused admitted to consuming one vodka cooler before driving but argued the signs of impairment were manifestations of his panic attack. No .08 charge was laid, as his readings were .07 and .06. HELD: The accused was found guilty of impaired driving. The evidence did not support the argument that he was in the throws of a panic attack. The blood-alcohol readings show he was below the legal limit but the signs and symptoms of impairment by alcohol proved beyond a reasonable doubt his ability to operate a motor vehicle was impaired by alcohol. As stated in McCallum, the fact that the effects of alcohol may have been exacerbated by the accused suffering from fatigue does not provide a defence to the charge.","The accused was charged with having the care or control of a motor vehicle while his ability to operate it was impaired by alcohol or drugs. The accused's evidence which was to the effect that he was suffering from a panic attack, raised a reasonable doubt as to his guilt. HELD: The accused was found guilty. 1)The accused had been diagnosed as suffering from generalized anxiety disorder (G.A.D.). 2)The symptoms of impairment displayed by the accused were the manifestations of his panic attack not from the consumption of alcohol. 3)The medical evidence did not support the accused's diagnosis of either impairment or of panic disorder.

The Workers' Compensation Board denied the claim finding that the deceased was not found dead at work and because of the delay in bringing the claim. The applicant brought an application for an order of certiorari pursuant to Queen's Bench Rule 664 and mandamus pursuant to Queen's Bench Rule 674. HELD: 1) The Board acted outside of its jurisdiction in denying dependant benefits to the applicant based upon a determination that the deceased was not found dead within the meaning of s. 30 of The Workers' Compensation Act, 1979. The case law clearly precludes an analysis of s. 30 of the Act as in any way representing a rebuttable presumption. 2) The Board acted outside its jurisdiction in not applying the presumption in s. 30 of the Act in favour of the applicant. 3) The Board waived the right to rely upon the delay in bringing the claim after the Board participated in a variety of levels of proceeding, including two hearings, and only raised the issue of delay at the final hearing. 4) The application was allowed with costs to the applicant on a party and party basis.","The applicant sought an order by way of certiorari pursuant to Rule 664 of the Queen's Bench Rules of Court, to quash the decision of the Workers' Compensation Board which denied the applicant's application for benefits based upon its finding that the deceased spouse was not found dead within the meaning of s. 30 of the Worker's Compensation Act. The applicant had become aware of the potential benefits in early July 2001 during a casual conversation at her workplace and suggested that her husband had been performing work duties while he was on campus to attend class or to study. The Board denied the application based upon two alternative grounds: the delay in bringing the claim, and the fact that the respondent was not 'found dead' at the time of his death. HELD: The application for dependants' benefits was denied. 1)Section 45(1)(b) of the Act provides for a six month limitation period for applications in which the respondent is ordered to report to the Board any medical findings, discoveries, discoveries or discoveries made. 2)The privative clause determined that the standard of review will generally be one of patent unreasonableness. 3)While s.22 does not shield the Board's decision from judicial review when the Board exercises its discretion to decide a matter but the legislation did not 'intend to commit the matter exclusively to the board' in the case of the deceased, s.45 does. 4)The respondent Board did not properly or impartially apply the presumption in s.30 that it did not apply in favour of the applicant. 5)Section 47(1) does not bar the respondent Board from taking the Board beyond the discretion afforded them by the statute. 6)In this case, the applicant was awarded costs of the application."

HELD: Appeal allowed. 1)Because the accused had no related record and given the circumstances of the assault, the sentence of imprisonment was reduced to time already served (15 days). 2)The trial judge erred in imposing the 10 year fire arm prohibition under S.100 of the Code. S.100 requires a conviction on an indictable offence involving violence against a person where the maximum sentence available is 10 years imprisonment or more. 3)The maximum sentence for assault under S.266 is 5 years if the Crown proceeds by indictment and 6 months if, as here, the Crown proceeds summarily.","The accused pled guilty to a charge of assault contrary to s. 266 of the Criminal Code and was sentenced to a term of 6 months imprisonment and to enter into a probation order for an 18 month term of 18 months on certain specific conditions.

Counsel for the appellant reviewed the circumstances surrounding the commission of the offence and particularly that this was his first offence, his only previous conviction having occurred in 1989 when he was convicted of an '08' offence at a time whenhe was only about 20 years of age. He submitted that in the particular circumstances the term of imprisonment imposed was too severe and ought to be reduced to the time already served.

The judge declined to cite the respondent for contempt.,"FIAT. Following a trial before the court in November 1993, a judgment issued dealing with a number of issues including the division of matrimonial property. At issue was the issuance of a fiat directing that nothing removed from the matrimononial home or any assets disposed of until further ordered. The respondent had not even unpacked a good part of what he took away. HELD: 1)The court was left with no alternative but to assist the petitioner in regaining the assets taken out of the house by granting the order sought subject to one or two modifications. 2)The law permits the court to vary its judgment and to give directions on how the judgment should be carried out whether or not a formal order is issued by the Court. This has long been the law in this province. 3)The prayer for relief requested an order pursuant to Rule 344 of the Queen's Bench Rules committing the respondent to return the list of items referred to above as well as any costs or poundage levied by the Sheriff. Counsel for the respondent took issue with the jurisdiction of the Court to deal with the relief sought by the applicant on the ground that no formal extension of my judgment of December has ever been issued. 4)The applicant attached to her affidavit a list of household contents and personal items removed by the respondent in order to allow for aWrit of Delivery. 5)A writ of delivery was ordered for all outstanding utility payments and other expenses associated with his occupation of the home up to and including December 1993, as wellas any losses experienced as the result of no insurance coverage between September 28, 1993 and December 29, 1993. 6)The respondent was ordered not to dispose of the said items without leave of Court."

HELD: Appeal dismissed and conviction accordingly affirmed.  1)Great deference to findings of credibility made at trial should be shown. 2)The trial judge did not say that he found the accused guilty only upon the credibility of the complainant and the accused. He said that he found the Crown's evidence to be credible, and the accused's evidence not to be credible. The Crown's evidence was comprised of both the complainant and the witness. 3)The trial judge's findings are supported by the evidence and his conclusions are not clearly wrong so as to make the conviction unreasonable.","The appellant contended that the Provincial Court judge so concerned himself with the credibility of the evidence of the complainant and the accused that he overlooked his duty to consider such evidence with a view to determining whether it raised a reasonable doubt of the appellant's guilt. HELD: 1)The accused was convicted of the assault contrary to s. 266 of the Criminal Code.  2)The trial judge did not fail to take into account his own evidence, particularly the complainant's evidence, with respect to the accused's evidence. 3)Although the accused had been acquitted of all charges, the appeal against conviction should have been allowed."
4_2007skqb438.txt,"The parties have two children, a son born March 1990 and a daughter December 1991. A trial on the issues of the son's residence in 2006, the parties' income for the purposes of child support and any s. 7 expenses was held. HELD: 1) From September 2006 to February 2007 the parties shared custody of the son. This is a period of no more than 5 months. Thereafter he resumed living with his grandmother and was supported by his mother. The father does not meet the threshold provided for in s. 9 of the Guidelines.  2) The father's income from employment shows earning of $108,629. The mother's income consisted only of investment income of $1,672.37 and allowance of $2,000. 3) The parties have been divorced since 1998. The son has played baseball since 2004. The daughter has speed skated since 2001. The mother has paid the extraordinary expenses of both children, without reimbursement from the father. It was only in 2006 that the father paid any of the son's expenses. Accordingly, 2006 is not the appropriate year to begin reimbursing the father for expenses he may have paid for him. To do so would be exceedingly unfair to the mother who has borne the expenses of both children on her own for many years.  4) The children's expenses related to fees, registration and equipment for baseball and speed skating are extraordinary expenses within the meaning of s. 7 of the Guidelines. The expenses may be estimated at $2,000 for baseball and $1,000 for speed skating, annually. The orthodontic work, which is estimated at $2,522 should be amortized over two years. The alternative acne treatment, proposed by the mother for the daughter is not an appropriate health related expense in the absence of a medical referral or prescription. The father's proportionate share is 80% and the mother's is 20%. Paid monthly the father's payment is $284. 5) Although the mother did not bring an application to vary child support upward, the filing of the application to vary by the father is sufficient to re-determine the issue of child support based on current incomes. The current support order is based on the father's income of $87,794. His income is considerably higher now. His child support payments are adjusted accordingly.","The respondent father applied to vary an order made May 14, 2002 for child support payable to the petitioner mother on behalf of his two youngest children, Michael, born March 15, 1990, and Jessica, born December 30, 1991. Although the agreement stipulated that he live with his maternal grandmother, the mother paid the extraordinary expenses of both children; the orthodontic work needed by the father and the medical/dental fees not covered by his employer's insurer also fell within s. 7. The parties did not speak to one another, notwithstanding the difficulty it undoubtedly caused their children. HELD: 1)The parties were responsible for their proportionate share of expenses according to their income. 2)The father was to pay $1,486 per month in spousal support for 2006, based on his income of $25,672.37. Section 7 of the Guidelines provides the court with discretion in awarding child support in shared custody situations to ensure fairness. 3)The mother did not bring an application to vary child support upward. The filing of the application was sufficient to re-determine the issue of child support based on current incomes. 4)The onus is on the parent wishing to invoke the operation of s. to demonstrate to the court's satisfaction that a shared custody arrangement as contemplated by s. is in fact in place and will be in place over a course of year. While it is not necessary that there be in all circumstances written or commissioned by the parties, the Court must take into account the amounts set out in the applicable tables for each of the spouses; any increased costs associated with the shared custody arrangements; and the condition, means, needs and other circumstances of each parent and children for whom support is sought."
4_2007skqb51.txt,"FIAT: The respondent applies for an interim order granting her sole custody of the parties' two children and child support retroactive to the date of separation being October 2005. The petitioner seeks joint custody with specified access. The petitioner acknowledges an obligation to pay child support but there is an issue with respect to his income and whether the interim order should be retroactive. The children are ages 3 and 2.HELD: 1) Section 3 of The Children's Law Act 1997 provides for a presumption of joint custody where parents of a child have cohabitated after the birth of the child. That is the situation here. There is nothing in the evidence to rebut that presumption on an interim basis. In making interim orders, the Court tries to disrupt the lives of the children as little as possible. The status quo in this case is represented by the verbal agreement between the parties entered into after their separation. That is the petitioner would have the children every third week during his week off from Saturday to Tuesday. This seems reasonable on an interim basis. This agreement did not address the fact that the petitioner shall be laid off for two months in the spring. It is reasonable that during this period his contact with the children should be increased. The petitioner has not seen the children for 10 months. He will have to be re-introduced to them. A phase in period is required. 2) The petitioner has worked for the same drilling company for about 6 years. His gross income in 2006 was $112,064. This is verified by his year to date income statement from his employer. The petitioner attests that $9,600 of his income is a 'living allowance' paid to cover expenses for his truck, fuel, vehicle maintenance and meals and should be deducted from his Line 150 income to arrive at his current income for child support purposes. This is a matter for the trial judge who will have the benefit of the 2006 tax return and notice of assessment and better evidence of the expenses and their purpose and make any retroactive adjustment deemed necessary. The petitioner's income for child support purposes is $112,064. 3) The claim for retroactive child support is a claim for child support payments which pre-date service of the notice of this application. The petitioner was served with the application in September 2006. The petitioner lived up to the parties' verbal agreement to pay child support of $1,200 per month starting October 2005. He unilaterally stopped paying child support in January 2006. He attests that his reason for doing so was because he was not having access to the children. The obligation to pay child support is not contingent on a payor's ability to see their children.  The respondent's income is substantially less then that of the petitioner's. The child support was necessary to meet the children's basis ongoing needs. The petitioner knew he had an obligation to provide child support and there is no evidence that a retroactive order would cause him undue hardship. There is evidence that a request for change in child support preceded the commencement of this application. A retroactive adjustment of child support to January 2006 is warranted.","FIAT: The respondent applies for an interim order granting sole custody of the parties' two children and child support, including s. 7(a) child care expenses retroactive to the date of separation, October 2005. The petitioner, who is employed as hotel supervisor, has not seen the children for the past six months. HELD: 1) The respondent shall continue to pay child support of $185 per month directly to the child care provider which represents one-half of the current child care costs (before tax considerations) for employment purposes.  2) The parties' verbal agreement following their separation that the petitioner would have the children during his week off from Saturday to Tuesday was not made in writing and signed by both parties. There was nothing in the evidence before the trial judge that rebutted that presumption on an interim basis. A retroactive adjustment of child support to January 1, 2006 is warranted. 3) The company in issue is in its startup phase. There is insufficient evidence to establish what cash is available and whether it could be withdrawn without affecting the financial viability of the company. The status quo in this case is represented by the verbal agreement between the parties that the living allowance ($9,600), which includes expenses for his truck, fuel, vehicle maintenance and meals, should be deducted from his Line 150 income to arrive at his current income for child support purposes. 4) As the results of the within application are mixed, costs of this application shall be in the cause."
4_2008skqb174.txt,"Accused pleaded guilty at opening of trial to one count of distributing child pornography in the form of written works. The accused was active on a pedophile website and posted 11 stories describing sexual activity between men and infants and pre-teen girls. HELD: Accused received 15 months imprisonment followed by 3 years of probation with addition orders including providing DNA samples and being added to the Sex Offender Registry. The Court accepted that the internet has led to the accelerated proliferation of child pornography, making it an increasing social problem. The social harm of such material is borne almost exclusively by infants and children, the most defenceless members of society. For this reason, denunciation and deterrence are the dominant sentencing principles. The defence submitted that the writings do not actually harm children in their making and, therefore, should not be subject to the same denunciation as pornographic images. The Court rejected this argument because it cannot be assumed that the writings do not stimulate the demand for images and since not all pedophiles are voyeurs only some will act on their desires and anything that stimulates this desire places children at risk in the real world. Aggravating factors in this case were 1) the fact that the accused extolled pedophilia and wrote hard core child pornography and encouraged others to the same. 2) The accused was a high profile contributor to the web site and he remains unrepentant Ã» he does not believe there is anything wrong with writing these stories and only stopped because the law requires it. A conditional sentence would not represent sufficient denunciation or deterrence. Mitigating factors in this case included a lack of criminal record, the guilty plea and the fact that the accused is looking after his elderly mother.","The offender pled guilty at the opening of trial to distributing child pornography contrary to s. 163.1(3) of the Criminal Code. The offender had 1,200 postings on the website, which included 11 stories that were the subject of the charge. The site encouraged stories, and the offender encouraged others to submit stories. HELD: The offender was sentenced to 15 months imprisonment to be followed by a term of probation of 3 years, as well as the addition of an order requiring him to comply with the Sex Offender Information Registration Act, 2004 for a period of 20 years. The terms of the three-year probation order were as follows: 1) Keep the peace and be of good behaviour; 2) Appear before the court when required to do so by the court; Report to supervisor within two working days from the date of release from jail and thereafter continue to report as directed by the supervisor; 3) Denounce and deterrence are the dominant principles of sentencing. The Crown submission that the writings do not in their production actually harm children the way production of images does, and therefore should not be subject to the same denunciation, was rejected. The Court found that the offender was more of a voyeur than actively sexual with girls and that his stories were told to encourage others to produce similar stories in order to deter others who might be inclined to engage in the same activity."
4_2009skca102.txt,"The respondent pled guilty to a charge of manslaughter arising out of fatal injuries she inflicted on her 7 month old daughter. The sentencing judge awarded the respondent 26 months credit for 13 months in pre-trial custody and then imposed a sentence of 2 years less 1 day to be followed by 2 years probation. The Crown seeks leave to appeal the sentence imposed as demonstrably unfit. HELD: Appeal allowed. 1) Taking into account the mitigating factors and in particular the respondent's post-sentence rehabilitative potential and the absence of evidence of prior acts of violence, a sentence slightly below the range as the one imposed in R. v. Bighead, 2003 SKCA 44 leads the Court to conclude a sentence of 6 years is appropriate, with 26 months credit for remand as imposed below.  2) The sentencing judge was directed to a very narrow range of authorities. In these circumstances this Court cannot find that the judge failed to give proper weight to the gravity of the offence and the degree of the respondent's responsibility. It would be helpful if a more detailed analysis along the lines suggested in R. v. Laberge (1995), 165 A.R. 375 had been given in order to enhance meaningful appellate review. However, this Court is not satisfied the judge failed to properly consider this factor. The Court is satisfied that the limited framework presented by counsel led the judge to err by failing to observe the need for parity in sentence and as a result, the sentence imposed was not similar to sentences imposed on other offenders for similar offences committed in similar circumstances.","The respondent pled guilty to manslaughter arising out of the fatal injuries she inflicted on her seven-month-old daughter. The sentencing judge awarded her 26 months credit for 13 months in pre-trial custody and then imposed a sentence of 2 years less 1 day to be followed by 2 years probation. The Crown sought leave to appeal the sentence imposed as demonstrably unfit. HELD: The appeal should be allowed on the basis of this ground. 1) The essential facts are not in dispute. The respondent was a heavy cocaine user and had a troubled history of abuse, domestic abuse and sexual abuse. The parties agreed upon the range of sentences in manslaughter cases and the only cases referred to the sentencing judge were Hathway, supra, and Schoenthal. These cases showed that the respondent had compelling personal circumstances but failed to take into account the factors that led her to commit the offence. 2) The respondent's dysfunctional upbringing or dysfunctional life was put forth by the Crown as an aggravating factor. The judge did not refer to a decision in R. v. Hathway where it held that a reasonable starting point for a custodial sentence for unlawful act manslaughter is seven years.  3) The Court was satisfied the sentence should be increased to 12 years because of the factors identified as aggravating factors. 4) There were no mitigating factors identified in the sentence including the respondent's mental health problems, her past criminal record, her abusive background which may have caused symptoms of PTSD and her social and economic situation."
4_2011nssc71.txt,"The judge declared the defendants could pay legal fees from third party loans without offending two prior execution orders that prevented them from disposing of any property. The declaration was explicitly made on the assumption that the loans would not be secured against the defendants' existing assets. Later, the defendants' counsel wrote to the court essentially indicating he could not confirm the loans would not be secured against any assets. The court issued this supplemental decision. In the absence of any evidence the loans will not be secured against assets already subject to the execution order, or will not otherwise reduce those assets, the order and declaration sought can no longer be granted.","The defendants sought an order confirming their ability to pay certain amounts for billed and unbilled time without violating the terms of two execution orders previously issued against them, as Hfx No. 190408 against the judgment debtors to the plaintiff and Sable Mary Seismic, who were successful litigants in this action. HELD: The defendants were ordered to pay the retainers and legal fees referred to in the decision. The court was unable to grant the order that accompanied the notice in the matter of costs."
4_2015skca111.txt,"Family – Child Support – Arrears – Appeal The appellant appealed from the decision of a Queen’s Bench judge ordering him to pay retroactive child support to the respondent in the amount of $21,645. The order indicated that the period in question would include support from January 2009 to August 2012 (see: 2014 SKQB 334). An original support order was issued by consent in 2006. It required that the appellant pay the respondent $1,220 per month in child support and that the parties would exchange their financial information yearly in order to adjust the amount of child support payable. In 2008, the appellant applied to vary the order because he had lost his position and his income was reduced to $1,500 per month. In his affidavit, he swore that his annual income would be $18,000. The application was allowed and the amount of support reduced to $769 per month based upon the judge setting the appellant’s income at $55,000 and directing him to provide his financial information to the respondent each year. One month later in 2009, the appellant regained his former employment position and began earning as much as he had in 2008 but he continued to pay $769 per month without informing the respondent of the change in his circumstances. In February 2011, the respondent served a notice to disclose. The parties met and made an oral agreement that the appellant would pay $950 per month based upon the appellant’s claim that he was still financially strapped and the respondent acquiesced because she was unwilling to engage in further court battles with him. The appellant’s lawyer provided the respondent’s lawyer with financial information that showed that the former was earning a substantially higher income. The respondent also indicated to the appellant that she would forgo about $7,200 in arrears. The terms of the agreement were submitted to the court, without the financial information or the respondent’s forbearance to sue, and a variation order was issued based upon them. In July 2012, the respondent applied to vary the 2008 order and the 2011 variation order claiming arrears from January 2009. Eventually the issue of retroactive child support went to trial. The trial judge found that the appellant had not given the respondent financial information as was required and his failure to inform her of the material change in his circumstances in 2009 constituted blameworthy conduct. The appellant’s income for the years 2009 through 2012 was assessed by the court and the amount of arrears established. The appellant argued that: 1) the trial judge did not have the jurisdiction to vary the 2011 variation order. He maintained that the 2011 order was final and could not be varied on an interim basis; 2) it was necessary to find a material change in circumstances before it could be varied; 3) the respondent had been advised of the change in circumstances; and 4) the trial judge had erred in failing to find unreasonable delay on the part of the respondent.  HELD: The appeal was dismissed. The court held with respect to each issue that: 1) a court can vary an interim or a final order on an interim basis for child support under the authority of ss. 15 and 17 of the Divorce Act. Although it might be necessary in some cases to determine whether an order is final or interim, it was not necessary to do so here because the nature of the terms of the orders in question and the circumstances surrounding the granting of the 2011 variation order. The trial judge had not erred in concluding that he had authority to vary it and to order the appellant to pay arrears before the agreement and compelling him to pay the Guideline amount for the period following it; 2) the terms of the 2011 order left it to a future court to finalize the amount of child support based upon the appellant’s income. Therefore the court retained the power to vary or rescind the order without searching for a change in circumstances; 3) the trial judge’s findings of fact on this point were supported by the evidence; and 4) the trial judge found that the respondent had not received disclosure and thus there had been no unreasonable delay.","In October 2014, Turcotte J. ordered the defendant to pay retroactive child support for a period of time varying from January 2009 to August 2012 inclusive. The parties had agreed in May 2011 to fix support by varying the 2011 Variation Order. In September 2012, the defendant abandoned his request to change the primary residence of his former spouse to a different residence and applied to the Court of Queen's Bench for an order varying the amount of child support payable by the parties. The defendant filed an application for variation of the variation order in which he alleged that the court had the authority to order the payment of retroactive support both before and after that date. Application dismissed; the court drew a clear distinction between interim orders, which can be varied on an interim basis as a matter of jurisdiction, and final orders. The court had not been asked to overrule Frey."
5_1994canlii4866.txt,"The Plaintiff's 1989 Ford F150 1/2 ton truck caught fire and burned in his garage. This model of truck was subject to a recall by Ford to correct a fuel line defect. The Plaintiff called several expert witnesses who testified that, in their opinion, the leaking fuel line was the cause of the fire. Ford called one witness who was the designer of of the truck's fuel system and a Ford employee. He testified that the defective fuel line could not have leaked sufficient fuel to cause the fire. He also admitted, however, that his prior written report contained errors. Rebuttal evidence called by the Plaintiff indicated that the check valve in the fuel pump designed to prevent siphoning from the fuel tank in the event of a leaking fuel line did not operate as the Ford witness had testified. HELD: Judgment for the Plaintiff. The Plaintiff had proved on a balance of probabilities that the leaking fuel line was the cause of the fire. The Plaintiff's experts' evidence was accepted over that of the Ford expert. No independent experts had been called by Ford.","The plaintiffs claim against Ford for damages from a fire in their garage which they allege was caused by combustion of vapours from gasoline leakage from the fuel tube of a new truck they purchased from Ford. The action against Country Plaza was discontinued. HELD: 1)The plaintiffs' theory as to how the fire started was proven beyond a balance of probabilities. Due to extreme winter weather the electrical insulating qualities of the nylon fuel line were reduced to an extent that the accumulated static electricity discharged through the fuel line. During this static discharge, pin holes would be created and gasoline would leak out. There would be a flashback to the area underneath the truck where the gasoline was pooled. This would likely be in the wash tray which was located under the vehicle and which Clarence used to wash his truck. 2)The Court accepted the expert testimony of the plaintiffs and their expert testimony in preference to the defendant. 3)Although the plaintiffs had received a recall notice several weeks prior to the fire, the subsequent recall notice deleted any reference to off-road driving. 4)The plaintiff was awarded the sum of $50,000 awarded to the plaintiff for general damages and the $10,000 ordered in the amount of general damages. 5)The court was satisfied that the plaintiff's evidence as to the cause and origin of the fire was not solely based on the defendant's faulty fuel system. The evidence as a whole led only to one conclusion: that the plaintiffs' evidence was accurate. 6)The defendant never called any independent witnesses on their behalf and their only witness was an employee of the company."
5_1995canlii4187.txt,"This was an appeal from the conviction of the appellant that he broke and entered a used car dealership and stole a vehicle, contrary to s. 348(1)(b) of the Criminal Code. The theft was reported to police by a passing motorist who saw the vehicle being driven off the car lot early in the morning. The vehicle was spotted on the highway, and when stopped, was exited by two individuals. Two officers followed tracks through a wooded area, and noted that in two areas the tracks broke through ice on a brook. Shortly thereafter the appellant came out of the woods on a nearby road; his lower body was wet and chunks of ice and snow clung to his clothing. The imprint of his footwear resembled that of the tracks in the snow. The appellant was convicted, based on the doctrine of recent possession. He argued there was no evidence he was in recent possession of the stolen vehicle. Dismissing the appeal, that there was sufficient evidence to support the findings of fact made by the trial judge. The judgment of the trial judge was consistent with R. v. Kowlyk (1988), 43 C.C.C. (3d) 1 (S.C.C.).","The appellant contended the trial judge erred in law by applying the doctrine of recent possession mainly because there was no evidence that he was in recent possession of the stolen Chevrolet Blazer. Dismissing the appeal, that although the evidence was circumstantial, the facts found to be proved led to no other reasonable inference than the guilt of the appellant. The appellant ran from the vehicle and made the tracks in the snow which were followed by the police. The time periods for each and all of these events were consistent with his findings of fact."
5_1998canlii13955.txt,"An application pursuant to s197 of the Automobile Accident Insurance Act for an order setting aside SGI's termination of the applicant's income replacement benefits. The applicant suffered soft tissue injuries to his cervical spine when his vehicle was struck from behind by an uninsured driver. He received a partial income replacement benefit from SGI on the basis he was not able to perform some but not all of his farm duties. HELD: 1)SGI was not entitled to terminate Sawkiw's benefits pursuant to s185(d), (e), (f) or (g). SGI's failure to make a suitable rehabilitation program available to Sawkiw prior to October 1/97 and its failure to reassess his level of income replacement benefits as at September 14 where significant factors contributing to his desperate circumstances. SGI was requiring Sawkiw to attend daily physiotherapy of 3 to 4 hours duration with approximately 2-1/2 hours of additional travel time. It is common knowledge that pain can be exhausting; that daily physiotherapy can be exhausting; that daily travel of 2-1/2 hours can be exhausting; that the physical demands of farming can be exhausting; and, that the mental demands of managing a farm and coordinating and organizing the work of others on a farm can be exhausting. It was far from clear how SGI expected Sawkiw to devote approximately 6 to7 hours per day to his treatment program and still have the mental and physical reserves to devote any time or energy to his farming oprations. He could only reasonably be expected to participate in daily physiotherapy if he was receiving a full, rather than a partial income replacement benefit. 2)The benefits were properly terminated pursuant to s129(1)(e) the first day of his full time employment in Alberta. However, from September 14/97 to the date of termination Sawkiw was entitled to be paid full income replacement benefit without adjustment for a partial return to work. Sawkiw was entitled to the difference and interest from the date such additional benefits should have been paid until the date of this judgment. 3)SGI was to arrange for an assessment by the rehabilitation centre forthwith. If it is found that as a result of the accident Sawkiw is not able to hold the employment he held at the time of the accident, SGI is encouraged to consider his condition as a relapse under s142(1)(a). Under the terms of this judgment the final income replacement benefit will be other than one made pursuant to s139 or 140. 4)Sawkiw was entitled to his solicitor and client costs respecting services rendered and disbursements incurred from the date of filing his notice of motion to the date this judgment is received. He was also entitled to his costs associated with preparing and filing his notice of motion set at $600 being the maximum amount payable under the Personal Injury Benefits Regulations.","The respondent SGI terminated the plaintiff's income replacement benefits pursuant to s.185 of the Automobile Accident Insurance Act. The plaintiff had been injured in a motor vehicle accident and received a partial income replacement benefit from SGI on the basis that he was not able to perform some but not all of his farm duties. After the accident, the plaintiff temporarily disabled himself and underwent physiotherapy at a physiotherapy clinic in Yorkton. He applied to SGI for an order setting aside the termination of benefits. HELD: SGI's termination was appropriate because the plaintiff was not available for recommended treatment, did not follow or participate in rehabilitation program or neglected or refused to undergo an examination.  1)SGI's failure to make a suitable rehabilitation program available to the plaintiff prior to and after the accident was a significant factor.  2)Section 129(1)(e) of the Act provides benefits to victims of motor vehicle accidents. SGI shall pay the plaintiff the difference, if any, between the amount paid to him for the period September 24 to October 23, 1997 and the amount required to be paid pursuant to the judgment for the commencement date of his employment in Alberta. 3)The plaintiff was entitled to interest on such a date as was appropriate."
5_2000canlii3680.txt,"After being sexually assaulted, applicant was voluntarily released from Canadian Armed Forces. She applied for and was denied a pension. Civil proceedings were commenced and the Crown defended on the basis that before initiating civil proceedings, applicant was obliged to appeal denial of pension or seek review by Minister of pension rejection. Applicant applied to strike out that portion of defence application allowed. The applicant applied for and was denied a pension. Therefore no pension was at this time payable to her. A review by the Minister would require new information and the appeal period had expired. The applicant should not be denied her right to proceed against the Crown in such circumstances.","The plaintiff was a member of the Canadian Armed Forces. She was voluntarily released from the military and did not make an application for a pension. In October 1996, DND, without the plaintiff's involvement, re-assessed her release from the Military and ruled that she should have been released on medical grounds, being disabled and not being able to perform the duties of her trade or employment. The Crown brought an application to strike the statement of claim on the basis it disclosed no reasonable cause of action. The plaintiff brought an action for damages against the government claiming that under s. 4(1) of the Crown Liability and Proceedings Act no action lies against the Crown where a pension is being paid or is 'payable' until the individual accepts the Minister's denial but believes for reasons unrelated to the pension application they are entitled to relief or remedy; review requires new information, which presumably would require the plaintiff to pursue meaningless appeals simply to meet the conditions of s. and s. 111. On the admitted facts of this case, the Crown could not meet that onus because the plaintiff had never made an application.  It was inconceivable that having been denied the application for pension by the government for sexual assault the plaintiff is precluded from bringing this proceeding because she failed to appeal in time. To interpret the section as imposing an obligation on the employee to apply for pension, and further obligation upon him to prove that pension is not payable, would require us to read into the legislation concepts which are both unexpressed and unreasonable."
5_2001skqb463.txt,"This judgment applies to both QBG No. 1040/98 and QBG No. 1041/98 respecting the contract between the city and Triple P Holdings and the January 21, 1997 contract between the plaintiffs and the defendants. The first breach of contract concerned a failure to apply the rotation of truckers described in the arrangement between the city and Truckers Association. The second breach alleged the defendants took too many hours on the total contract. Both matters were tried together. The defendants pleaded there was no privity of contract between the city and plaintiffs, therefore the plaintiffs could not enforce terms agreed to by the city and Triple P. HELD: Both actions were dismissed. 1)The case did not turn on the issue of privity. While the plaintiffs were not actual parties to the contract with the city, certain benefits were intended to pass through the general contract to members of the Truckers Association. 2)There was no contractual obligation in the 1997 agreement which required the defendant to adhere to any particular arrangement on the rotation of work. The contract between the defendants and city was not incorporated by specific or general reference. The first sentence of s.9 of the 1997 tender for rental of truck specifications was more consistent with what was actually done by the defendants than with the interpretation put on it by the plaintiffs. They failed to make out a case that the contract term was as alleged or that any breach occurred.  3)Had a case been made out, further evidence of damages would be required. The damages claimed were excessive and did not properly take into account actual operating expenses, the net affect of mitigating factors, and reliable calculation of the administration of the rotation of work.","The two contracts that play in this case are the contract between the City of Regina and Triple P Holdings operated by the defendants and the same two defendants. While the plaintiffs were not actual parties to the contract, the general thrust of all of the evidence was that certain benefits were intended to pass through the general contract to the members of the Independent Truckers Association. The plaintiffs failed to make out a case that the contract term was as alleged on that breach and that any breach occurred. HELD: Each case was dismissed. 1)The plaintiffs have constructed their cases in reliance upon the overall affect of both contracts with specific emphasis on the contract of January 21, 1997. The factual evidence is in conflict but find that the defendants made some effort to include the plaintiffs in the rotation. Problematically, for the plaintiffs, there is no contractual obligation in the agreement of January 20, 1997 which requires the defendants to adhere to any particular arrangement on the rotation of work. The contract goes on to specify the contractors obligations to pay in the event of a breach.  2)The issue of privity of contract could have been a critical issue in different circumstances but in the end this case will not turn on the question of privitity. 3)Once the plaintiffs had constructed their case, they would have had to draw in all the parties, including the trucking association and the city of Regina as well as all the related documents."

His common law spouse died suddenly in 1997 and he has remained the sole care and support for their mentally handicapped child. He appealed the dismissal of his application in March 2000 to vary the support order by suspending payment until he gained employment and by reducing arrears. HELD: The appeal was allowed in part. He must obtain employment when his health allows. Arrears were reduced to $5,000 and enforcement was stayed so long as he continues to make monthly payments of $30 to Maintenance Enforcement.","The parties divorced in 1992 and the appellant was ordered to pay $200 monthly support. The parties later entered into a new relationship and he and his common-law spouse had a mentally handicapped child born in 1995. In 1996, he was laid off from his employment and he remained at home to care for the child. In 1997, his common law spouse died suddenly and he was the sole care and supportee. He used her modest insurance proceeds for living expenses and he made no payment towards the accumulated arrears of support. In March 2000, he made an application to vary the support order both by suspending payment until he gained employment and by reducing the arreaars. The application was dismissed without reasons.

5_2003skpc19.txt,At issue in the negligence suit was whether the defendant ought to have seen the plaintiff's vehicle in front of him and stopped his vehicle to avoid the motor vehicle collision. The only material difference in testimonies was whether there was a half-ton truck in front of the plaintiff's vehicle when the collision occurred. HELD: The plaintiff's claim was not proven on a balance of probabilities. The physical evidence did not assist and the court was unable to conclude that one version was correct and the other incorrect.,"An action in negligence arising out of a vehicle accident. A tractor-trailer slowly inched up to a car driven by the plaintiff and nudged it causing damage to the back bumper, a slight denting on the trunk lid and some damage to tractor unit. The ultimate disagreement was over the issue of whether the defendant ought to have seen the plaintiff's vehicle in front of him and therefore, stopped his vehicle thus avoiding the collision. HELD: The plaintiff's claim was dismissed without costs to either party. The physical evidence did not support either version of the facts put forth by the parties.  1)The scales of justice were evenly balanced and the evidence was, at the end of the day, equivocal. The scales were not weighing persuasively in favour of either the plaintiff or defendant based upon the oral evidence given by the witnesses at the trial. Each version contains an equally rational explanation for what transpired.  2)The physical evidence was not dispositive of either side of the issue. The testimony of the plaintiff, the defendant and his wife concerning the circumstances at the scene of the accident were all believable. Each witness to the actual occurrence actually believed that what they were relating was true and correct version of facts as they perceived them to have transpired. 3)The plaintiff was not satisfied on a balance of probabilities that his claim had been proven."
5_2004skca60.txt,"The applicant applies for leave to appeal a decision of the Assessment Appeals Committee of the Saskatchewan Municipal Board on a question of law pursuant to s. 33.1 of the Municipal Board Act. The issues raised by the applicant relate to abnormal obsolescence for size and the refusal of the Assessor to apply abnormal obsolescence to the owner's property. The issues also relate to 15 other properties and as the issues are the same for each property they were decided by the Assessment Appeals Committee on one appeal. The Assessment Appeals Committee dismissed the appeals, finding the issue not to be a matter of the Assessor's Discretion but a matter of professional interpretation of data. The Committee found the Board of Revision did not err in its decision to dismiss the appeals and found the Board did not err on the issue of abnormal obsolescence for size. HELD: Leave to appeal was granted on two questions of law.  1) Did the Committee err in its interpretation and application of the Saskatchewan Assessment Manual by failing to find that economic obsolescence for size must be categorized on a MAF by MAF basis? 2) Did the Committee err by failing to find the Assessor should have used the comparable unit method to determine whether an adjustment for obsolescence for size should be applied to the applicant's property? 3) On the use of invalid sales leave was denied on the basis the question of the sale is a question of fact and in argument the applicant said for its purposes the impugned sale did not matter. 4) Leave to appeal was denied on the issue of the standard of proof that there was no error demonstrated.","The applicant applies for leave to appeal a decision of the Assessment Appeals Committee of the Saskatchewan Municipal Board on a question of law pursuant to s. 33.1 of The Municipal Board Act. HELD: Leave to appeal is denied. The issue is the use of invalid sales and the alleged improper onus or standard of proof. The sale was impugned and the question of the sale did not matter. The Assessor determined the specific MAF neighbourhoods based on industrial property sales. However, in determining the existence of abnormal obsolescence for size the Assessor worked on the basis of aggregated sales from different Maf neighbourhoods. The Committee did not view the matter as one of assessor discretion but saw it as a matter of professional interpretation of data. At the outset the door may still be opened but the key to opening it is a demonstrable case of concrete and material failure, particularly as it may relate to the general, though not necessarily so confined. The key certainly does not lie in speculative, abstract, or harmless failures of process related to the particular. The onus of establishing the ground is on the appellant."
5_2005skqb538.txt,"FIAT: The applicant defendant seeks an order pursuant to s. 10 of The Attachment of Debts Act setting aside the plaintiff's pre-judgment garnishees in which $2,291.90 was paid into court from the defendant's bank account in December 2005. The issue is whether the plaintiff's claim is a liquidated demand within the meaning of s. 3(1) of the Act, and if so, whether the affidavit filed in support of the issuance of both of the pre-judgment garnishees complies with s. 3(2) of the Act. HELD: The plaintiff has not strictly complied with the provisions of s. 3(2) of the Act, and the garnishee summons are a nullity.  1) In an application to set aside a pre-judgment garnishee, the court is not to consider potential defences to the action or the existence of triable issues as grounds for setting aside a garnishee summons. 2) The court examined whether or not the affidavit showed, with the required precision, the amount of the debt or liquidated demand. Although there is reference in the statement of claim to an agreement that interest would be paid at 2.0 % per month, compounded monthly, there is no mention of interest in the Operating Agreement. 3) Of more concern is the four-page invoice attached to the affidavit supposedly attached to confirm the amount of the debt owed by the defendant. The invoice is vague and is of no assistance to the court in clarifying the precise amount of the debt owing. Unlike the information provided in the affidavit of Kuznitsoff v. Hilltop Ford Equipment Sales Ltd. (c.o.b. Hilltop Equipment Sales), wherein the affidavit charted the alleged gross profits by listing the equipment, date of sale, model number, sale price, cost and gross profits on a line by line basis, the contents of the affidavit here is severely deficient in showing with precision the amount of indebtedness owing.","FIAT: The applicant seeks an order pursuant to s. 10 of The Attachment of Debts Act setting aside the plaintiff's pre-judgment garnishee in which $2,291.90 was paid into Court from the defendant's bank account at Biggar and District Credit Union on December 7, 2005. The issue is whether the claim is a liquidated demand within the meaning of s. 3(1) of the Act and if so, whether the affidavit of the plaintiff filed in support of the issuance of both the sufficiency and quantity of the debt garnishees. HELD: 1) The plaintiff's claim discloses a prima facie claim for debt or liquidated damage pursuant to the 3(3) Act and that the affidavit'shows with precision the amount of the indebtedness owing on the judgment, the debt or the liquidation demand as the case may be'.  2) The Court had not considered any of the contents of the affidavit filed by the applicant or the statement of defence and counterclaim. The reason for that is important. In an application to set aside prejudgment guishee, the Court is not to consider potential defences to the action or the existence of triable issues as grounds for grounds for setting aside garnihee summons. Phoenix Rotary Equipment Ltd. v. Denis, 2004 SKQB 129 (CanLII), cited in Conexus, the purposes of the various constituent subsections of the s.3(2)(s.of the Act for making its decision. 3) It is trite law that a plaintiff has a statutory right to garnish the defendant’s funds before the validity of the claim has been determined if the action is for a debt or Liquidated demand. But pre- judgment garnishment is an extraordinary remedy and failure to strictly comply with the provisions of the act goes to jurisdiction. 4) The affidavit of a person filing an affidavit with the required precision is of no assistance to the Court in making the decision."
5_2006nsca41.txt,"The plaintiff company commenced an action against a former employee/shareholder for breach of fiduciary and employee duty. The shareholder defended and claimed that one of the directors had misappropriated funds from the company. The shareholder later retained a new solicitor, who successfully applied to amend the defence to withdraw certain admissions and amend the counterclaim to add a shareholder oppression remedy and for leave to bring a derivative action. The court found that, in the circumstances, the new counsel's assessment of his client's case was sufficient to allow the admissions in the defence to be withdrawn, the implied undertaking against the collateral use of discovery evidence did not apply because the pleaded material facts were the same facts material to the shareholder oppression action and the applicant bore an ordinary onus to establish the three statutory prerequisites. The court also directed the employee to retain an expert and for the company to pay that expert and make all reasonable disclosure that the expert reasonably required. The plaintiff company appealed. Appeal dismissed; there was evidence before the trial judge on which he could conclude that it was just that the admissions be withdrawn; with respect to the oppression remedies and the employee's status as a complainant, the wording of the earlier consent order could be interpreted as not suspending his rights as a former shareholder; there was a temporal connection between the impugned acts and his ownership of the shares and he had a sufficient interest in the oppression remedies. The terms the judge imposed were within the broad discretion conferred by the Third Schedule of the Companies Act and there was no breach of natural justice by the imposition of them.","The appellants sought an order permitting the defendant to withdraw his admissions and add a claim for an 'oppression remedy' pursuant to s. 5.03 of the Companies Act and leave to him to commence derivative action in the name of the company for alleged misdeeds of the defendants. The defendant had previously been a director at the company. He no longer worked for the company and the plaintiff sued him. At issue was whether the defendant's need to defend according to counsel's assessment of the facts was a strong reason for concluding it would be unjust to hold the defendants to the admissions in the defence drawn by former counsel. HELD: The defendant was granted leave to appeal. The appeal was dismissed. 1)A judicial admission should be allowed to be withdrawn if, in the circumstances, the court is satisfied it is in the interest of justice to withdraw same. 2)The defendant's admission and counterclaim were based on admissions made between 1985 and 1986 that were not made within the meaning of s. 7(5)(b) of the Act. The judge did not apply wrong principles or make an unjust order. The words of the consent order were that the defendant was only a shareholder from October 1985 to July 1986 and his rights as a former shareholder were suspended. 3)There were no equities weighing significantly against the justice of the request. The Barristers' Society had suspended the defendant in 2004 and the defendants retained new counsel who clearly had a different conception of the case and was turning to legislated causes in commercial law. 4)The court could not collaterally clothe every former shareholder and former director with the status of complainant for purposes of bringing a derivative action. The court could easily come to different conclusions on the accuracy of these averments."
5_2006nssc43.txt,"The plaintiff alleged that a small piece of metal seen dangling from beneath the defendant's tractor trailer flew out from under the trailer as it passed the plaintiff's vehicle and hit her engine hood, bounced in the open window and caused her to lose control of her vehicle. She suffered injuries to her hands, arm and shoulder as she brought her vehicle under control. The defendant applied for summary judgment, presenting expert's reports to show that the metal did not come from his vehicle, nor upon inspection was there any location from which it might have dangled. Application for summary judgment granted; the defendant met the threshold test and the plaintiff failed to adduce any evidence beyond a bare allegation that this claim had a chance of success. The plaintiff cannot resist a summary judgment application by simply asserting that there are matters of the plaintiff's credibility that can only be decided by a trial judge.","The plaintiff was driving from Halifax to Seabright when a tractor-trailer passed her vehicle. She alleged that a piece of metal fell off of his vehicle, fell to the pavement, bounced on to the engine bonnet of her vehicle, hit the left front fender near the aerial and then the wind blew it in through her open driver's side window. The defendant engaged two experts to examine the metal and reported that it did not come from the tractor trailer. The experts' reports showed no change in the thickness of the sheet or in the type of coating applied to it. The plaintiff argued that having established that her vehicle was well maintained and that the defendant's dust shield was painted, the respondent must then establish that his claim is one with real chance of success. HELD: The defendant had met the threshold test and the onus of proving the injuries were not entirely or solely arising through his negligence was shifted to the respondent. The expert reports did not show any connection between the alleged rate of speed and the mishap of the flying metal piece and therefore there was no issue to be tried.  1)It was now well established law that an applicant for summary judgment must meet a threshold test, establish that there is no genuine issue of material fact requiring trial and must present evidence which lends some support to the claims it advances. 2)Once the plaintiff has established that the claim in the tort of negligence can only succeed if she can show that (i) the defendant owed her duty of care, that he should have observed a standard of care in meeting his duty, (ii) that he failed to observe this standard, (iii) that his breach of duty caused the damage or injury to the plaintiff and (iv) that the damage is not too remote a consequence of a breach so as to render the defendant liable for its occurrence  and (v) there must be a real distinction or difference of evidence requiring the court to make a determination of credibility. 3)There was no evidence of the plaintiff's failure to maintain the vehicle, poor driving skills and lack of qualifications to drive a tractor trailer were all issues to be considered. The only way to show that there could not be a material fact in issue was if there was an agreement between the parties. 4)The expert reports filed by the respondent were summarily dismissed."
5_2006skpc2.txt,"The accused is charged with care or control of a motor vehicle while impaired contrary to s. 255(1) and s. 253(a) of the Criminal Code and care or control while over .08 contrary to s. 253(b) of the Code. HELD: There is no remedy of exclusion of the Certificate of Analysis. Accordingly, the accused is guilty of care or control while over .08. The evidence does not prove impairment beyond a reasonable doubt.  1) It is clear from the evidence that the accused's vehicle was inoperable and immovable due to the damage from the accident and its location in the ditch. The defence raised the issue of whether a person can be 'in care or control of a motor vehicle' when there is no risk that the vehicle in question can be put in motion so that it can become dangerous to the public. The Court reviewed the cases. The first person to come upon the accident scene found the accused alone in the vehicle seated in the driver's seat. He saw no visible signs of anyone else at the scene. Upon approaching the vehicle, he observed the accused turn the ignition key to try and start the vehicle. There was no other evidence which established that the 'accused did not occupy that seat for the purpose of setting the vehicle in motion'. The accused has failed to rebut the presumption of care or control under s. 258(1)(a) of the Code and the Court finds that the accused was in 'care or control' of the motor vehicle. 2) Considering the case law and after objectively considering all the indicial of impairment known to the officer, together with the circumstances of the accident itself (which indicate driving error) there can be no doubt the officer had more than reasonable and probable grounds to form the requisite opinion pursuant to s. 254(2) of the Code to make a demand for samples of analysis.  3) The officer was sensitive to the immediate concern of the physical well-being of the accused. Though he may have formed his opinion in the ambulance, he wisely waited until medical personnel had made an initial assessment at the hospital before making any kind of demand. In the circumstances, the Court finds the officer made the demand at the first practical opportunity in relation to the entire investigation. 3) The officer, in coming to his conclusion to make a blood sample demand, considered a number of relevant factors, including time limits to obtain a breath sample, the severity and magnitude of the accident, the potential seriousness of the accused's head and neck injuries, the need for immediate emergency assessment and length of time it would take to treat the accused and keep him under observation. He believed the accused's condition was potentially serious and was completely justified in holding that belief. The evidence has proven the accused required immediate and emergent medical attention which made it obviously impractical to put the accused before a breathalyzer instrument within the time limit fixed by the Code. The officer had reasonable and probable grounds to believe that by reason of his physical condition, the accused may be incapable of providing a sample of his breath, or it would be impracticable to obtain a sample of his breath. All the requirements of s. 254(3) of the Code have been proven beyond a reasonable doubt. 4) The evidence discloses that the police officer made numerous efforts to ensure the accused actually spoke to a lawyer in private. After that, the accused made no further requests whatsoever to further speak to a lawyer. Following the principles set forth by the Saskatchewan Court of Appeal in R. v. Leedahl, 2002 SKCA 5, the evidence clearly establishes the accused was coherent and understood the right to counsel enunciated to him by the police officer. He in fact spoke to a lawyer and made no other requests. Further, there was no suggestion that the accused was incapable of understanding his right to counsel or that he was incapable or prevented from acting on his right. To the contrary, the evidence proves the exact opposite. The Court finds the accused has failed to demonstrate his s. 10(b) right to counsel was denied or infringed in any way.","The accused was charged with two counts of impaired driving and one count of having consumed alcohol in such a quantity that his blood alcohol content exceeded.08 contrary to s.255(1) and s.253(a) of the Criminal Code. The accused was found to be in care or control of the vehicle at the time of the accident. The Court reviewed the principles set out in R. v. Leedahl and reviewed Schnell's dominant or controlling purpose during the critical overlap period and found that the accused had not rebutted the presumption in s.258(1)(a). Since the vehicle was inoperable as a result of an accident, with no risk of setting in motion a demand for samples of analysis, and because the accused was in the driver's seat with his seat belt on, the officer had reasonable and probable grounds to believe the accused may be incapable of providing a sample of his breath or it would be impracticable to obtain one. All of the requirements of s. 254(3) had been proven beyond a reasonable doubt."
5_2008nssc113.txt,"The mother of two boys, ages 12 and 13, applied to vary access to add a condition that the father only be allowed to drive with the boys in the HRM, on roads with a speed limit of 80km/hr and under. She asked the Court to continue conditions that prevented him from consuming marijuana less than 8 hours before driving, and required him to consider the boys' wishes regarding access and transportation. The father argued that all restrictions relating to the transport of the children should be removed. The father had MS, and a medical marijuana licence. His driving was evaluated yearly, and the report arising from the latest evaluation did not appear to address his marijuana use. An independent assessment of the children's wishes showed they enjoyed time with their father, but worried about his ability to drive under the influence of marijuana. The unrepresented mother sought costs. Conditions continued; variation granted. If he leaves the HRM, the father is to arrange for public or other transportation. Costs awarded to the mother in the amount of $800. In terms of the driving issue, it was not fair to place the entire burden of the transport issue on the children. The Court was not satisfied from the evidence that the father's marijuana use was benign, and there was also a concern about the symptoms of his MS, especially on long trips. While in the HRM, if the boys became concerned about driving with their father, they could take a bus home or call their mother. If outside of the HRM, it would be more difficult for them to get home. In terms of costs issue, the mother was the successful party. Although she was unrepresented, she did have to take considerable time off work. She was also inconvenienced because the father was late in filing documents, despite having been given clear time-lines by the Court.","The father applied for a change to the Corollary Relief Judgment, alleging that the mother had failed to provide adequate access and communication with his four children. The father had been denied access with his children for multiple sclerosis. He sought to have the restrictions on his use of marijuana continue in effect; an assessment of the children's health and their wishes in respect to access with their father was ordered. The mother opposed the application and requested that the matter be set aside for a further organizational pretrial to be held in November. HELD: The court found that the father’s medical condition and its possible effect on his ability to drive were not factors to be determined. The evidence did not support his contention that marijuana use was a risk to his children. It was more likely that his children would suffer the consequences of his marijuana use if the drive were lengthy. The court awarded a cost award to the father."
5_2008skca56.txt,"The accused was convicted by a jury of sexual assault and assault with a weapon. He was sentenced to 2 years in a federal penitentiary plus 2 years probation. He appeals both conviction and sentence. The accused and complainant met in a bar for the first time and then went to the accused's apartment. The complainant is a sex trade worker and was of the view that the accused was prepared to pay for sex. The accused stated that he did not know the complainant was a prostitute and thought she had 'picked him up'. Upon arriving at the appellant's home, he refused to pay for sex and the complainant refused consensual sex, at which point the appellant forced himself upon her, forcibly restrained her, removed her clothing and touched her body in a sexual manner, choked her and struck her in the face. As she tried to escape, the appellant struck her three times in the back with a baseball bat. The appellant argues there were two problems with the jury charge: 1) that the trial judge should have addressed the jury further with respect to the various types of inconsistencies and contradictions in the complainant's testimony and explained their significance, and 2) the trial judge should have mentioned a number of additional inconsistencies. HELD: Appeal against conviction dismissed. The issues with the jury charge do not give rise to intervention by this Court. While there is a general obligation on the trial judge to instruct the jury by reviewing the evidence and addressing inconsistencies, how the obligation is fulfilled will vary from case to case. There is no absolute formula automatically giving rise to a new trial. Much depends on the context of the whole trial and such things as the nature of the inconsistency and whether it goes to the essence of an element of the offence. The trial judge's charge was entirely correct in the circumstances of this case. Appeal against sentence is allowed and a sentence of 2 years less 1 day is substituted. The sentence imposed by the trial judge was based on a consensus between the crown and defence counsels. Both were of the view that a sentence in the federal system was more appropriate since it would permit the appellant to access sex offender treatment. After sentencing, the appellant, who is an immigrant, was informed that with a sentence of 2 years, he would have no appeal against an order declaring him inadmissible to Canada. If a sentence of less than 2 years is imposed, he will be guaranteed the opportunity to appear personally or by counsel on his appeal of such an order. The jurisprudence supports the proposition that a sentence's unintended effect on immigration status can be a relevant factor on sentence appeal.","The appellant appealed his conviction for sexual assault and using a weapon contrary to s. 271 of the Criminal Code and s. 267(a) of the Code. He was tried by a jury, which convicted him.  He was sentenced to two years in a federal penitentiary plus two years probation. He appeals both his conviction and sentence. HELD: The appeal against conviction is dismissed. 1) When one assesses the case through the lens of the Yebes test of reasonableness, conclude that the verdict is not unreasonable. 2) The appellant's evidence is entirely correct to the circumstances of this case. The trial judge stressed the reasonable doubt standard and he concluded his charge with the direction consistent with R. v. W.(D.).  3) The charge in this case meets the standard of being properly instructed. The fact that the appellant was informed by the Canada Border Services Agency that with a sentence of two years or more, he would have no appeal against an order declaring him inadmissible to Canada. Apparently, if the sentence of 2 years less a day is imposed, the appellant will be guaranteed the opportunity of appearing personally or having legal counsel represent him on his appeal of such an order."

He had a previous record for non-violent offences., defendant sentenced to nine-and-a-half years imprisonment; aggravating factors included the defendant's possession and use of a handgun in an area where a number of people were close by and that a bullet had found its way into a nearby residence.","The two accused were jointly charged with two counts of murder and one count of attempted murder in relation to shootings in the early morning hours of December 10, 2006. Following a preliminary inquiry, both accused were committed to stand trial on April 4, 2008. Both remained in custody until October 29, 2008 when they were released on judicial interim release under the Adult Bail Supervision Program. In this case, the accused served approximately 17 months of pre-trial custody while on remand and he should be credited 34 months for this dead time. HELD: The sentence is one of years incarceration. The court must consider the nature and circumstances of the offence and the character of the accused in order to arrive at a fit and proper sentence.  1) An aggravating factor is that handguns were used in an area where a number of people were close by at the after hours bar known as Vegas. Quite few shots were fired and two persons died as result of the gunfire. 2) A sentence of 9 years should be imposed with a credit on a 2 for 1 basis for the accused's pre- trial custody and a credit for time spent on post-trial release. 3) The sentences must reflect society's abhorrence of those who decide to live by the gun and use the gun to settle disputes. The principles of sentencing are set out in s.718 to 718.2 of the Criminal Code. The fundamental purpose of sentencing is to contribute to respect for the law and the maintenance of a just, peaceful and safe society. The offence was particularly serious because the accused had a prior criminal record for non-violent offences such as fraud, possession of a controlled substance and careless storage of a weapon. The risk posed by such shootings to law-abiding citizens who are going about their daily business is high and increasing. The accused must be put on notice that there will be severe consequences for those who behave in such fashion."
5_2011nsca46.txt,"The defendant, who was found guilty of the careless use of a firearm, possession of a weapon for a purpose dangerous to the public peace and possession of a restricted or prohibited firearm applied for bail pending appeal. He had been found, in his residence, with a firearm licensed in Alberta but not licensed to be brought into this province or possessed here. The defendant had residences in both Alberta and Nova Scotia but his Halifax residence was now up for sale and he travelled extensively around the world for his work. Although he had no criminal record and had been on a recognizance for 16 months prior to sentencing, the Crown argued that he was a flight risk given that his convictions would result in a mandatory three-year prison term and he had only a tenuous connection to the jurisdiction. Application for bail pending appeal granted provided the defendant enter into a recognizance of $25,000 with conditions. The defendant's actions bore no resemblance to the known problem of indiscriminate firearm use locally as he was a middle-aged professional and gun hobbyist and the circumstances that purportedly made him a flight risk had nothing to do with these charges but rather with his professional obligations.","The appellant appeals his convictions for careless use of a firearm and unlawful possession of a weapon. He alleges the trial judge erred in failing to find a breach of the Charter when the police entered the appellant’s condominium and failed to grant remedy as well as in finding that it was unreasonable for the appellant to take a loaded handgun to the door in all the circumstances. He also alleges the minimum sentence provisions of s. 95(1) are unconstitutional. HELD: The appellant is released on terms set out in R. v. Renacci. The grounds of appeal are weak and must be balanced in the public interest. 1) The appellant has no criminal record, substantial assets, a favourable pre-sentence report and has been on bail for 16 months without incident. The Crown cites the seriousness of the charges, drug abuse and the drug trade generally heighten public interest and perception where drug trafficking is concerned. 2) There is no evidence that the appellant poses a flight risk. If everyone using firearms in furtherance of other illegal activities in the community would be advised to surrender their firearms and ammunition, the accused would be released on an undertaking to appear within 24 hours of the filing with the Registrar of the Court the order dismissing or quashing the appeal or the notice of abandonment of the appeal, as the case may be. The circumstances that the Crown suggest make the appellant a 'flight risk' have nothing to do with the charges he has faced or the convictions that have resulted. Rather, they result from his professional obligations. The terms of his proposed release are totally inadequate and do nothing to bind his conscience."
5_2011skca26.txt,"The appellant appealed his conviction for dangerous driving and alleged that his estranged wife and daughter lied. The appellant had been represented at trial by experienced counsel but undertook the appeals himself. HELD: Appeal dismissed. The appellant had not followed procedures that must be followed if one intends, on appeal, to challenge the competence of trial counsel or to adduce fresh evidence.","The appellant appealed his conviction for dangerous driving to the Court of Queen's Bench and, having failed, then appealed to this Court. He was convicted at trial on the basis of the testimony of his estranged wife and their daughter, whose accounts of what occurred were accepted by the trial judge. The trial judge found both to be credible witnesses. He also rejected the appellant's account, finding that he was not a credible witness. The appellant took the appeals himself and argued that there were procedures that had to be followed if one intends, on appeal, to challenge the competence of trial counsel or to adduce fresh evidence. HELD: The appeal was dismissed.  1)There was no tenable basis for allowing his appeal, setting aside his conviction, and ordering a new trial. On the facts, based on the judge's assessments of credibility, the conduct of the accused amounted to dangerous driving within the meaning of the applicable provisions of the Criminal Code.  2)The Court of Appeal had no choice but to allow the appeal on the facts and to add that the Court had nothing before it upon which it might act upon allegations of that nature. There were no precedents for the Court to act upon such an application. 3)The appellant had little to say in the Court upon appeal except that he had evidence to prove his wife's perjury and that she was out to get him and had intimidated their daughter."
5_2013skpc45.txt,"The plaintiff entered into a contract with the defendant for the installation and monitoring of temperature monitoring equipment for its meat cutting business. The defendant monitored the temperature in the freezer and cooler at the business. The plaintiffs sued because their freezer failed and meat spoiled after a circuit breaker at the business tripped off. The defendant had received no alarm. The plaintiff asserts that the defendant breached the contract by failing to properly monitor the temperature in the freezer. HELD: The contract between the parties was solely for installation and monitoring. The contract did not include any obligation on the defendant to maintain or repair the equipment at the plaintiff's business. The Court was satisfied that the defendant was monitoring the signal from the plaintiff's business on the dates in question and no alarm was received. It is not possible to say with any certainty why the defendant did not receive an alarm, but the Court was not satisfied that the plaintiff was regularly having its monitoring equipment serviced or repaired. The plaintiff has not proven that the defendant breached the contract. The action is dismissed.","In 2006, Sturgis Meats entered into a contract with Gardon Securities. That contract covered both the installation of temperature monitoring equipment at the company and the month to month monitoring by the company of the temperature in the freezer and cooler at the business thereafter. The contract also provided that the defendant would not be responsible for any delay or interruption of service due to any acts of god or cause beyond the control of Gardon. Even with this dispute, the monitoring was done by the defendant staff in Yorkton, based on information transmitted by the monitoring equipment over a telephone line from the business. HELD: The action was dismissed. Based on the original contract between the parties and ongoing payments being made in 2010 by the business, it is not possible on the evidence to say with any certainty why Gardon did not receive such an alarm generated by the rising of the freezer temperature at the plaintiff. It is possible that there was a so-called glitch in the company's computer monitoring equipment. There is not in the view of that standard that the reason Gardon failed not receive a freezer temperature alarm from the plaintiff was within their control. The plaintiff was awarded costs of the action."

The respondent’s solicitors filed the certificate of pending litigation after his death. The appellant transferred the land subject to the certificate of pending litigation into her name only and entered into an agreement to sell the land, which could not proceed with the certificate of pending litigation. HELD: The appeal was of sufficient merit and it was not prima facie frivolous or vexatious. The appeal, however, was not found to be of sufficient importance to the practice of law or the Court of Queen’s Bench to warrant determination by the Court of Appeal. There was no new, controversial or unusual issue of practice raised by the appeal. The issues were determined to be better left for resolution by the Court of Queen’s Bench after hearing vive voce evidence at trial.","The applicant sought to appeal from a chambers judge's decision not to vacate a certificate of pending litigation registered on behalf of her estranged husband, who was deceased and his estate was represented by his executors. The applicant did not consider whether the order appealed from was interlocutory or final in nature and subsequently filed a notice of appeal seeking leave to appeal. HELD: The application for leave was dismissed.  1)The proposed appeal did not raise a new or controversial or unusual issue of practice, nor does it raise new or uncertain or unsettled point of law. However, the proposed appeal may raise a valid question of law based on the facts of this matter, it does not bear heavily or potentially prejudiced the prospective outcome of the action. 2)It is not pertinent to the proceedings before the Court of Queen's Bench or to the field of practice or the state of the law to warrant determination by a panel of this Court."
6_1990canlii4137.txt,"This was an application under the Charter of Rights and Freedoms for an order declaring that the mandatory retirement of the two appellant university professors was invalid and denied the rights of the appellants as guaranteed under ss. 15(1) and (7) of the Charter, and an order for reinstatement and back pay. Dismissing the application, that (1) pursuant to s. 32 of the Charter, the Charter did not apply to these employees since the university was not a subordinate body of government, and was not being controlled by government, but was an independent institution; the fact that the university's governing statute provided that teaching staff were 'deemed to be persons employed in the public service of the Province' for the purposes of their pension plan did not constitute governmental control such as to warrant the application of the Charter; and (2) the proper forum for this application was the Human Rights Commission. The court also considered the retroactive effect of the Nova Scotia decision in Sniders v. Nova Scotia (Attorney General), which struck down the provision in the Nova Scotia Human Rights Act precluding anyone 65 years or over from making an age discrimination complaint. The court concluded that the Sniders decision did have a retroactive effect to the date when s. 15 of the Charter came into force.","This was an application under s. 15(1), 24(1) and 52 of the Charter of Rights for an order declaring that the mandatory retirement of the applicants by the respondent was invalid and that they be reinstated as full time members of the faculty of the respondent immediately and that the respondent pay all compensation due to them as employees since the date of their mandatory retirement plus interest, and costs of the proceeding. Allowing the application on the grounds that the order infringed the applicants' rights and was inconsistent with their rights as guaranteed under the Charter, and that, in the area of private discrimination, an entirely new system of civil liability in competition with the dispute resolution mechanisms fostered by human rights legislation would result."
6_1994canlii3963.txt,"The respondents were charged with possession for the purposes of trafficking and cultivation of marijuana, contrary to s. 4(2) and 6(2) of the Narcotic Control Act. RCMP had investigated a tip that a large crop of marijuana plants was being grown on a private property located in a clearing off a woods road. They did not have a search warrant to enter the property, and arrested the respondents after observing them care for the plants. At trial, the court held their right to be secure from unreasonable search and seizure had been violated, and acquitted them. The Crown appealed the acquittal. Per Roscoe, J.A., Chipman, J.A. concurring, allowing the appeal and ordering a new trial, that there was no s. 8 breach because the respondents did not have a reasonable expectation of privacy in the field where the marijuana crop was growing. The court reviewed case law regarding 'open fields', and 'uncultivated' lands, and adopted the reasoning in Oliver v. United States, 104 S.Ct.1735(1984) in reaching its conclusion. Per Pugsley, J.A., dissenting, dismissing the appeal, that the respondents had a reasonable expectation of privacy in activities carried on by them on their private property. As there were no exigent circumstances, the search was not reasonable and the evidence should be excluded.","The respondents were charged with possession for the purposes of trafficking and cultivation of marijuana. The voir dire was held to determine the admissibility of evidence obtained by the police as a result of the seizure of 100 marijuana plants. The trial judge found that the police did not have reasonable grounds for their belief that the property searched contained narcotics, that they only had a mere suspicion, and that the warrantless search violated their s. 8 Charter rights. The respondents appealed. Allowing the appeal and ordering a new trial, that the trial judge erred in concluding that the evidence was not admissible. The appeal should be allowed and the new trial ordered."
6_1996canlii6791.txt,"Allegations by the former wife and a child and family counsellor that the father and his new wife had physically and sexually abused the two children were found by authorities to be baseless. The co-defendants, the mother and counsellor, protested that they were under a duty to report the disclosures of abuse. At issue was whether the publication of four reports was libellous thus causing damage to the plaintiffs' reputations, whether they conspired to libel them in order to obtain custody, and whether the counsellor was incompetent and unqualified to assess and counsel the children and negligent in the preparation of the reports. HELD: Judgment was awarded against the defendants jointly and severally in the amount of $27,000. Aggravated damages of $1,000 was awarded against the mother and $15,000 was awarded against the counsellor and her company.  1)To prove that each defendant published written defamatory statements likely to injure their reputations, three presumptions must be made: the statements were published maliciously (malice in law); the statements were false; and the plaintiffs suffered damages. 2)Every publication of a defamatory statement is a new publication. It is no defence that the mother merely distributed the counsellor's reports. 3)Counsel conceded that the allegations in three of the reports, on their face, were defamatory.  4)The mother enjoyed qualified privilege prima facie because parental duty is so compelling. Two reports containing untrue and degrading allegations were in themselves intrinsic evidence of malice. The long history of the mother's attempts to discredit the plaintiffs was extrinsic evidence of impure motive or malice. The taping of the phone calls was considered to be just another trick to try and advance her cause. 5)The counsellor's reports tendered in court enjoyed absolute privilege but that privilege was lost when she published them to various social workers, the police and the doctors. This is true whether the reports were of an ordinary or expert witness. 6)Both criteria, making a report maliciously and without reasonable grounds, must be satisfied before an action will lie pursuant to s.12 of the Child and Family Services Act. Three reports were slanderous. 7)The conspiracy claim was dismissed. 8)The counsellor had extensive educational background but no clinical training in counselling or interviewing children and 45 sessions were excessive. 9)The counsellor owed a fiduciary duty to the children as their counsellor but owed no corresponding duty to their parents. The negligence claim was dismissed. 10)The long-lasting mental distress of the plaintiffs was clear and they were entitled to aggravated damages. They were not awarded punitive damages as there was no need of further deterrence.","The parties, both medical professionals, claimed that the mother of two boys, his ex-wife and child and family counsellor, had wrongfully accused them of physically and sexually abusing them. The allegations appeared in four reports prepared by the mother for the family court, social services, the police and other persons. HELD: 1)The mother's justification plea was withdrawn.  2)The evidence showed that the statements were made with express malice, which can be proven by extrinsic or intrinsic evidence. 3)The Court dismissed the application to vary the custodial arrangements. It held that if the defendant had a reasonable doubt as to the extent to which his allegations were based upon actual malice, he should not have taken the position that his children were victims of physical and sexual abuse. 4)The co-defendants brought an action to libel the plaintiffs and wrest custody from the father. 5)Costs were set aside in family court chambers."

He sought a declaration that a member of the police service must be informed of any investigation of his conduct prior to the commencement of the investigation as required by s.54 of the Police Act.; the Act does not permit the amendment in Form A discipline notice since it is a statutory form. The relief sought regarding disclosure had been abandoned by the applicant. The applicant argued that the fundamental questions to be addressed revolved around issues of statutory interpretation that must be resolved on a standard of correctness and the alternative remedies were not adequate. The respondent took the position that this Court should not entertain the application as there is a convenient alternative remedy provided in the Act by way of appeal to the provincial Police Commission; that the Chief was entitled to amend the notice and would be entitled to grant leave if required; the hearing officer erred in holding that s.54(1) of the Act requires notice of an internal investigation to be provided to the subject member. HELD: The application was dismissed. There is an adequate alternative remedy which should be pursued. There were no 'special circumstances' upon which the court should exercise its discretion to determine the merits of the application.","The applicant sought an order in the nature of prohibition to prevent the respondent hearing officer, in his capacity as Hearing Officer under The Police Act, from proceeding with the hearing into the conduct of the applicant pursuant to discipline charges brought against him by the respondent police chief. HELD: 1) The applicant was a member of the Regina Police Service. Pursuant to the Act the applicant was charged with discreditable conduct. He was served with the Notice of Formal Discipline Proceedings in Form under the Act on October 28, 1998. He received no notice of the investigation pursuant to s. 54(1) of the Act. The hearing officer held that the existence of an adequate alternative remedy was held to constitute a bar because judicial review is a discretionary remedy and if an adequate remedy was available, it ought to be accessed. 2) The respondent argued the Court should decline to hear judicial review applications of interim decisions in discipline hearings. The issues to be addressed were the procedure on the appeal, the composition of the senate committee, its powers and manner in which they were exercised, the burden of previous finding, expeditiousness and costs. 3) There was insufficient evidence to conclude that the applicant's right to fair hearing was affected by the failure by the Chief of the Police to provide the required statutory notice. Further, there was insufficient time and money to exercise the appropriate remedy."
6_2000skqb355.txt,"FIAT. The applicants, charged separately, plead not guilty to cultivation and possession of marijuana and sought to have the evidence obtained pursuant to the authorizations for electronic surveillance and search warrant be excluded from trial and requested a stay of proceedings on all charges.  They argued the search warrant, which resulted in the seizure of 365 marijuana plants, should be set aside on the additional grounds police officers allowed two news media camera crews onto the premises to film during the course of the search thereby rendering the search unreasonable pursuant to s.8 of the Charter. The primary ground was that the police did not try any available investigative procedures before applying for a surveillance authorization. As the matter was not urgent s.186(1)(b) of the Criminal Code was not complied with. The Crown objected to the defences' reliance on portions of the preliminary inquiry. The Crown produced an edited copy of the affidavits in support of the electronic and video surveillance warrants wherein all dates and other information were deleted to protect the identity of a principal source of information. HELD: The application for a stay of proceedings was dismissed. The evidence obtained pursuant to the electronic surveillance and the video surveillance warrant were ruled inadmissible at trial. The search warrant respecting the residence was set aside. The seriousness of the charge combined with the real evidence of the 365 marijuana plants outweighed the breach of the Charter s.8 right to be secure from unreasonable search and seizure. The exclusion of the evidence obtained from the search of the premises would bring the administration of justice into disrepute. 1)The portions of the preliminary inquiry transcript were allowed by way of affidavit subject to the right of the Crown to call amplification evidence.  2)The affidavit in support of the authorizations were considered solely on the basis of the edited copies. 3)The affidavit did disclose a current offence. It was not obvious why the Crown edited out the dates. 4)The 1997 authorization was set aside. The search was unreasonable and in breach of s.8 of the Charter. The s.186(1)(b) pre-conditions for granting an authorization were not met. There was no information contained in the affidavit or the amplification evidence which could support an objective standard that other investigative procedures were unlikely to succeed. The impression given the issuing judge was false and misleading. The fact pattern was the reverse of that in Dosch. The information was limited to the existence of a marijuana grow operation on a rural acreage owned by Derksen with whom Begrand-Fast was alleged to be involved. Neither had a criminal record. The boilerplate paragraphs as to why other investigative procedures were unlikely to succeed had no factual basis.  5)The information submitted to establish reasonable and probable grounds was exclusively information obtained from the electronic surveillance authorization. A good faith argument was not available because the information submitted in support of the warrant was tainted by the conduct utilized to obtain the authorization. The evidence obtained was equally a product of a serious infringement of the applicant's s.8 Charter rights because once the tainted evidence was excised for the affidavit in support there was no evidence supporting the issuance of the warrant. The privacy interest was comparatively high. The nature of the constitutional breach was major. The means of obtaining the authorization was misleading because the reasons offered for not conducting a further investigation lacked a factual basis. 6)The residence search warrant was set aside. The affidavit provided no indication of the source of the informer's knowledge. The issuing justice was therefore unable to assess the reliability or the credibility of the information. The fact the source is credible does not mean the information provided is reliable. 7)The seriousness of the breach was not at the high end of the scale. There was an attempt to comply with the Criminal Code and two of the three requirements were met. While good faith was not found with respect to the information offered in support of the electronic authorization, there was nothing in the information presented with respect to the search warrant that lead to a conclusion of bad faith. On balance the administration of justice would not be brought into disrepute with the admissibility of this evidence.  8)The Criminal Code makes no provision to add the names of civilians to a search warrant. The reasoning in R. v. West applied and the search of the Derksen residence was conducted in an unreasonable manner contrary to s.8 of the Charter. A Collins analysis favoured the inclusion of the evidence including the plants. The police were attentive to privacy issues in supervising and restricting the television cameras. The officer set grounds rules that the residence could not be identified in any broadcast. The drug section was not the initiator of inviting the media along. It was coincidence that the corporal did so on a search where the warrant was subsequently held to be invalid. The two events did not amount to a course of conduct. 9)The improper seizure and retention of personal property of the accused was a collateral matter and did not affect the fairness of the trial.","FIAT. The applicants were charged separately with cultivating marijuana and possession of marihuana. They were scheduled for separate trials this fall before Judge and Jury. As is the practice in this jurisdiction, defence brought a Charter motion in advance of jury selection to set aside two provisions of the authorization: a section 186 CCC 60 day authorization for electronic surveillance and a search warrant authorizing the observance of the applicant Begrand-Fast. A search warrant to search the applicant's residence in April 1997 primarily directed at their residences and their cell phones; a section 487.01(4) video surveillance authorization permitting the interception of private communications at residences of each accused on a 9 day video surveillance warrant and a subsequent search warrant both of these warrants were set aside on the basis they are derivative of the electronic authorization which is alleged to be unlawful. HELD: 1) Leave to cross-examine was granted when the trial judge was satisfied that cross-examination was necessary to enable the accused to make full answer and defence. As the Crown had the right to call evidence to expand, explain or add to the evidence elicited at the preliminary inquiry, it would appear an absolute waste of time and money to require duplication of such evidence on the Charter hearing. 2) The applicant sought to have the evidence obtained pursuant to the authorizations and warrants and excluded from trial and addressed the recognized difficulty of normal police investigative activity ever identifying the source of supply, particularly with respect to offences of trafficking, conspiracy, or being an accessory after the fact."
6_2003skqb170.txt,"The appellant, who received a suspended sentence with a one year probation order, appealed his conviction of assault (Criminal Code s.266) on the grounds the trial judge erred in law in making findings of fact and credibility based on evidence that did not exist (photographs of injuries that were not introduced into evidence at trial); by misapplying the appropriate standard of proof; although correctly articulating the test in R. v. W(D), misapplying that test in determining credibility; by failing to apply the appropriate test for a defence of necessity. The complainant, frightened by the sudden verbal outburst of the appellant, fled into the bush and refused to return because his mood had not changed. The trial judge did not accept the appellant's testimony that he used force only to protect the complainant from natural hazards in that location at night. HELD: The appeal was allowed. The conviction was set aside and a new trial was ordered. 1)Finding that there were photographs to corroborate the testimony of the complainant relating to her injuries was an error of law. No miscarriage of justice resulted from that error, as it was immaterial.  2)The trial judge clearly preferred the testimony of the complainant to that of the appellant but did not state why. It could not be concluded that his belief in the existence of photographs influenced the findings of credibility. Even if it did, there was still ample evidence to support a prima facie case of assault. Again no miscarriage of justice resulted. 3)The trial judge erred in law by failing to properly consider the defence of necessity. The three elements that must be present for a defence of necessity, as determined by the SCC in Latimer, include imminent peril or danger; absence of reasonable alternatives; proportionality between the harm inflicted and the harm avoided. The defence of necessity is considered in cases where there is an air of reality. The only evidence relating to the defence of necessity came from the appellant. It would not be appropriate in the circumstances of this case to substitute an acquittal. Had the trial judge applied the appropriate test, he may have come to a different conclusion.","The appellant was convicted of an assault contrary to s. 266 of the Criminal Code. His sentence was suspended with a 1-year probation order. He appealed from the conviction. HELD: The appeal was allowed and a new trial ordered.  1) The court was unable to conclude that his belief in the existence of photographs influenced his finding of credibility. Even if it did, there was still ample evidence to support a prima facie case of assault. 2) The trial judge failed to apply the appropriate test for a review of the circumstances of the case. The court found that finding that there were photographs to corroborate the testimony of the complainant relating to her injuries was an error of law. It was immaterial whether there were injuries. 3) The conviction could not be set aside for an error in law alone.  4) There were no miscarriage of justice or errors of justice.  5) Finding there were no photographs to substantiate the complainant's testimony related to her injury was an errors of law, as no fractures were suffered.  6) It would not be appropriate in the circumstances in this case to substitute an acquittal for a conviction. Had the trial judge applied an appropriate test, he may have come to the same conclusion."
6_2004skca37.txt,"Fulltext of judgment follows:[1] We do not need to hear from counsel for the respondent. I mentioned during the opening of this appeal that members of the panel had followed the usual practice of carefully reviewing the trial record and written arguments before this hearing.[2] We are all of the view that there is no basis to interfere with the decision of Mr. Justice Smith. As his extensive reasons for decision disclose he addressed the matter thoroughly. [3] This was a difficult case in which the trial judge was required to carefully address the competing claims for custody, but mindful of the 'best interests of the child'. Throughout the trial and in his reasons the learned trial judge focussed on this predominant issue. And in our view he addressed it as required by law. [4] We cannot say that the learned trial judge erred in any material respect when weighing and considering the evidence. Since the parties were unable to resolve the issues to their mutual satisfaction, it fell to the trial judge to make a 'hard choice'. He had the distinct advantage, that we do not have, of seeing and hearing the parties and being able to form an impression of them. [5] We dismiss this appeal with costs on double Column 5. [6] We cannot part from this appeal without noting the acrimonious history of litigation concerning custody and access. The welfare of [B.E.] would be better served by a spirit of compromise. The time, energy and expenses incurred in protracted litigation could be put to better use in advancing the welfare of this young child.","The appellant appealed the decision of the trial judge in relation to custody and access. HELD: Appeal dismissed orally. The trial judge was required to carefully address the competing claims for custody, but mindful of the best interests of the child.

6_2004skpc25.txt,"The accused was charged with driving a motor vehicle with a blood alcohol level exceeding .08. The Crown filed a certificate of analysis pursuant to s. 258(1)(g) of the Criminal Code for the purpose of proving the accused's blood alcohol level. The word and symbol 'Breathalyzer' had a line drawn through them and above the same was written 'Intoxilyzer'. There was no symbol with it. In the blank that followed was written '5000C'. This change was not initialed. The issue was whether s. 258(1)(g) of the Code requires that the approved instrument be identified by way of make and model. HELD: The charge was dismissed. The Court found the Crown could not rely on s. 258(1)(g) of the Code and there was no evidence of the accused's blood level. 1) The Court found that in order for a certificate of analysis under s. 258(1)(g) of the Code to constitute evidence as set out in that subsection, the make and model of the approved instrument has to be set out in the certificate or be proven by other evidence.  2) It was not possible to know who made the alteration. The use of a certificate is a shortcut afforded to the Crown. If it is to be employed, it must be employed correctly. In the circumstances, the approved instrument was not adequately identified as to make and model.","The accused is charged with driving an automobile with a blood alcohol level exceeding eighty milligrams of alcohol in 100 millilitres of blood. The police observed the vehicle drift back and forth between the centre line and the shoulder line within its own lane. They stopped the vehicle, which pulled over in an appropriate manner. The officers found the accused to be the driver. An approved screening device demand was made and at 1:54 a.m. the accused provided a sample into an Alcotest 7410 GLC. The result was an 'F'. The accused's eyes were somewhat flossy and her cheeks were slightlyushed. None of the other usual signs of impairment were present. The accused was transported back to the detachment where she was turned over to a qualified technician. The charge was dismissed. There was insufficient evidence to establish that the accused blew the instrument into an 'intoxilyzer' or that it was an approved instrument. The technician testified that she saw the accused blowing the instrument and noted an odour of liquor on the accused's breath, that her eyes were 'glossy' and they were 'flushed' and she was polite and cooperative. The Certificate of Analysis was filed under paragraph 258(1)(g) for the intended purpose of proving the accused’s blood alcohol levels. The alteration consisting of the striking out of the word and symbol “Breathalyzer®” and the writing in of the letter “2” bear his initials and the technician wrote the figure “3” in over the top of the second one. There were no reference at all to the name of the instrument in the certificate and the proof would be made by stating simply that the said sample was received directly into an instrument approved for this purpose pursuant to s. 237(6) of the Criminal Code. Parliament has the power to deem things to have been proven regardless of whether the question is one of fact or of law. HELD: The charge is dismissed. 1) In order for a certificate of analysis to constitute evidence as set out in subsection 254(1), the make and model of the approved instrument has to be set out either or be proven by other evidence. The Crown did not intend that there should be a requirement that the instrument be identified. The qualified technician did not adequately or adequately report the use of the model and the Crown could not rely upon any of the models described in the model nor could the Crown adequately rely upon them. 2) There was no evidence of the accused"
6_2005nsca65.txt,"Following the close of the Crown's case on a trial of several weapons related offences, the defence moved for a directed verdict on the basis that there was no evidence that the offences occurred on the date alleged in the Information. The Crown sought to amend the Information to change the date of the offences. Without ruling on the motion to amend, the trial judge granted the motion for a directed verdict. The Crown appealed. Appeal allowed; acquittals set aside; new trial ordered. The directed verdict should not have been granted as, in this case, the date of the offences was not an essential element of the offences. If the directed verdict was not based on the discrepancy with the date, than the appeal would have to be allowed on the basis that the trial judge gave insufficient reasons which prejudiced the Crown's right of appeal.","The Crown appealed the acquittals entered by the Provincial Court judge on five charges relating to the possession and storage of prohibited weapons. The Information alleged that police officers who were in attendance at a residence as a result of a fire were advised by firefighters of two sawed off shotguns in the home. The defence admitted that on May 30, 2003, the resident of the home where the firearms were found was subject to an order prohibiting possession of firearms and that he was not the holder of an firearms licence. At trial, defence counsel brought a motion for a directed verdict on the basis that there was no evidence of one of the elements of the offence, that is, the date of that offence, which was not an essential element. The trial judge granted the motion because the Crown had failed to prove that the date as alleged in the Information. That was an error of law. The reasons for granting the motion were so inadequate that they did not meet the test for sufficiency of reasons because they do not provide any indication of why there was insufficient evidence. HELD: The appeal was allowed with reasons to follow. Section 601(4) lists the factors that should be taken into consideration on an amendment application, which include whether the accused has been misled or prejudiced and whether the amendment would cause an injustice. Here, the word 'elements' used in the proposed amendment would not mislead or cause prejudice or injustice to the accused. There was no suggestion that the amendment of the date would affect the dates of the offences which were not the only insufficiency of evidence. Although it was not necessary to amend the Information, if the reason for the directed verdict was that it was too late to amend, that was also a reversible error."

The parties have agreed to an order of joint custody with the child residing primarily with the petitioner. The petitioner wishes to move from Saskatoon to Edmonton. HELD: Based on the loss of the respondent as an active co-parent and the petitioner's vague and uncertain plans for the child's care in Edmonton, it is not in the best interests of the child that he be allowed to relocate to Edmonton with the petitioner.","The petitioner and the respondent are the parents of the child. The petitioner separated in October 2003. They agreed to an order of joint custody with the primary residence being with the respondent. The respondent opposes the petitioner's move to Edmonton. The issues on the proposed relocation are: 1) is it in the best interests of the petitioner to relocate from Saskatoon to Edmonton; and 2) what is an appropriate access schedule for the respondent to be with the petitioner. HELD: The respondent is to have joint custody of all of the children. The Court reviewed the factual background in these decisions. Based on the loss of Harley as an active co-parent coupled with Charlene's vague and uncertain plans for the child's care in Edmonton, the Court found that it was not in the children's best interests to allow the relocation. 2) The respondent does not have access to the child at his parent's home. The court reviewed the existing custody arrangement and the relationship between the child and the custodial parent and the desirability of maximizing contact between the children and both [page120] parents. The record discloses that the respondent is a good father with the help of his parents. He has had a stable arrangement in Saskatoon which provides significant and almost daily contact with both parents. One effect of granting the petitioner permission to move would be to undermine the co- parenting arrangement reflected in the minutes of settlement. In practice, the child will no longer benefit from the respondent's access schedule. 3) The petitioner is concerned about furthering her education. She has her grade 12 and the child from high school to Alberta. Her parents live and work in White Court, Alberta. 4) The Court was satisfied that the petitioner has the psychological bond between the petitioner and Harley that would be lost if the petitioner were allowed to relocate to Edmonton and that if the respondent moved to Edmonton, he would lose the bond he now has with Harley. 5) It is not necessary for the Court to deal with this as the petitioner declined to allow her to move with the child to Edmonton with the intention of having the child live with her in Edmonton with her parents. 6) The court was mindful of the comments of McLachlin J. (as she then was) in Gordon v. Goertz (1996) that a parent's reason for relocating is only relevant in the exceptional case where it impacts on that parent's ability to meet their child's needs. A more precise test would risk sacrificing the child if he were to have as much contact with each parent as"
6_2007nssc119.txt,"Two teenaged children were placed in the care of the father, who resided in Alberta, under the joint supervision of the Nova Scotia and Alberta agencies. Unknown to the court, the father's common law partner had an extensive child protection history. There were significant problems in the father's home, resulting in the older child removing herself from her father's care and going to live with an adult relative who also had a child protection history and the younger child disappearing for a time until the mother, who lived in Nova Scotia, finally tracked him down. The mother now sought the return of both children. The Nova Scotia agency sought to have its involvement terminated, arguing that both children were now old enough to self-protect. Although the younger child wished to return to the mother, the older child threatened to run away if removed from her current living situation. Children removed from the supervised care of the father and placed in the temporary care of the Nova Scotia agency with access to the mother and services to be provided to the mother and the children; the agency misled both the mother and the court by failing to disclose crucial information about the father's common law partner and the circumstances of the children once they were placed with the father and this failure was both inexplicable and inexcusable; costs are the appropriate remedy against the agency. Although the mother had completed some counseling, there was a substantial risk that both children would suffer physical harm if returned to her care due to her inability to supervise and protect them adequately. The mother continued to require professional intervention.","The parties were involved in a rocky common law relationship between 1985 and 1995. They lived in Alberta and then Nova Scotia.

The children were apprehended by the Agency and placed in the supervised care of their father, who became the custodial parent. The Agency sought to have the supervision order dismissed as the children did not want to live with their father; the Agency consented to its continued involvement with the child; the respondent did not participate at this disposition review although he had participated in previous hearings. HELD: 1)The information concerning the child protection history was simply not germane to the decision made. 2)The documents contained historical references only and related, not to the father, but rather to his common law partner.  3)The Agency did not disclose relevant information to the court or to the Court regarding the children's placement with the father. 4)The agency was required to assume sole responsibility for the children, who were in the adult care of T.B. who was the guardian of the children. 5)It was necessary for the court to determine the proper disposition order in respect of the three children, namely, whether the information contained in the files was relevant to the decisions made by the agency, the parents and the court.  6)The primary issue was whether the files were properly categorized and properly categorized. 7)The files were to be categorized according to their ages. 8)The oldest child was 12 and the youngest child was 13 years of age. 9)The younger child was prone to violent outbursts and extreme abuse. It would appear that the mother could not sustain whatever gains she made over time. The younger child had a history of neglect, physical abuse and lack of supervision. The older child could not run from her mother's home and sometimes get involved in fights with her sister. There were ongoing issues regarding the mother's access to the children and the fact that the father had moved in with her. 10)There was no evidence of physical or sexual abuse by the mother. The oldest child had been diagnosed with bipolar disorder. She was not able to name the father but indicated that he had a previous history with the Agency. 11)She was unable to recall if there had been any contact with the mother prior to and during the time that the children had moved to Alberta.  12)"

6_2008skca156.txt,"The Crown appeals an order from Provincial Court declaring that the accused is unfit to stand trial. The accused was charged with 29 offences arising out of failures to comply with multiple bail conditions. He was also charged with two indictable thefts. He is 22 years old and suffers from fetal alcohol spectrum disorder, attention deficit disorder and substance abuse. He was diagnosed as mildly mentally retarded and is considered incapable of handling the responsibilities that would enable him to live independently and will always need a protected living environment and sheltered employment. He was found unfit to stand trial on some previous property offences and is still under the supervision of the Provincial Review Board. The trial judge was satisfied that the accused met the first two criteria for fitness to stand trial Ã» he understood the nature of the charges against him and the possible consequences of being found guilty and he understood the difference between a guilty and not guilty plea. The focus of the decision was whether the accused had the capacity to communicate with counsel. The judge found that the accused would not be able to provide instruction to counsel during the trial process due in part to the fact that he is very distractable and could not sufficiently follow court proceedings to instruct counsel. HELD: Appeal allowed. The verdict of unfit to stand trial is set aside and a new trial ordered. The trial judge applied too stringent a test on concluding that the accused was unfit to stand trial and when the proper test is applied, it is apparent that the accused has the capacity to instruct counsel within the meaning of the Code. The trial judge's concern about the accused's distractable nature does not accord with the limited cognitive capacity test. The Courts have applied a test of 'limited cognitive capacity' for determining fitness. This test requires that, with respect to communicating to counsel, the accused is only required to be capable of recounting the fact of the alleged crimes. Limited cognitive capacity does not require analytic ability or the need for the accused to appreciate his own best interests. The authorities establish a very low threshold for fitness to stand trial in keeping with the policy objectives of the Criminal Code and the right of the accused to make full answer and defence.","This is an appeal by the Crown from an order of a Provincial Court Judge declaring that the respondent is unfit to stand trial. The Crown submits that the trial judge misapprehended evidence, misstated the evidence, applies the wrong legal test for fitness, applied the wrong burden of proof and made a finding that was unreasonable and not supported by the evidence. HELD: Appeal allowed. 1) The limited cognitive capacity test (limited cognitive capacity) test strikes an effective balance between the objectives of the fitness rules and the constitutional right of the accused to choose his own defence and to have a trial within a reasonable time. 2) The respondent is 22 years old and suffers from fetal alcohol spectrum disorder, attention deficit disorder and substance abuse/dependence disorder. He has been diagnosed as suffering from paranoid schizophrenia and is unable to distinguish reality from fantasy. 3) As the appellant has grown up and started residing in foster care, he has consistently run away from the protected environments sought for him and has begun to abuse alcohol and drugs. He is currently under the supervision of the Provincial Review Board. 4) There are strong interests, both public and personal, in an accused being fit to proceed to trial. In this case, the public interest is in ensuring that persons who are accused of committing crimes are brought to justice. The personal interests are paramount. The accused has the right to a fair trial and to make full answer and defence to the allegations with which he is charged."

M. a person under the age of fourteen years directly with a part of his body contrary to s. 151(a) of the Criminal Code. After reviewing the circumstances of the offence and the offender, in addition to sentencing principles as set out in the case law and statutes, the Court found that this was not a case where a conditional sentence served in the community is available or appropriate.

6_2009skqb394.txt,"The plaintiff bought a house. She used the services of Cecilia Mui, a realtor associated with the defendant 100% Realty Associates Ltd. operating as Re/max Saskatoon. The house was purchased from the defendants Edward and Verl Karpinski. The vendors' realtor was the defendant, Mario Jacobucci, owner of the defendant Trevi Holdings Ltd. The house did not meet the plaintiff's expectations. She now sues the defendants seeking recovery of damages for alleged latent defects. She claims Ms. Mui fell below the standard of care required of a realtor representing a purchaser. She claims Ms. Mui was negligent in misrepresenting certain facts and breached the fiduciary duty expected of her. The plaintiff claims the Karpinskis misrepresented facts to her, negligently and fraudulently. The plaintiff claims that Mr. Jacobucci and his company are liable to her in damages, both in negligence and as parties to the misrepresentations made by the vendors. Special and general damages are claimed as are aggravated damages and punitive damages. The trial took place over 22 days, spanning several years and included testimony from 14 witnesses. Two main issues are raised. The first is the liability of each of the defendants. The second issue is quantum of damages. The credibility of the parties is at the forefront of the determination of the issues. HELD: The vendors are liable to the plaintiff for breach of contract. Each of the defendants is a tortfeasor, each having breached an obligation or duty owed to the plaintiff, whether through negligence or misrepresentation. Their wrongful acts and omissions all contributed to the same damage. In that respect their liability is concurrent. The liability of the vendors and Mr. Jacobucci is joint, and that of Ms. Mui is several. As concurrent torfeasors, the fault for the damage shall be apportioned equally among the four of them.  1) Credibility is not a science, see R. v. Gagnon, 2006 SCC 17. It is not always possible to articulate with precision the complex intermingling of impressions that emerge after watching and listening to witnesses and attempting to reconcile the various versions of events. The principles and tools to be used in assessing credibility are summarized in Novak Estate (Re), 2008 NSSC 283. 2) Certain of the evidence of the Karpinskis and Ms. Mui is so unreliable that the whole of their evidence is cast with doubt. 3) The opinions and conclusions of Mr. Loraas and Mr. Epp are accepted by the court. They are professionals with no interest in the outcome of the action. Their evidence was largely unchallenged. The Court finds that the pine shakes were rotten, sealant had been applied to the shakes on at least two occasions and prior to the plaintiff offering to buy the property, the shakes were not properly installed allowing water to seep into the house, the skylight leaked and caulking had been applied to stop the leaking before the plaintiff offered to buy the house, there was improper and inadequate venting which resulted in moisture damage to the interior of the house and mold in the attic, the moisture damage in the house included damage to drywall and paint blisters. Nail pops throughout the house were largely the result of the house being moved. No inspection was done after the house was moved. 4) The Court finds the Karpinskis did not speak truthfully or completely when they answered the questions in the Property Condition Disclosure Statement (PCDS). The Court does not accept that the vendors were not aware of water and moisture damage arising from the improperly installed shingles, the missing ridge caps, the leaking skylight or the lack of venting. The sealant on the roof was sufficiently old to predate the plaintiff's purchase of the house. The vendors repaired the sink holes and moisture pockets and effectively concealed the problems. It should have been disclosed. Although the vendors denied knowing of the structural damage to their house, they knew the house had been cut in half and moved 300 kilometers and had sustained damage. The structural problems were concealed by the vendors through repairs to the dry wall, reinforcement at stress points, and repainting and patching of wall paper. The fact that the house had been cut in half and moved should have been disclosed on the PCDS. 5) It is not only current defects or ongoing problems that need to be disclosed on a PCDS. A prospective purchaser does not look to the PCDS only to ascertain that the roof is not leaking on the day it was signed, see Kaufmann v. Gibson, [2007] O.J. No. 2711 (Ont. S.C.) (QL). The Karpinskis are liable to the plaintiff for breach of contract for failing to disclose the existence of structural defects, damage due to water and roof leakage. The terms of the PCDS formed part of the agreement between the parties and the deliberate withholding of this information amounted to a false representation as to the condition of the home. With respect to damage arising from these defects, the doctrine of caveat emptor does not apply. 6) The requirements for negligent misrepresentation have been established by the plaintiff. The failure to disclose, or silence as to a known defect, amounts to an act of concealment of a material fact and has the same effect as an express misrepresentation and is sufficient to attract liability, Thomas v. Blackwell, 1999 SKQB 168. 7) The false representations knowingly made by the vendors and their silence as to material facts were fraudulent. 8) Ms. Mui was negligent and her conduct and advice to the plaintiff fell below the standard of care expected of a realtor acting for the purchaser of a rural property in 1999. She did not conduct any preliminary background checks with the Rural Municipality, which would include determining if proper permits had been obtained, prior to the plaintiff's offer to purchase. Ms. Mui did nothing more than merely mention a home inspection to the plaintiff on one occasion. At no time did she recommend a home inspection even after she knew the house had been moved and before the condition regarding a satisfactory PCDS was removed. Another reason to strongly recommend a home inspection would be in circumstances where the realtor knew that a rural municipality did not require building inspections and Ms. Mui knew this to be the case. The plaintiff relied on the representation of Ms. Mui to her detriment. Had Ms. Mui disclosed all material facts to the plaintiff and explained and recommended a home inspection, the Court is satisfied that the outcome for the plaintiff would have been different. Knowing the house had been moved and had not been inspected the plaintiff would have most likely reconsidered her decision to purchase. 9) The Court is satisfied that Mr. Jacabucci is liable to the plaintiff for negligent misrepresentation. He represented that the home was of 'quality construction'. This was incorrect. Mr. Jacobucci was also complicit in, and party to, the negligent misrepresentations made by the vendors in the PCDS. He knew the house had been moved and sustained damage. He also knew the skylight leaked. The plaintiff relied on these misrepresentations and damages resulted.  10) The costs incurred by the plaintiff to repair the house total $17,613. She is awarded $15,000 as compensation for personal time and effort that she expended in repairing the home. There is no evidence that the distress the plaintiff experienced constituted a physical injury, or a recognized psychiatric illness and she cannot be compensated for mental distress, whether under tort or breach of contract. She is awarded $10,000 for aggravated damages. Her claim for punitive damages is dismissed. Her claim for solicitor and client costs is dismissed. Corrigendum received dated December 3, 2009 and added to fulltext.","The plaintiff purchased a home in 1998. She engaged the services of the defendant Cecilia Mui, a realtor associated with the defendant 100% Realty. Mui misrepresented facts to the plaintiff, including that the skylight was leaking and there were insects in the house. The defendants failed to inform the plaintiff that the home had been moved over 300 kilometres from its original building site. Water entered through a dormer window with rotting casing. The plaintiff sued the defendants seeking recovery of damages for alleged latent defects in the home. She claimed aggravated damages against all defendants and punitive damages against the defendants and against the husband's company for failing to make a Property Condition Disclosure Statement (PCDS) which formed a condition of the contract for sale. She also claimed special and general damages against both parties for negligence and as parties to the misrepresentations made by the husband and wife.

6_2010nssc154.txt,"The corporate defendant moved (under Rule 44.10 of the 2008 Rules) for an order terminating an attachment order made against it, and under Rule 32.02(3) to change the venue from Halifax to Windsor. The latter was not opposed. There was also an issue regarding an affidavit filed by the respondent, which referenced but did not attach the applicant's defence. The respondent argued it was unnecessary to attach a document already filed with the court. Change of venue granted in part: the applications will continue to be heard in Halifax, but the trial will be held in Windsor as requested. Neither party has a connection to Halifax. The respondent operates from Stewiacke and the dispute arose in Hants County. The attachment order is terminated, with costs of $1,000 to the applicant. An attachment order is an intrusive pre-trial remedy and will hinder the corporate applicant's attempts to resume/expand operations. Here there is no conduct to justify maintaining the order. The mere allegation of a connection between the individual and corporate defendants is insufficient to cause the court to pierce the corporate veil. The respondent has failed to establish any of the relevant grounds governing attachment orders. The Rules require facts, not allegations or suspicions. The affidavit in question was flawed. It should have attached the defence in order to properly incorporate the references to it.","One of the defendants in the main proceeding moved for an order terminating an attachment order against it pursuant to Rule 44.10(b) of the Civil Procedure Rules (1972). The plaintiff alleged the defendant had interfered with the plaintiff's timber harvesting contract by threatening violence, making gestures and other threats and interfering with the workers conducting the harvest operation. The plaintiff argued the attachment order should be terminated because it was not required to secure the party who obtained it, the existence of one or more grounds of attachment as set out in Rule 49.01(1), and that the mere allegation of a connection between the individual and corporate defendants was not sufficient reason to dispose of the corporate veil. The court awarded costs to the applicant of $1,000 payable in any event in the cause.  1)The affidavit of February 28, 1991 did not properly incorporate the contents of the statement of claim. The witness did not say the contents were true. 2)The plaintiff did not establish any of the grounds available under the rules governing attachment orders."

Held, motion dismissed. Under Rule 14.01, the motions judge must decide relevancy based on the pleadings and evidence produced on the motion as if the matter were raised at trial. The party seeking production must establish relevance. Here, the only evidence was regarding the occurrence of the fires; there was no evidence as to the manner of the defendant's operation of the business in the second location that would establish relevance to the action regarding the first location.

She did not seek spousal support as part of her original application to the Court. In August of 2013, the petitioner sought to amend her petition to include a claim for spousal support based on the Spousal Support Advisory Guidelines. In January of 2014, the petitioner filed an application for interim spousal support retroactive to the date of separation. HELD: The petitioner was awarded spousal support, but the award was not retroactive to the date of separation. The petitioner was entitled to spousal support from the date that she put the respondent on notice of her application for spousal support. The respondent, at age 61, should not be forced to work overtime in order to meet his spousal support obligations. The Court found there was economic disparity between the income of the petitioner and the income of the respondent and awarded an interim award of non-compensatory spousal support in the amount of $400 per month, retroactive to November 1, 2013, until further order of the Court.","FIAT: Following the provisions of the Divorce Act for awards of spousal support, the court considers the economic disparity between the respondent and petitioner's incomes that is $79,320.00 versus $56,103.00, is sufficiently disparate and upon which an interim award of non-compensatory spousAL support is appropriate. HELD: 1) The court does not grant retroactive support prior to the respondent being put on effective notice that the petitioner was now seeking it. At the respondent's age and given his state of health, this Court will not compel the respondent to work more than a 40 hour work week by attributing to him an income which is based upon significant overtime income. At 61 years old, the petitioner commenced this family law proceeding by issuing a petition in which she sought divorce and equal division of the family property estate. The petitioner did not seek any form of corollary relief pursuant to the s. 8 and s. 7 of the divorce act nor did she claim for spousa support under the terms of the Family Maintenance Act, 1997. The respondent filed a within application in which the petitioner sought divorce. This application was referred to and granted October 22, 2013. It is pertinent to note that the SAGE, as a guide, is used only to refer to the petitioner's income. It does not compel a payor to work overtime. The court found that the respondent’s gross income in the year 2013 to his pay period was $95,275.73 and included $28,553.68 of overtime income but did not claim for child support under s. 9 or s. 10 of the D.B.S.C.R. (CanLII) Act and the Carol Rogerson and Rollie Thompson Guidelines for Spousal Support Advisory Guidelines. 2) The petitioner indicated that she intended to work a standard 40 hour week at the rate of $28.50 per hour. This represents an annual income of $59,280. 3) The respondent indicated that he intends to work standard 40 hours of workweek.

The second defendant was the lessor of the vehicle. The plaintiff brought an action against both the lessor and lessee, arguing that the second defendant was liable, both as the owner of the vehicle under the Motor Vehicle Act and pursuant to common law vicarious liability, for the lessee's negligence. The second defendant successfully applied for summary judgment, with the court finding that the lessor was not liable under the Motor Vehicle Act as the lease was not a 'rental contract' as defined in s. 62 of the Act and the lessor was not an 'owner' as defined in s. 2(ak) and the current state of the law did not suggest that a claim of vicarious liability had a real chance of success between a lessor and lessee. Both the plaintiff and the first defendant appealed. Appeal dismissed; the reverse onus provision in s. 248 does not apply in this case; the argument that the lease was not a conditional sales agreement but rather a rental agreement had no real chance of success and the fact that a vehicle is subject to a lease does not change the fact that there is no vicarious liability at common law between the owner and the driver of a vehicle.","The appellants appealed a decision granting summary judgment to the respondent, Chrysler, on the basis that it was not vicariously liable for the negligence of the plaintiff. At issue was whether the Chambers judge erred in determining that the action against Chrysler had no reasonable chance of success and whether the lease agreement had none of the characteristics of a rental agreement as contemplated by s. 62 of the Motor Vehicle Act. The reverse onus provision did not apply. The appellants argued that the trial judge failed to apply the law in Bazley, [1999] S.C.R. 534, at para. 5; and (2010) SCC. He also addressed the issue of whether Chrysler was an owner within the meaning of s. 2(ak) of the Act. HELD: Appeal dismissed. 1) The Chambers judge did not err in determining there were no material facts in dispute and it was incumbent on him to make the determinations of law arising from those undisputed facts. The lease clearly fell into the 'lease with right of purchase' exception to the definition of 'owner.' 2) In Bazley the issue was not whether the appellants established a claim for vicarious liability against Chrysler but rather whether the plaintiff had a real chance at success. 3) There was no evidence that the Gold Key Lease was filed or was filed with the Registrar.  4) There were no issues of credibility and no need to weigh the evidence with respect to the version of events.  5) The lease was distinguishable on its facts, from the present situation. It involved an employee committing an intentional tort on a vulnerable victim during the course of his employment. The insurer was not a participant in the motion or on this appeal."
7_2011nspc27.txt,"The female driver, the accused and two other men were in a vehicle that was stopped on suspicion of being involved in a robbery. A gun and many of the stolen items were found in the vehicle and all the occupants were charged with a number of offences, including robbery. The accused denied being in the area where the robbery occurred but alleged that they had stopped and picked up the two other men. While at the police station, he pulled a ring that had been reported stolen out of his pants and placed it on his finger. At his trial, one of the other men testified that he had pled guilty to the robbery; the driver testified that she had driven directly from her home to where the vehicle was stopped by the police, without stopping; and the complainant testified that he had been lured to the driver's house, where he was ambushed by her and three men, robbed and threatened. Although his descriptions matched the two other males in the vehicle, he positively stated that the accused was not the third person. Accused found not guilty on all charges; the Crown had not proven that he was involved in the robbery or that he should have known there was a gun or stolen property in the car. Although the circumstances in which the accused was taken into custody were more than suspicious, the fact that the complainant had clearly seen the robbers but had made a positive non-identification created an inconsistency that raised a reasonable doubt.","The accused, a young person, was taken into custody after police stopped a car suspected of being involved in a robbery with a firearm at a specific address in Sackville. The car was stopped minutes after the robbery with the person who had pleaded guilty to the robbery and a gun and number of items reported to have been stolen in the robbery. The gun was found under the back seat of the car loaded. The accused was not asked to implicate him directly but said that he had been picked up at some building somewhere in Fairview. HELD: The court found that the evidence of the accused's involvement would have to be so strong that it would allow the inference to be made that the accused was just wrong. The circumstantial evidence suggested that the person in the car who was picked up by the police was the person they believed to be the person involved. The evidence did not support the inference, in the absence of evidence pointing to the identity of the other accused, which was not supported by the other evidence. It was reasonable to expect the accused to have some familiarity with the area where the robbery was alleged to have taken place and that he would have been familiar with the people involved."
7_2011skpc143.txt,"The plaintiff filed a number of duplicate claims on behalf of a number of individuals. The issue was whether the claims should be issued. HELD: Section 7(1) of The Small Claims Act provides that a Provincial Court Judge acts as a gatekeeper to insure that claims comply with the Act before they are issued. In this role, the Provincial Court judge is exercising a quasi judicial function. Counsel for the plaintiff has clearly indicated that the claim is a test case. The plaintiff seeks declaratory relief. A substantial amount of the claim involves an allegation of breach of contract, but neither the plaintiff nor the proposed defendants were signatories to the contract. Accordingly, they would not be entitled to the benefit of the agreement. As virtually all of the potential issues raised by these claims are declaratory in nature, they are outside the jurisdiction of the Provincial Court. Any litigation over these issues must be done in the Court of Queen's Bench.","The court refused to issue summonses to the defendant in relation to a number of claims. The defendant had submitted 18 claims for issuing to the court on behalf of the claimants. In the interim, the defendant responded to an Interim Ruling issued by the judge. The judge did not provide a clear understanding of what was going on in the interim Ruling or the principles related to an accounting by way of lawsuit. The plaintiff alleged that under the Small Claims Act the defendant breached his fiduciary obligation and incidental duties to preserve the rights and privileges of the plaintiff and to not engage in illegal, unlawful, coercive or obstructive acts. The issues raised by the claims were important issues to the potential plaintiffs and litigation, in the court's view, must be done in the Court of Queen's Bench, by either issuing a new claim or by enforcement proceedings of the claim."
7_2012skqb338.txt,"Under Part 40 of The Queen's Bench Rules (QBR), the plaintiffs commenced an action in 2009 against the defendant for the return of their deposit and the recovery of their costs for plans with respect to a residential construction contract. The defendant denied the claim and affidavits were exchanged before a simplified trial date was set for May 2012. The trial was rescheduled to June when counsel for the defence withdrew. Just before the trial, the president of the defendant corporation requested that he be allowed to represent his corporation pursuant to Rule 10(2) of the QBR and notified the Court and the plaintiffs that his corporation had just been dissolved. This development raised three issues to be decided before the simplified trial could proceed: 1) did the Court have jurisdiction to hear the simplified trial; 2) what is the status of the dissolved corporate defendant?; and 3) what is the appropriate process during the trial? HELD: Regarding the first issue, the Court held that it had jurisdiction pursuant to s. 219(2) of The Business Corporations Act. With respect to the second issue, the Court held that again, pursuant to its interpretation of s. 219 of the Act, that the trial should proceed and that the dissolved corporate defendant be allowed to defend the action on the ground that if liability continues, so should the right to defend the action. As far as the third issue was concerned, the Court held that simplified trial would proceed and that the president of the dissolved corporate defendant would be permitted to represent it. Since the parties had given notice that they wished to cross-examine the deponents of affidavits filed in each other's case, the Court ordered that the deponents be produced for the purpose of cross-examination.","FIAT: The plaintiffs commenced their statement of claim under Part 40 of The Queen's Bench Rules of Saskatchewan on April 27, 2009. Their claim is with respect to a construction residential contract of purchase and sale. The defendant corporation withdrew and Orion Morgan, president of the defendant corporation, asked for an adjournment of the simplified trial which was granted on May 2, 2012. At that time, Orion Morgan advised counsel for the plaintiffs and the Court that his corporation had recently been dissolved. Orion Morgan was listed on the defendant's affidavit of documents and witnesses dated August 10, 2011 as person who might reasonably be expected to have knowledge of transactions or occurrences in issue. More than 2 months have gone by since the affidavit of Marilee Fehr was provided to the plaintiffs. The strength of any argument of the plaintiffs being taken by surprise with the content of any last minute affidavit has been substantially diminished. The Court is going to make an interim order subject to further argument by the plaintiffs on September 5, 2012, that the Court accept Ms. Fehr's affidavit. Accordingly, she should make herself available for the purpose of cross-examination, if the plaintiff corporation still wants to file her affidavit in support of its case. If not, the Court will disregard the contents of her affidavit. HELD: The Court held that based on the basic and fundamental principle of trial fairness, the matter would and should proceed as if the corporation had not been dissolved and still existed. If this corporation still existed, it would be entitled to defend an action initiated against it before its dissolution. It is only fair that the struck or dissolved corporation should be allowed to defend itself in an action commenced before the dissolution of the corporation. The broad language of s. 152(2) and basic principles of fairness demand such an interpretation. If a case law authority has found a contrary interpretation to similar provisions in other provinces, the court is not prepared to follow those decisions but to follow other case law that supports the interpretation the Court made in this case."
7_2012skqb510.txt,"The defendant was charged with unlawfully harvesting forest products contrary to s. 79(1)(a) of The Forest Resources Management Act, unlawfully possessing forest products without a licence contrary to s. 79(1)(c) and unlawfully trafficking in forest products contrary to s. 79(1)(f) of the Act. He was acquitted of the first two charges and convicted of the third. He appealed his conviction. He was fined $1,000 with a 40% surcharge. The Crown appealed the sentence. The appellant argued that since he was acquitted of the related charges, it followed that he should not have been convicted of trafficking. The charges had arisen as a result of a lengthy undercover investigation into the activities of the appellant. He was known to be harvesting fire kill in the Nesbitt Forest, which was Crown land. He stored wood on his property and on that of a relative. If the appellant was using it himself, he did not require a permit. The undercover conservation officer purchased fire wood from the appellant, who told the officer that the wood was from Crown land in an answer to officer's question whether it was cut on private land. The appellant did not testify at his trial nor did his relative and so the evidence of the conservation officer was uncontradicted. The evidence presented on his behalf was from individuals who had purchased wood from the defendant. The trial judge held that the charges against the appellant were strict liability offences and once the Crown had demonstrated beyond a reasonable doubt that the prohibited acts had been committed, the appellant had to establish on the balance of probabilities that he had been duly diligent and took all reasonable care to avoid offending. With respect to the first two charges, the trial judge held that he was not satisfied that during the period described in the indictment that the Crown had proven the actus reus of the offences but that it had on the third count, based on the appellant's own words to the officer. The appellant argued on appeal that his words could have been taken to mean that he was describing where he harvested wood for his own use and therefore his statement was not an admission that he sold wood to the officer or anyone else from Crown lands. HELD: The Court held that the trial judge erred in his reasoning and conclusion that appellant was guilty of trafficking because he had not been duly diligent. It is only if the actus reus was proven beyond a reasonable doubt that the considerations of whether due diligence had been proven would arise. The conviction could not be maintained because the qualifying actus reus was not proven. However, the other aspect of the evidence, which was not expressly considered by the trial judge and which would sustain a conviction, was if evidence established trafficking via another modality. Since s. 2(dd) of the Act defines 'traffic' to mean 'to offer for sale, barter, deal, solicit or tradeÃ ' and s. 79(1) states that it is an offence to traffic in forest products from Crown land without a licence, then the offence is complete by offering the product for sale without a licence. The appellant led no evidence to establish he had either the required permit to harvest forest products from Crown lands or a licence or any other form of authorization to deal in forest products. Thus, the evidence established beyond a reasonable doubt that the appellant was guilty of trafficking in forest products contrary to s. 79(1)(f) of the Act. The conviction was upheld. Regarding sentencing, the Court held that it was important to deter other offenders. The trial judge's sentence of a fine equivalent to the levy avoided (the provincial charge per cord of wood) was inappropriately low. The Court set the appropriate fine at $5,000 plus a victim fund surcharge of 40% as required by s. 3 of The Victims of Crime Regulations. If the fine was not paid within 60 days, the appellant would serve a term of imprisonment of 90 days.","HELD: The court upheld the sentence of $1,000 with a 40% surcharge for the offence of unlawfully trafficking in forest products. The Crown appealed the sentence imposed on the defendant on a charge of unlawfully harvesting forest products contrary to s. 79(1)(f) of The Forest Resources Management Act. The defendant was found not guilty on all of the counts. The court found that the Crown had proven beyond a reasonable doubt that the wood sold to the undercover officer was wood coming from Crown lands. Therefore, the conviction should be quashed. The Court of Queen's Bench stated that it was not satisfied that during the period the defendant harvested wood from Crown land and he also sold wood from private lands, but that he also cuts firewood from private property and heats his own home with firewood. The evidence presented by conservation officers was found to be sufficiently ambiguous that the court should not have taken this as an admission, proving beyond areasonable doubt, that wood comprising the 150 truckloads and the 58 truckloads sold in 2009 or the three cords sold to Clarke."
7_2015skqb352.txt,"Family Law – Custody and Access – Best Interests of ChildFamily Law – Custody and Access – Interim – VariationFamily Law – DivorceFamily Law – Evidence – AffidavitThe parties were in a high-conflict situation and brought five interim applications with various requests. They had three children, the youngest being born five days before a previous application. At the initial application the respondent mother was living in the family home and the petitioner was living at the family cottage and expected to move into the new home when it was ready. The petitioner did move into the home, which was a few blocks from the family home. The youngest child was almost a year old and the petitioner was having increased parenting time with him. The parties agreed to have a custody and access report prepared. The issues were: 1) divorce; 2) registration of the middle child in Montessori school. The respondent opposed the child attending the school because he was not yet potty trained. The petitioner advised that the school was okay with the child not being potty trained; 3) to take the child to a speech therapist. The parties ended up resolving the issue before chambers; 4) varying the existing parenting arrangements.  There was an interim order from January 2015 made shortly after the third child was born. The respondent had since hired a full-time nanny. The respondent did not necessarily oppose the petitioner spending more time with the youngest child, but she wanted to be the one to control the developing of that time. The petitioner wanted the child Wednesday afternoon to evening and Sunday from 11:00 am to 4:00 pm. He also wanted increased time with the two older children so that he could get them to their necessary activities and so that they could continue to develop their bond with him; 5) arrears of child and spousal support; 6) the respondent’s request to return the 2005 vehicle. The vehicle had been at the parties’ farm and was damaged beyond repair without insurance. The petitioner then towed the vehicle to the respondent’s home; 7) objections to one of the petitioner’s affidavits; and 8) costs. HELD: The issues were decided as follows: 1) the divorce was granted because the parties had been separated in excess of a year and no satisfactory reasons were argued for not allowing it; 2) the court held that it would be appropriate for the child to be enrolled in the Montessori school. The cost of the program was ordered to be paid by the petitioner. The parties were to agree on the child’s transportation to the school and if they could not agree the petitioner would transport him; 3) the court kept the issue under its jurisdiction so that either party could bring the matter back upon two days’ notice; 4) the pre-trial conference was months away and the court did not find it appropriate to have the matter of increased parenting time proceed to a pre-trial conference, as a stand-alone issue. The court found that it was in the best interests of all the children to have further time with the petitioner as he requested. The court also dealt with transportation for the hockey and the middle child’s skating; 5) counsel agreed that the issue of arrears due under the support provisions would await further discussion at the pre-trial conference with either party having leave to bring the matter back on two days’ notice; 6) the matter was adjourned sine die on two days’ notice; 7) the complaints were not generally well-founded; and 8) the petitioner was entitled to costs of $1,000 in any event of the cause. The respondent was entitled to costs of $200 in any event of the cause. The court declined to send the matter to the high-conflict mediation program.","HELD: The Court granted the application. It ordered the child to be registered in the Montessori program and begin attending as soon as the program was able to accommodate such attendance. The cost of that program was to be paid at the trial stage by the petitioner. The Court held that it was not appropriate to have the matter of increasing parenting time proceed to a pre-trial conference, as a stand-alone issue, even an expedited pre- trial conference."

The claim against SaskTel has no reasonable prospect of success. The statement of claim contains the following information: 1) the plaintiff was last employed by SaskTel in a temporary position (term) that lasted from April 2, 1990 to November 30, 1990. 2) the defendant states that it appears that the plaintiff's Claim may allege that he was injured at work during his time at Sasktel, while the defendant does not admit this fact, if the Claim is allegedly based on such injury, then the Defendant pleads the Workers' Compensation Act, 2013 R.S.S., Ch. 11 as amended and states that the Plaintiff's only possible claim is for workers' compensation benefits from the WCC. 3) SaskTel filed Statement of Defence on August 26, 2014 and the claim apparently is about events from 1990 and therefore any claim is statute barred under the Limitations Act. If the circumstances warrant, the Court may order one or more of the following: (a) that all or any part of pleading or other document be struck out; (b) that the pleading or document discloses a reasonable claim or defence; (c) disclose no reasonable cause of action; (d) the pleadings carefully; (e) the claim must be struck; (f) be plain and obvious, the facts of the claim are considered to be true unless manifestly incapable of proof, it is incumbent on the plaintiff to clearly plead the facts upon which he relies in making his claim; (g) have the claim and have the evidence; (h) the claims against Sasktel have no reasonable prospects of success and should be struck"", the order states.

7_2018skqb90.txt,"Civil Procedure – Queen’s Bench Rules, Rule 6-75 The applicant insurance company sought an order for interpleader pursuant to Queen’s Bench rule 6-75 regarding premium surpluses it held in the amount of $3,550,800 that were generated between 1990, when it issued a group life insurance policy to the respondent, Agricultural Credit Corporation (Ag Credit), and 2015, when Ag Credit terminated the policy. The applicant requested that the monies be paid into court and that directions be provided as to how the determination of ownership would be decided. Ag Credit took the position that the funds paid as premiums were Crown funds and thus any surpluses were the property of the Crown and properly payable to Ag Credit as its agent. It argued that the interpleader order was unnecessary. The purpose of the group life insurance was to ensure that outstanding loans made by Ag Credit to borrowers were paid in the event of the borrowers’ deaths. Individual borrowers paid the premiums applicable to them by paying those amounts to Ag Credit, who remitted the payments to the applicant. There was no clear direction regarding the surpluses in the policy or in the Superintendent of Insurance Guidelines or applicable legislation. HELD: The application was granted subject to the court hearing further submissions from both parties regarding such things as whether the surplus should be paid into court or left to be administered by the applicant during the proceedings. The court found that the insurance company was entitled to some form of interpleader relief and dismissed Ag Credit’s claim to the surplus. It ordered that a representative be appointed to represent the class of insured clients in the proceedings in order to determine who was entitled to the surplus.","The ultimate issue in these proceedings is who is entitled to certain insurance premium surpluses totalling $3,552,881.00 as of October 31, 2016 plus interest accrued since. Empire Life is in possession of the funds. It claims no interest in the funds but is concerned that the claim of Ag Credit to these funds is not clear and that the rights to refund of such surplus may belong to individual borrowers of the insurer whose lives were insured over the years under the Policy and whom it views as having paid the premiums resulting in the surplus. Thus it seeks to interplead, pay the monies into court and have the Court give directions as to how the determination of ownership will be made. HELD: 1) While interpleader relief is appropriate, the appropriate form and nature of additional relief or direction is not immediately apparent. At this stage the competing claims to surplus are on the one hand Ag Credit and on the other hand Empire Life. The argument that Ag Credit collected monies from its clients for the purposes of paying their insurance premiums, had a fiduciary duty to do precisely that; the fact that the Superintendents' Guidelines governing group life insurance provided that no other person had a competing interest to the Ag Credit's right and title was unnecessary. Since no one was entitled to any portion of the surplus, it was deemed within the meaning of the Act that all monies received by Ag Credit were property of the Crown and should be paid directly to it. 2) While there has been some debate about the appropriate manner of addressing this issue, it is important that the Court have the assistance of counsel to advance the case and interests of the insured clients class.  3) The parties may conclude that it is in the interests of all parties that the funds actually remain in the hands of Empire Life, with the potential of continuing to earn interest, rather than be placed on deposit with the Court while this matter proceeds forward to final decision. If they are not able to agree, either party may bring the matter back before the court for decision. 4) While the phrase 'public money' is not found within the Act, Ag Credit would have the court determine, on this application, that it alone is entitled."

The vessel was based in Lunenburg, Nova Scotia but was in Halifax at the end of the Marblehead race.

Dismissing the appeal, that s.2(4) is a supplementary provision to guard against the methods of avoidance of the purchase tax. It is a provision which, if enacted, might well be construed as infringing upon s. 121 of the Constitution Act, 1867 which provides that 121.

The city appealed. Dismissing the appeal, that the trial judge did not commit an error in law. S.363(3) of the Halifax City Charter, under which the respondent was charged, refers to land as opposed to buildings, and cannot be interpreted to include the exterior finishes of buildings, a category already dealt with in s.363(6), which covers the unsightliness of buildings caused by neglect, not overt actions.","The respondent owned several buildings converted into apartment units.

8_1995canlii5717.txt,"The Respondent and the Applicant had a violent argument after which the Applicant and the child left the matrimonial home and moved to Transition House. The Applicant sought and obtained an emergency intervention order under The Victims of Domestic Violence Act from a Justice of the Peace giving her exclusive occupation of the matrimonial home and restraining her husband from having any contact with her or their daughter during the currency of the order. This order was then brought before a Queen's Bench Judge as required by s.5 of the Act for review. The reviewing Judge refused to confirm the order and directed a rehearing as permitted by the section. The matter then came before this Judge for the rehearing ordered. HELD: Order vacated.  1)An emergency intervention order is granted by a Justice of the Peace under s.3 of the Act without notice to the person whose conduct it restrains and without any representations from that person or on that person's behalf. It is an extraordinary remedy to be granted only where serious and urgent circumstances indicate a need for prompt action to protect the victim. 2)Absent such urgency, the application should be one for a 'victim's assistance order' brought to a Queen's Bench Judge in Chambers under s.7 in accordance with The Queen's Bench Rules. 3)In this case the domestic violence complained of occurred on January 28. There was no evidence that on February 1, 1995, Dolgopol was at risk of immediate harm. There was by then no element of urgency and the application for relief should have awaited the regular Queen's Bench Family Law Division chamber sittings.  4)The Court commented that it was unclear whether this rehearing was to proceed de novo or as a review but determined that the order should not stand in any event and therefore terminated it forthwith.","FIAT. Acting under the authority of The Victims of Domestic Violence Act, a justice of the peace madean order granting Khamseng Dolgopol exclusive occupation of the family home and a restraining order restraining him from having contact with his wife or daughter during thecurrency of the order.

The order will terminate forthwith.  2)There was by then no element of urgency and the application for relief should have awaited the regular Queen's Bench chambersings. 3)The order should have been confirmed as an order of this court, or terminated or varied in its terms."

The respondent contested that the petition for divorce was a nullity and Saskatchewan courts did not have jurisdiction to hear the divorce proceedings and lacked jurisdiction or ought to decline to exercise jurisdiction under the Children's Law Act. Both parties made serious allegations against the other and there was substantial conflict in the affidavit evidence. HELD: An order for interim custody was granted on the condition the petitioner continued to reside with his parents in Regina and that the child not be removed from Regina without further court order. 1)The respondent did not acquiesce to the child's residing in Saskatchewan such that it may be said he was habitually resident here for the purposes of the Children's Law Act.  2)The seven factors listed in s15(1)(b) are conjunctive and the petitioner must satisfy them all. With respect to (iii) a petition for divorce was commenced in July 1996. 3)The child had a real and substantial connection with Saskatchewan and it was appropriate to exercise jurisdiction pursuant to s15(1)(b). Jurisdiction existed pursuant to s15(3) as the child had a closer connection to Saskatchewan then to Alberta. Both sets of grandparents and other family members on both sides reside in Saskatchewan. The child had no connection of consequence to the Province of Alberta.,FIAT. The petitioner sought interim custody of his only child born in 1996. Section of the Divorce Act requires either spouse to have been ordinarily resident in the province for at least 1 year immediately prior to the commencement of the proceeding. HELD: 1)The child had a real and substantial connection with Saskatchewan and it was appropriate for the court to exercise jurisdiction pursuant to s.15(1)(b) as he had a closer connection to Alberta than to Alberta. 2)Interim custody was granted to the father. The evidence conflicted as one of the parties attempted to mislead the court. The other parent claimed to have resided with the petitioner after the parties separated in February 1996. In the event that there was a change in the petitioner's residence the matter was to be brought back for review. It was a condition that the child shall not be removed from the city of Regina without further order from this court.

8_2003nspc17.txt,"The defendant applied to have evidence found during a search of his premises excluded on the basis that the search warrant was invalid. Application dismissed; there was sufficient evidence to constitute reasonable and probable grounds for the issuance of the warrant. Overall the nature of the evidence was compelling with four separate and independent sources all confirming either that the defendant was selling drugs or that drugs were being sold at his residence; although individually none of the sources was of known or proven reliability, collectively they reinforced and confirmed each other; and the police conducted surveillance which corroborated the information provided by the sources.","The defendant applied for the exclusion of evidence found following a search conducted at his residence pursuant to a warrant issued by fax from the Justice of the Peace Centre in Dartmouth, N.S. The defendant argued that the information to obtain the warrant did not meet the test in R. v. Debot, [1989] 1 S.C.R. 1140, and therefore that the warrant should not have been issued; that the search was therefore warrantless, breached his Charter s. right to be free from unreasonable search and seizure, and that evidence obtained by it should be excluded under s. 24(2) of the Charter of Rights. HELD: There was sufficient reliable evidence to constitute the reasonable and probable grounds for the issuance of the warrant. The evidence was compelling and the officer did not substitute his or her view for that of the authorizing judge. There were at least three concerns to be addressed in weighing evidence relied on by the police to justify a warrantless search. 1)The nature of the evidence, over all, was compelling. Noting the progression of dates in each succeeding paragraph of the Information, accept D/Cst. Collyer's testimony, and find that the year 2001 in the penultimate paragraph was a typographical error and was intended to read 2002. So four apparently separate and independent sources over the month and a half prior to the warrant all confirmed, with varying amounts of detail, that the defendant was selling drugs or that drugs were being sold or used at his apartment, or both. There was therefore evidence on which the justice of the peace could conclude that this was continuing activity and that it was on-going at the time the warrant application was issued. The police did not seek a warrant on the basis of this information alone, but conducted surveillance, which corroborated the information provided by their sources. 2)The evidence met the standard of reasonableness. Weaknesses in one area may be compensated by strengths in the other."

The Landlord and Tenant Act s.60(5.1) empowers the Rentalsman to validate a defective service provided the notice came to the attention of the person to be served.

They also agree that the subsection is a right of first refusal clause. It is clear that the subject matter of the clause is a 'Participating Interest in the Program Land or a Project Area'. HELD: Appeal dismissed orally. The appellant relies on the words in parenthesis 'the Parties being absolutely prohibited from selling, assigning, transferring, conveying or otherwise disposing of any interest other than all of part of its Participating Interest' to establish its case that the voting agreement contravenes the terms of the joint venture agreement. However, subsection 14.01, with the words in parenthesis deleted, creates a complete right of first refusal. In our view, the words in parenthesis, rather than being intended to create substantial new contractual obligations, were intended, as is buttressed by the parenthetical structure, merely to recall to the parties their dedication of assets to the joint venture, and their inability to dispose of them qua separate assets. Thus, the phrase in parenthesis is mere surplusage in that it does not add or subtract substantively to subsection 14.01 or the joint venture agreement as a whole. Accordingly, the voting agreement is not caught by subsection 14.01.","All parties agree that this case turns on the interpretation of article XIV of the joint venture agreement, s. 14.01 of which provides that: If a party wishes to sell, assign, transfer, convey or otherwise dispose of all or part of its Participating Interest, the parties being absolutely prohibited from selling, assigning, transferring, conveying or disposing of any interest other than all of its participating Interest to establish its case that the voting agreement contravenes the terms of the Joint venture agreement.

8_2009nssc351.txt,"The action, originally filed in 2000, concerned allegations of breach of - fiduciary duty, trust, industry regulations/standards, contract; and claims of negligence and malpractice. These claims related to the actions of an investor formerly employed by the defendant. The matter had languished at a slow pace for many years. The evidence showed the plaintiffs had taken three years to reply to a demand for particulars. There was also delay when the defendant requested a change in the plaintiff's counsel (because of a conflict of interest). The defendant applied to dismiss the plaintiffs' action, claiming want of prosecution under the Rule 28.13 of the old Civil Procedure Rules (1972), and asserting it has suffered significant prejudice as a result of the delay such that it will be impossible to properly defend the claim. Application dismissed. While there has been inordinate delay (eight-and-a-half-years) attributable to the plaintiffs, the defendant is also responsible for some of the delay (another two-and-a-half-years). While the plaintiff's delay could be considered inexcusable if viewed in isolation, the defendant's contribution to the delay is not irrelevant. There were actions on the part of the defendant that could be interpreted as acquiescing to the delay. After considering the case law concerning the circumstances in which a presumption of prejudice will arise as a result of the passage of time, the court found no presumption of prejudice here. On the facts, there is not a sufficient causal connection between the delay/blameworthy conduct and the prejudice. There is a significant documentary record of the transactions. The defendant has been in contact with its former employee and could have taken the opportunity to discover him sooner. The defendant's failure to act to secure the evidence available to them at time mitigates the effects of the passage of time. While there is a possibility of some prejudice should the matter proceed, the defendant has not established it will suffer serious prejudice. Even if there was serious prejudice, the balance of convenience weighs in favour of the plaintiffs given that dismissing the action would leave them with no other recourse.","The plaintiffs filed an Originating Notice and Statement of Claim in 2000. They claimed that the defendant RBC caused them to suffer losses on investments. Two of the plaintiffs were associated in the practice of law and one of them was a solicitor of record. RBC counterclaimed for contribution and indemnity from RBC, alleging that RBC had failed to properly supervise and supervise the plaintiff's solicitor and breached its duty of care and the applicable contracts. At issue was whether RBC acquiesced to a slow tempo of litigation and whether it was entitled to a credit for the delay. HELD: The application was dismissed. 1)The delay was caused in part by the death of the original solicitor and the difficulty in locating competent counsel to advance the claim. 2)There was an inordinate delay. 3)Even allowing for two-and-a-half years of delay, this means the delay of attributable to the plaintiffs was of some eight years, which the court is satisfied is inordinate. 4)The presence or absence of RBC's actions may be relevant in determining whether the defence acquiesced in the slow pace of litigation. 5)RBC was responsible for a considerable period of delay. The delay was entirely due to the defendant's solicitor's negligence and the plaintiff himself was blameless. It might be unjust to deprive him of the chance of recovering the damages to which he could otherwise be entitled. 6)Excessive delay is not excusable. The Court must take into consideration the position of the plaintiff and strike a balance between the parties."

The respondent failed to show that, on balance, an action is the preferable route. While not all of the witnesses will be ascertained quickly, the important ones can be, which is all that Rule 6.03(5)(a) requires. The hearing should be predictable in scope and length and ready to be heard within months. The issues are straightforward. The only thing that would cause delay is the intended counterclaim.","Applicants, Peter Boone and Loren Bough, seek to convert some $2.5 million of debentures issued by the respondent to Medusa Medical Technologies Inc. (MEDusa) into an action. Boone and Bough are taking steps to attempt to secure payment of their debenteures by means of an application to this Court. Medusa has commenced a separate action for damages against them. At issue is whether the respondent can quickly ascertain who their important witnesses will be; if so, what action will be taken. In any event, the respondent will have its costs on the motion to convert as it failed to satisfy the Court on a balance of probabilities that an application was not appropriate. At the same time, the moving party, Medusa, has failed to meet its burden of proving the proposition on a balanced of probabilities. HELD: The application is dismissed.  1) Rule 6.03(5) provides a number of factors which can go long way to make future events more predictable and more certain. 2) The affidavit evidence in this regard, as provided by both parties, is sketchy and speculative. There is a dearth of detail on the evidence, especially the witnesses the parties would introduce. This is a prime case for determining whether the parties can be ready to be heard in months rather than years. The issue that will necessarily drag the proceedings to years is the intended counterclaim by Medusa for as yet undeterminable, possible or potential economic losses allegedly caused by the Respondent's enforcement application."
8_2015skqb144.txt,"The court concluded that the respondent was not a credible, trustworthy, or reliable witness for many reasons. The petitioner, on the other hand, was found to be a truthful and reliable witness. The court was also impressed with the petitioner’s witnesses because they were close family members, long-time friends, and her live-in partner. By contrast, the respondent’s witnesses were friends seen from time to time, neighbours, and his mother. The court found the respondent’s mother to be evasive and guarded at times. To determine custody the court reviewed the factors set out in s. 8 of The Children’s Law Act, 1997. The petitioner was found to be the primary parent of the child since his birth. The court was left with a degree of uncertainty as to the day-to-day activities of the child when he was with the respondent. The quality of the child’s relationship with the petitioner was found to substantially exceed that of the respondent’s relationship with the child. The court accepted that the child said disturbing things upon his return to the petitioner from the respondent. The child’s need for a stable, reassuring, and positive home were found to be met in the petitioner’s home. The court indicated that decreasing the respondent’s time with the child may ameliorate the adverse effect on the child’s emotional needs. The child was also found to be afforded more social fulfillment in the petitioner’s care. The petitioner also had more constructive plans for the child’s future. The respondent’s negativity towards the petitioner was found to negatively impact his ability to parent. The court concluded that it was in the child’s best interests to primarily reside with the petitioner. The petitioner was granted sole custody of the child so as to minimize further conflict between the parties. The respondent was given unsupervised access every other weekend. The court added $5,000 to the petitioner’s line 150 income for the personal component of her vehicle expense deduction. After determining the respondent’s income the court found that the s. 3 Guideline child support due by the respondent to the petitioner was $676 per month and that he should be responsible for 37 percent of the s. 7 expenses. The petitioner did not request child support but instead asked the court to consider it in the distribution of property. The respondent discharged the onus of establishing a common-law relationship of two or more years. The respondent’s pension value available for division was found to be $11,663.97.  The court did not find an extraordinary circumstance to warrant an unequal division of the family home. The value of the home was $360,000. The court used the date of application to determine the amount owing on the home. The petitioner also had rental properties and was given an exemption of $90,641.43 for those properties. After taking into consideration all of the property and exemptions, the respondent failed to prove that he was entitled to any distribution under The Family Property Act. The petitioner did not claim an equalization payment. Costs were awarded to the petitioner and the respondent was restricted from bringing a further court application until those costs were paid.","HELD: The petitioner was granted joint custody with the mother with primary residence with the father and access for the mother. The parties had separated in November 2012. The petitioner filed an Answer and Counter-Petition in January 2013 contesting the respondent's claims for sole custody, specified and supervised parenting time, the request for restraining order and costs. The respondent counter-petitioned claiming division of property under the Family Property Act, S 1997, C-8.2, joint custody of Z. and S. to be with the wife and child support for the father set aside for 6 months. The interim agreement provided that the parties would have Z. in the interim care of the mother and that the respondent would receive parenting time. The mother was to have her own home. The father was to pay child support and the parties had been unable to communicate for several months. HELD: 1)The mother was concerned that the father was holding her from her and that she needed to end the relationship. She telephoned the respondent the next morning principally to try and get the child back. 2)The father was in constant pain. He would not allow the mother to sleep in his bed. He was verbally abusive, calling the petitioner names and calling her names. 3)All communication went through their lawyers. 4)The parties followed the interim orders of December 2012 and February 2013. The pre-trial conference was directed that the parents would have access on a shared week-on-week basis. If the mother was unable to attend, the father would be required to abridge time and to deal with service issues. 5)There was nothing wrong with the state of mind but the concern that this was holding the child from the petitioner was real. It is not uncommon for a father to make threats to his children in an effort to get them to sleep with him. The administration of justice is based on the principles of fairness, equity and justice."
8_2017skqb249.txt,"HELD: The application for leave to appeal was dismissed. The court found that a term permitting an appeal from an arbitrator’s decision on an error of law did not fall into the category of the obvious and was not the same as an implied term, such as that of good workmanship in contracts for repair. The contractual language used by the parties was clear that they intended to resolve disputes by final and binding arbitration. Even if it had found that the parties had not contracted out of s. 45(2) of the Act, the application for leave would have been dismissed because the proposed grounds of appeal did not raise a pure issue of law.","HAL applied for leave to appeal the decision of an arbitration panel. The arbitration panel was constituted to resolve a commercial contractual dispute between HAL and SecurTek. The dispute concerned the exclusive right to market, licence and distribute HAL's products in Canada. The parties entered into three separate contracts in 2008. The contracts each provided that any disputes which could not be resolved by the parties would be settled by binding arbitration. The respondent took the position that if it failed to sell 25 licences, it simply lost the right to exclusive distribution, rather than being obligated to pay HAL for 25 licences regardless of how many were sold. HELD: The application was dismissed. The provisions of the agreement exclude the right of appeal on questions of law, pursuant to s. 45(2) of the Act. The application could not proceed because the agreements contained an implied condition that allowed the parties to appeal an arbitrators' decision on a question of law. Such an implied term is not akin, for instance, to the implied term of good faith in contractual negotiation, or the term of reasonable notice of termination in contracts of employment, and if there is a contrary intention on the part of either party, it cannot be taken to abrogated its right to appeal."
8_2018skqb217.txt,"HELD: The application was granted. The judgment was set aside and the defendant given leave to file its statement of defence. The court found that the judgment should be set aside as a matter of right because it was in excess of the amount due. The judgment was also set aside on the merits. It found that the time between service of the statement of claim and the default judgment was not sufficiently long to prevent the defendant from defending the action. As well, the defendant had provided an arguable defence to the claim in that it pled in its proposed defence of non-compliance with s. 2(3)(b) of the Indian Act. The delay had not caused the plaintiff irreparable harm.","Civil Procedure – Default Judgment – AppealHELD: Pursuant to Rule 10-13 of The Queen's Bench Rules, Key's counsel applies to set aside the default judgment and seeks leave to file a defence. The plaintiff obtained default judgment against the defendant, The Key First Nation, totalling $102,703.62 plus costs assessed at $1,598.50. The default judgment was set aside on the basis that Sollows' counsel failed to exercise its authority to bind the plaintiff at a meeting of the governing body. The Court cannot accept that a time frame of 28 days is sufficiently long for the court to prevent the plaintiff from defending the action. That is only 7 days past the date S.H. was permitted to note the action for default. Given that Key's then counsel responded to the action soon after default was entered, this delay in defending the actions is insufficient to deny the plaintiff its day in court."

Awarding 5 months interest, that the date from which interest is calculated in this type of action is upon completion of the appeal process. An appropriate interest claim under s. 41(I) therefore only exists for the five month period between the Court of Appeal's assessment determination and the refund of the property tax five months later.","The plaintiff municipal tax payer paid its property taxes as assessed for the years 1994, 1995, 1996 and 1997 but on appeal was held entitled to a refund for each of the three years in the total of $420,177.13. The defendant earned interest on this money from the time of receipt or had the use of these monies.  The plaintiff sought interest pursuant to s. 41(i) of the Judicature Act, supra on the refund from the date it made the overpayments in response to HRM's tax invoices requiring payment of those amounts on the due dates. The Nova Scotia Court of Appeal upheld the reduced assessment and the plaintiff was awarded interest on the principal amount for the five month period between the hearing of the assessment determination in March 1997 and the payment of the property tax refund in September 1997 as well as on the unpaid interest until the date of judgment. The plaintiff appealed the dismissed assessment and was awarded a partial refund of the overpayment of taxes in September and October 1997. At the end of the process, the assessment was reduced and this had the ramification of an overpayment when the taxes were recalculated. Canada Trust was entitled to compensation for the deprivation.  1)No interest claim was authorized, either directly or indirectly, by the Assessment Act supra and even the refund of taxes cannot be paid until the disposition of the appeal. 2)An interest rate of 8.75% being a rate equatable to the interest rate charged by HRM on overdue taxes (prime plus 4.75) was an appropriate rate on all of the 3 years in a row.  3)There was no cause of action for return of any over payment of taxes until after the appeal provisions of the Assessment act, supra had been exhausted. The date from which interest is awarded as judgment for overpayment was March 3, 1997 to the date the tax payments were remitted because the appeal process has concluded.  4)Costs were awarded to the plaintiff on the basis of the partial refund.

In issue was whether the assessor erred in law by misconstruing or misapplying the provisions of the Assessment Manual in determining the MAF for the appellant's shopping centre properties by using a single sale to calculate the MAF; and by creating as a commercial building neighbourhood the grouping of fully enclosed shopping centres which encompassed the entire city. HELD: 1)The assessment was set aside and the matter was remitted to the assessor to be dealt with according to the manual. Both issues were dealt with in Cadillac Fairview v. Saskatoon (TWL CA00074) and the same reasoning applied. 2)The appellant conceded that the question of whether the various expansions of the shopping centre resulted in abnormal functional economic obsolescence was a question of mixed law and fact and was thus beyond the scope of this appeal. 3)The second branch of the appeal was dismissed. Whether the committee erred in law by saying the definition of functional obsolescence did not apply to an add-on type of construction was beside the point since that was not the ground for the decision. The decision was not the result of any wrong interpretation of the manual but was the result of the appellant's failure to establish to the committee's satisfaction the facts on which it based its case. The decision was therefore beyond the Court of Appeal's jurisdiction to review.  4)There was no order as to costs as success was divided.","This appeal was taken under s. 33.1 of The Municipal Board Act.

As with all other fully enclosed shopping centres in Saskatoon, the assessor calculated MAF of 0.94 for the mall. 2) In this case, the appellant only raised two issues: 1) Did the assessment Appeals Committee erred in law by concluding that functional obsolescence does not apply to an add-on type of construction or by finding that there must be an inability of an improvement to perform the function for which it is used? Or, to put it another way, it was decided on the evidence or lack thereof. 3) The decision was arrived at not as a result of any wrong interpretation of the manual but because of the failure to establish to the satisfaction of the committee the facts on which it based its case."

The confrontation between the accused and the complainant was one continuing episodic event and the complainant's actions were provoked by the accused. However, no causal relationship was shown between the blows of the accused and the broken nose sustained by the complainant. There were too many variables and probabilities as to how the complainant's nose might have become broken.","Six persons shared an upstairs apartment. The complainant was the boyfriend of another tenant. The parties invited some guests to the apartment for a sociable and convivial evening together. The accused, who had invited the complainant to join them in the basement, struck the complainant in the face. HELD: The accused was convicted of assault causing bodily harm. The Court found that the accused cannot rely on the Criminal Code s.34(1) for his defence. It only affords self defence in cases of aggression. He must not have intended to cause grievous bodily harm and he must have used no more force than is necessary to protect himself. In this case, the assault by the complainant was anticipated by the accused. He did not strike the initial blow with the intention of hurting the complainant and without any justification. There was no evidence to support the proposition that without justification the accused provoked the assault upon himself."

The s. 7 expenses claimed by the petitioner include dental work of $112.90 for Kristen, orthodontic work for Brina and costs associated with Brina's post-secondary education. It is uncontroverted that Brina has disabilities that necessitate certain tools such as a computer for her to be successful in her post-secondary training. HELD: 1) The respondent accepts responsibility for his proportionate share of the girls' dental and orthodontic expenses and there shall be an order accordingly. 2) The September 2004 consent order provided that computer repairs and equipment were included in Brina's s. 7 expenses. Accordingly the costs relating to the computer are legitimate s. 7 costs. 2) The crisis prevention class was a reasonable expense incurred on Brina's part and will assist her with her future plans. 3) The Zeller's supplies would normally be covered under the Table support and that expense is disallowed. 4) Brina's s. 7 post-secondary expenses are $7,123.72 and include tuition, crisis prevention class and books, required university books, bus pass, black cartridge for the printer, Shaw internet, Microsoft licence, computer repairs and updated virus protection.","FIAT: The petitioner applies to have arrears fixed with regard to s. expenses related to her daughter's post-secondary education and in addition requests that the amount to be fixed for the ongoing s. 7 expenses be specified. HELD: 1) The respondent has not paid any s.7 expenses since Justice Dickson's September 23, 2004 order. In addition to ongoing support for the parties' oldest child, Corry and his current income for child support purposes is $74,500 gross per annum and in the fall and spring terms his annual income is $1,865.94. In September 2005, Justice R. S. Smith terminated the respondent's obligation to pay support for his oldest child and ordered him to pay 66% of the s. costs. In October 2005, the petitioner claimed for 2003/2004 s.6 expenses. That application was dismissed as it pre-dates Justice Wilkinson's order for the 2006/2007 university year.  2) The petitioner also requests the amount of ongoing s7 expenses be fixed. The respondent accepts responsibility for his proportionate share of the girls' dental and orthodontic expenses. It is uncontroverted that Brina has disabilities which necessitate certain tools such as computer and internet access. Accordingly, the crisis prevention class was a reasonable expense incurred by the petitioner's part and will assist her in her future plans. The Zellers supplies, however, would normally be covered under the Table support and that expense was disallowed. 3) The s7 post- secondary education expenses for the 2005/2006 year are calculated as follows:University of Saskatchewan fall and winter terms, $960.94, University of Regina books, $401.09 x 2) 3,002.60, Bus pass (fall and spring semesters) and $609 per month commencing August 1, 2004, computer repairs 100.00 and computer extracurricular activities of $110.90.

9_2007skqb98.txt,"The appellants were found guilty of breaching a rural municipal bylaw which provides 'That no poultry or livestock be permitted in districts zoned Hamlet [sic].' There were four grounds of appeal: 1) an application to admit new evidence on appeal; 2) a constitutional challenge seeking a declaration that the bylaw was ultra vires for uncertainty; 3) the significance of the word 'hamlet' in the bylaw; and 4) the meaning of the word 'livestock' in the bylaw. HELD: The appeal is dismissed. 1) New evidence will not be admitted on an appeal if, by due diligence, it could have been adduced at trial. Further, new evidence will be admitted only if it bears upon a decisive or potentially decisive issue in the trial. Neither of these requirements is met. 2) The constitutional challenge is not properly before the Court as notice is required when the constitutionality of a bylaw is impugned. In any event, the uncertainty on which the appellants rely in attacking the bylaw does not exist. 3) The appellants misunderstand the use of the word 'hamlet' in the bylaw. 4) Whatever definition of 'livestock' is used, the definition always includes cattle.","At a June 2, 2006 trial in Provincial Court, the appellants were found guilty of breaching a bylaw of the Rural Municipality of Vanscoy No.345. The trial justice convicted them of breaching Bylaw 2-1995, which provides that no poultry or livestock be permitted in districts zoned hamlet. The appellants did not lead evidence at trial. They did not dispute that they were keeping cattle on their property. Their defence related to points of law. HELD: The application to admit new evidence was dismissed. 1)The appellants had not given notice under the Constitutional Questions Act. Notice is required when the constitutionality of bylaw is questioned. In any event, the uncertainty on which they rely in attacking the bylaw does not exist. Assuming it could be proven, the references to proposed amendments in the letter would not establish that there had been any amendments. Further, the proposed amendments relate to the basic planning statement, not to the zoning bylaw or to the Bylaw under which they were convicted.  2)There was no basis on the trial decision based on the argument the three bylaws were tendered do not bear upon a decisive or potentially decisive issue at trial since the use of the word 'hamlet' does not refer to a particular type of livestock. The word 'livestock' is uncertain and can be defined so broadly as to be either meaningless or unenforceable."
9_2008nssc18.txt,"The defendant council, charged with the general oversight and administration of matters under the Natural Products Marketing Act, delegated certain authority to commodity boards such as the plaintiff. The plaintiff requested that the defendant hold a show cause hearing to determine whether certain producers had contravened their licence but when a procedural breakdown occurred as to how that hearing would be conducted, with the plaintiff seeking and being denied an adjournment, the hearing was held without the plaintiff's participation. The plaintiff brought an application for mandamus to compel the defendant to hold a new hearing and filed two affidavits providing some detail and background information as to its reasoning for its failure to attend the hearing and the parties' differing positions regarding their respective roles in the application of the management plan. The defendant brought an application to strike certain of the affidavits filed by the plaintiff on the basis that they were an attempt to put evidence to the court on matters not forming part of the record. Application to strike affidavits dismissed; the Rules do not preclude the admission of affidavits on an application and, in the present circumstances, reason and fairness militated against ruling the affidavits inadmissible. There was no authority for denying the parties the use of affidavits should this application proceed as a jurisdictional dispute and, should it proceed by way of an error of law on the face of the record, the affidavits were also admissible to complete the record.","The applicant Board applied for an order pursuant to the Civil Procedure Rules 14.25(1) and 38.11 to strike the affidavits of Sonya Lorette, dated January 22nd, 2007 and February 9th, 2007 as an attempt to put evidence to the Court on matters not in or forming part of the Record of the Council Panel in its adjudicative setting. The Attorney General and the Board had refused to appear at the hearing because their request for adjournment had been denied. At that hearing, the Board requested the Council to hold a'show cause' hearing. After making that request there was a procedural breakdown between the Board and Council regarding how that hearing would proceed, with the result that the Merks license was not suspended. The hearing then was held as scheduled without the participation of the Board. The decision was appealed. Allowing the application and ordering a new hearing, that there must in fact be a real dispute and that affidavit evidence is not admissible on an application for certiorari. When it is granted on the ground of want of jurisdiction or error of law on the face of the record it is admissible. Affidavits were always admissible to show the record was incomplete, as for instance that a conviction omitted the evidence of one of the witnesses. Similarly with the application involving the interpretation of the law the positions taken by the parties in the past number of years were said to be irrelevant. In the context of the marketing scheme as intended by the Legislature it cannot survive without the assurance that fairness and equity will prevail among the producers and all the others who are represented on this interlocutory dispute. This is a jurisdictional dispute. The issues to be determined are whether there was an ongoing and clear dispute between the parties and whether the Council has delegated authority to the applicant Board to suspend and deal with licenses and whether certain authority is delegated to the various boards, specifically, the Turkey Marketing Board. In this case the applicant board made its decision that the applicant's license to produce turkeys had been contravened and that their license should be suspended. At page 178 of his decision, he reviewed all the materials in the file including the imputed affidavits as well as affidavits. The application made subsequent to the hearing raised questions of jurisdiction. He reviewed various factors supporting his conclusion that the applications by the Board should not be struck on the basis that no cause of action had been disclosed."
9_2013skca85.txt,"The respondent mother applied to lift the stay of execution imposed by Court of Appeal Rule 15(1) when the appellant father appealed the trial judge's decision to award custody of the parties' son to the mother with the child to have access to the father for one extended weekend per month during the school year (see: 2013 SKQB 212). The trial judge had found that both parties had exhibited a lack of interest in their child and there was little to distinguish either of them as the better custodial parent. As the mother had facilitated the father's access to the child and he had not demonstrated the same willingness and that the most important relationship in the child's life was with his sister, who resides with the mother, the trial judge found that it was in the child's best interest to foster that relationship and grant custody to the mother. HELD: The Court granted the application. There would be no harm to the child if the stay was lifted. The father was directed to perfect his appeal and the stay of proceedings arising from Court of Appeal Rule 15(4) was also lifted.","The applicant mother sought a lifting of the stay of execution on the judgment of the trial judge (indexed as 2013 SKQB 212 (CanLII)) which was automatically imposed upon the father's appeal from that decision. HELD: The application was granted and the stay was lifted in accordance with the factors set out in s. 8(a)(i) of the Children's Law Act. It was not possible to conclude that the child could be bonded or attached to either of his parents in any meaningful way. The child was essentially abandoned by both his parents from the time he was a toddler until he was 10 or 11 years old. The father's seeming inability to facilitate the child's access to his mother and his sister, especially where access has been ordered by the court, is of considerable concern. It is in the best interests of the child that he be placed in the custody of his mother.  1) The child is to have his access time with the father for the remainder of August. The mother acknowledged this to be the case. 2) There are two important factors which lead the court to the conclusion that it will be in the children's best interests if the stay were lifted. The first is the issue of access. Clifton had not bothered to have any involvement with the child since he was an infant. Even after that he has been resistant to any reasonable compromise offered by Danita. He is trained as a truck driver and has been employed in that capacity for several years. The decision to quit his employment to assist with child care was reasonable at the time but it cannot continue indefinitely. Danita is the parent who is better able to understand and facilitate this need in the child’s best interests. The second factor is access. The trial judge had no confidence that the father would facilitate access to the child as he had repeatedly failed to do so in the past. Neither had any particular attribute that would tip the balance in favour of the father. Both were equally at fault for neglecting and ignoring the child for most of his life. The evidence before her was not much supplemented by the materials submitted in respect of the within application."

The defence took the position that Lienaux had placed himself in the position of a witness who may be cross-examined.

b_1997canlii11375.txt,"The plaintiff, a specialty seed marketing company, claimed damages from the defendant for an alleged breach of contract. Johnson Seeds entered contracts with growers prior to the seeding and harvesting to secure product for resale. After extended negotiations the defendant eventually signed and mailed the standard form contract but never received an executed copy. The price of the canary seed escalated substantially during 1993. The defendant thought that as he did not have a copy of the contract signed by the plaintiff it was not a valid contract and sold the seed to a third party for more than double the contract price. HELD: Johnson Seeds was awarded judgment for $50,850.05 and pre-judgment interest together with costs of the action. 1)There was a valid contract between the parties. Damages were assessed as of January 1994 when Johnson Seeds knew that the defendant was in breach of the contract. 2)The issue was whether communication by delivery of the fully executed contract was necessary to complete the contract. The parties communicated by fax, mail and telephone. There was no doubt that the defendant verbally confirmed that a contract did exist. Discussions prior to May 1993 were pre-contractual negotiations. 3)Johnson Seed knew that it was prepared to pay 10 cents only if delivery occurred after January 1/94. The formal contract did not expressly set forth these conditions. Both parties knew these terms were absent when they executed the contract but both considered that they had a legally binding contract in 1993.  4)Farr took a calculated risk and sold the seed which alleviated his immediate cash-flow problem. Johnson Seeds waited until the last possible day under the written contract terms to call the contract in an effort to position itself to claim increased damages for breach of contract.","The plaintiff Seeds claims damages from the defendant for an alleged breach of contract. The plaintiff Seeds purchases specialty crops from producers and contracts with purchasers, including other traders or packagers, for the resale of these specialty crops. To secure the product for resale, the plaintiff entered into contracts with growers prior to the seeding and harvesting of the same. The contract stipulated that the plaintiff should receive a fully executed copy of the contract by January 2, 1994. The defendant attempts to have matching contracts for the quantum of specialty crops required with various producers with options for differing times of delivery to match the demand of the purchaser and to meet the delivery date requirements in the sales contracts. HELD: 1)The plaintiff had verbally confirmed on at least two occasions that he did have a contract with Johnson Seeds and at all times the defendant confirmed that such a contract did exist. 2)There was a valid contract between the plaintiff and Johnson Seeds. In the instant case the contract was signed in person, by telephone, by fax and by mail. 3)Although it may have been in the reasonable contemplation of the plaintiff that he would receive back a fully formed copy of a contract, there was no doubt that in the telephone conversations he had with the defendant in November and December 1993, he verbally confirmed that a contract existed. 4)Johnson Seeds knew that it had a binding and legally enforceable contract and it was important that it be clearly stated in the contract. 5)In all discussions prior to May 1993 the plaintiff had used the mail to communicate the offer to the defendant. The post office was legitimate agent of Johnson Seeds for the purpose of communicating the acceptance of the offer and confirmed that it was a contract. 6)The defendant knew that the formal written contract (signed by both parties in May 1993 and in November 1993) was an instrument to revoke the offer. 7)It was incumbent on the plaintiff to insist that this term be expressly stated in his contract. Whether the plaintiff took calculated risk and sold the canary seed was an issue."
b_1999canlii13927.txt,"The issue was whether it was appropriate for the court to require the accused to commence the trial by calling evidence on a Charter voir dire, where the accused gave notice of a Charter application. This would differ from the usual procedure, wherein the Crown commences the trial by calling its witnesses in the trial proper, and thereafter the accused applies for leave to apply the Crown evidence to the Charter application, where it is appropriate, in addition to calling other defence evidence on the application.HELD: In R. v. Kutynec, the court made the following determinations: 1) whatever procedures are used should not unnecessarily interfere with the inherent jurisdiction of the trial judge to control the conduct of the trial; 2) instead of creating procedures for Charter applications in provincial court, it is better to leave judges the discretion to determine matters such as sufficiency of notice and the extent of the offer of proof; 3) counsel should give timely notice to the Crown of the Charter issue, and at trial, the accused should be able to state with reasonable particularity the grounds upon which the application is made; 4) objections to admissibility of evidence must be made before or when the evidence is proffered; 5) the onus is on the accused to demonstrate on a balance of probabilities that he or she is entitled to a Charter remedy; 6) the trial judge should insist defence counsel state his or her position on possible Charter issues, either before or at the outset of the trial; 7) failing timely notice, a trial judge is entitled to refuse an application to assert a Charter remedy; 8) fairness may require the accused be given some latitude to explore potential Charter issues which he or she had no opportunity to develop prior to trial; and 9) the trial judge must control the proceedings to ensure this legitimate exploration does not become a fishing expedition. In R. v. Loveman, the court said the trial judge must ensure fairness and preserve the integrity of the trial process. This may require a judge to refuse to hear a motion where insufficient notice has been given, even when the motion involves an application to exclude evidence under s. 24 of the Charter. In R. v. Habhab, the court was asked to consider a procedure which involved entering into voir dire at the start of the trial and the Crown proceeding to lead their evidence at the outset regarding the Charter application and substantive issue. The court dismissed this proposal and stated that the case law implies it is the accused's obligation to lead the evidence on the voir dire. The court was not able to justify the proposed procedure. If the authorities imply there is an obligation on the accused to call evidence first on the Charter voir dire, this can occur by the application of some or all the evidence which is already on the record on the substantive issues. The admissibility of evidence can be reserved by the court pending judgment on the Charter and any s. 24 remedy. An advantage of having the Crown evidence on record at the outset is it removes uncertainty as to the nature of the testimony as it relates to the Charter application. This is preferable to the accused calling the Crown witness at the outset on the voir dire, discovering aspects of the evidence are contrary or unfavourable, and then having to convince the court to grant leave to cross-examine. It avoids a scenario where the Crown witness evidence is led by the defence on the voir dire, and then the accused must impeach the creditability of this witness in cross-examination as it relates to the proof of the substantive issues. The court concluded the fairness of the proceedings and public confidence in the administration of justice, were best served by the Crown first leading its evidence on the charge alleged and the accused having leave to request the evidence be applied to the Charter issue, if appropriate.","The issue was whether it was appropriate for the Court to require the accused to commence the trial by calling evidence on a Charter voir dire, where the accused has given notice of a Charter application. This would differ from the procedure which is usually utilized, wherein the Crown commences the trial in the trial proper and thereafter the accused applies to the court for leave to apply the Crown evidence to the Charter application, where it is appropriate to do so, and in addition to calling other defence evidence on the application. HELD: The application for exclusion was dismissed.  1)It is in the interest of conducting an orderly trial that the trial judge is entitled to insist and should insist that defence counsel state his or her position on possible Charter issues, either before or at the outset of the trial. All issues of notice to the Crown and sufficiency of disclosure can be sorted out at that time.  2)This can quite properly occur by the application of some or all of the evidence which is already before the court and on the record on the substantive issues. The admissibility of that evidence can be reserved by the Court pending the determination of the Charter issue on its merits and the application for s.24 remedy, if any. 3)There will be instances where defence counsel will be reluctant to foreclose an inquiry into an alleged violation. There will, however, be circumstances where no less severe order will prevent unfairness and maintain the integrity of the process. 4)In light of these observations and what has been said in the cases, one cannot see any justification for the procedure presently proposed."
b_2002nspc32.txt,"The accused was charged with operating a vehicle when his blood alcohol level exceeded the prescribed limit and impaired driving. After being involved in an accident, the accused was taken to hospital where a blood demand was given and eventually acceded to. The accused challenged the validity of the blood demand and argued that his right to counsel was violated. Accused guilty of operating a vehicle when his blood alcohol level exceeded the prescribed limit; there was no violation of the accused's right to counsel. The officer had valid grounds to make the demand, having been advised that the accused was in an accident, that someone had said the accused was either high or intoxicated, having smelled a mild odour of alcohol on the accused and the accused having advised him that he only had three beer. Even if the accused's claim to amnesia for all the events around that time was believed, there was no medical evidence to suggest that he could not understand what the officer said to him at the hospital. Although his degree of alertness may have fluctuated, he displayed an understanding of the situation by showing appropriate concern for how much he had been drinking and asking questions which showed an understanding of his situation and what speaking to counsel would entail.","The defendant was charged under s. 253(b) of the Criminal Code with operating a motor vehicle when his blood alcohol level exceeded the prescribed limit. He was charged with impaired driving and driving over the legal limit. Witnesses testified that the defendant lost control of his vehicle as he rounded a curve at the top of a hill in Victoria County, Nova Scotia. The defendant was the lone occupant and had two bottles of gas at the scene when he was struck. He claimed to have had three beers in the car at the time of the demand. The officer testified that he smelled liquor on the defendant's breath and he thought it might be coming from his head. The defence argued that this was sufficient proof to warrant a blood demand. HELD: The accused was granted his s. 10(v) Charter rights at a time when he could appreciate and appreciate the rights of others and gave an informed waiver as that is understood from R. v. Clarkson and subsequent cases.  1) The accused demonstrated an understanding of his situation through words and actions spanning a significant period of time. 2) While his degree of alertness may have been fluctuating, his emotions were unstable and he appeared to have some recollection of hitting the shoulder of the road and losing control. 3) There was no evidence of mechanical defects or failures in his vehicle.  4) Although the accused's mental state during the time the officer assumed some control over his situation, he must be possessed of sufficient information to allow him or her to make an informed choice as regards exercising the right.  5) There is no evidence that the accused drank alcohol in the final five minutes of his visit at his uncle's house. The evidence tends to show that the drinking took place throughout that one-half hour period. It is not an appropriate concern for how much he had been drinking. The medical technician at the RCMP Forensic Laboratory gave expert opinion evidence that concentrations of Bromazepam and Cervical Deprivation were twice the average therapeutic level.  6) The Court found no error in the trial judge's interpretation of the import of s.10(b)."
b_2002skpc50.txt,"An application for a DNA warrant on the basis s.487.05 (the general warrant provision) of the Criminal Code with respect to DNA warrants does not refer to a form. The applicant suggested a tape recording would avoid the potential problems in bringing the application before a Provincial Court Judge. HELD: These concerns were raised in the January 21 decision concerning potential prejudicial or negative effects, which outweigh any requirement to swear the Information before a judge. An oath taken before a commissioner or notary is as valid as it is before a provincial court judge and avoids all the possible problems that relate to personal attendance. The intention is to make protocol work as flexible as possible, not impeding the police in their legitimate role, while making sure the court maintains its independence. Form 5.01 is specifically set out in the Code. Section 487.1 does not have a form, but even if it did and used the same words 'taken before me', that would elevate form over substance in a significant way.","An application for a DNA warrant was made by the prosecutor and, pursuant to the Code, was accordingly directed that the courtroom be cleared. The applicant had asked that the officer be allowed to swear the Information to Obtain the Search Warrant. The officer had sworn the Information on the application in camera and the courtroom was cleared. Before the application was dealt with, there was an application with respect to a search warrant, which ought to be made in camera. The court was able to direct the courtroom to be cleared and people could come back in. The application if the sworn Information is delivered or faxed in secure way to the judge and then the judge can immediately deal with it and not have the officer come and appear at all and swear it. The purpose of this application was to make the protocol work in as flexible a fashion as it can, not impeding the police in their legitimate role but making sure the court maintains its independence. The reasons for this application are: 1)It seems that the better practice is to put as much as you can in the Information and to deal with Informations except in emergency situations as provided for in the protocol. 2)The applicant's request that the information be sworn before the judge elevates form over substance in the context of the concerns raised about the potential prejudicial or negative effects of a personal attendance by the judge. It's not practical for the court to ask the question whether there is any more truth in the officer's affidavit of Information because he swore it before a provincial judge or a Notary Public."

She also sought removal of a clause which provided for the discontinuation of support if the husband's professional income dropped below $80,000. The parties had been married for approximately thirty years and had one child, who was now independent. Application dismissed; the parties' current circumstances did not constitute a significant departure from the range of reasonable outcomes anticipated by the parties when the Agreement was signed. Both parties' income had increased since the divorce and the wife was not deeply in debt, as she alleged; there was no pressure exerted and no oppression during the course of negotiations; the Spousal Support Advisory Guidelines are not law and allow for exceptions to the general formulas provided, one such exception being the assumption of debt by one of the parties (the husband in this case); the spousal support figure recognized the husband's reasonable expectation of retirement and the fact that he was experiencing health problems; it was completely foreseeable at the time that the Agreement was signed that, given the wife's age, she might experience difficulty in finding employment in her narrow field; the subsequent increased value of one of the husband's properties was not a reason to vary the spousal support provisions of the Agreement.","The applicant applied to vary spousal support provisions of the Corollary Relief Judgment. Although the parties were married for over 29 years prior to their separation, the divorce settlement was made into an agreement incorporating the terms of that agreement. The applicant found that there had been no material change in the circumstances of either of the parties since it was signed and that the respondent did not take advantage of any vulnerability as contemplated by the Supreme Court in Miglin (supra). HELD: The application was dismissed with costs. 1)The Agreement was sound when signed and there have been no changes in circumstances. The parties agreed to be bound by the provisions of this Agreement. There was no pressure exerted upon the applicant and no oppression during the course of the negotiations or the signing of the Agreement and the rental income more than covered the mortgage payment. 2)There was no evidence of coersion or anything of that nature. The agreement was designed to avoid future court proceedings. Retirement was contemplated by both parties and by the Respondent in particular and the Agreement was designed with retirement in mind. 3)The agreement was not unconscionable. The mere presence of vulnerabilities will not justify the court's intervention. The degree of professional assistance received by the parties will often overcome any systemic imbalances between the parties. The rental income was surpassed by the portion of household expenses which were borne by the applicant. 4)There were no adverse impacts on the applicant's earning capacity following the separation as she had the assistance of very experienced counsel and financial advice.  5)The applicant was to demonstrate that the agreement was no longer in substantial compliance with the objectives of the Divorce Act. The court was to look at all of the evidence and determine whether one party took advantage of the vulnerability of the other."
b_2007nsca75.txt,"A single vehicle accident occurred when the driver swerved to avoid hitting a dog that ran onto the highway. An action was brought against both the driver and the farmer who owned the land on both sides of the highway on the basis that the farmer owned the dog in question and was negligent in failing to keep it off the highway. The farmer contended that although he owned a dog, it was tied to a tree at the time and his was not the dog that had run onto the highway. When his application for summary judgment was dismissed, the farmer appealed. Appeal dismissed. At this stage of the proceedings, it was not necessary for the plaintiffs to prove that the defendant's dog contributed to the accident or the truth of the statements and evidence attached to the affidavit. It was only necessary to show that the facts were contested, there was some evidence to support their version of events and, if their evidence was accepted by the trier of fact, their action had some merit. Although the judge appeared to blur the two parts of the test on a summary judgment application, the Court found that the farmer failed to meet the first part of the test; namely, that there was no genuine issue of fact for trial as there was conflicting evidence as to the identity of the dog involved.","The defendant was found to have exceeded the threshold on the test for granting summary judgment. The chambers judge dismissed the application, finding that the defendant had met the burden placed upon him in the application by failing to establish that there was a genuine issue of fact. The issues on appeal were whether the chambers judge erred in admitting and relying on the affidavit of the plaintiff's lawyer, whether he properly accepted and accepted the exhibits attached to the affidavit, and if so, if there was any credibility issue to be determined at trial."
b_2010nssc125.txt,"The plaintiff bus driver was in a serious bus/motor vehicle accident that killed two people. He was charged with dangerous driving. His employer offered the services of its lawyer, who eventually transferred the file to the defendant who represented him at trial. At trial, the Crown introduced a video of a purported accident re-enactment. The defendant chose not to object to its admission, saying he felt it was a perfect example of the Crown's 'doomed to failure' theory. As for the problems (it was recorded in the daytime, while the accident happened at daybreak; it assumed the vehicle that was struck was stopped, although there was no proof it was; and it didn't show all of the vehicles at the original scene), he felt these could be addressed by cross-examination. The plaintiff was convicted. He retained a different lawyer to represent him on appeal, and won. Eventually, the charges were dropped. The lawyer's competence was not raised as an issue on appeal. In their decision, the Court of Appeal criticized him for not objecting to the admission of the video and other evidence. They found this evidence was inadmissible, highly prejudicial and should never have been put to the jury. The plaintiff sued in negligence and breach of contract. The parties introduced conflicting opinions from criminal law experts to support their respective positions. Action dismissed. The standard of care is that of a reasonably competent lawyer. Lawyers make strategic decisions and exercise judgment, but are not responsible to ensure a certain result. Sometimes the decisions are wrong: it is only negligence if it was outside the realm of acceptable possibilities in the circumstances of the case. The appeal panel had the benefit of hindsight - it is improper to judge the plaintiff's actions in light of their conclusions. While the experts were not helpful in establishing what a reasonably competent lawyer (as opposed to a specialist in the field) would do, their differing opinions illustrate how the admissibility of evidence can be the subject of much debate.","The plaintiff was charged with dangerous driving causing death. Following the laying of criminal charges, the plaintiff's employer suspended him from work without pay. They offered at their expense the use of their legal counsel to defend him in relation to the criminal charges. The plaintiff argued that the Crown's theory of the accident was fatally flawed and that there was a clear conflict of interest between the plaintiff and his employers. HELD: The appeal was allowed and his conviction was quashed and a new trial ordered. 1)The court found that the trial judge erred when he failed to strike the offending evidence, in allowing into evidence the opinion of the RCMP Traffic Analyst, the videotape re-enactment and the related still photographs. These photographs did not prove anything so it was not necessary for the defendant to object to their admission. 2)There was a lot to be gained by having the expert's report admitted into evidence. The evidence should not have been introduced by the Crown, nor should counsel have referred to the theory in summation. Defence counsel should have raised a timely objection. It would have been reasonable exercise of judgment if the video and the other photos were not admissible as they were not being introduced at the criminal trial for this purpose. The decision of the Court to exclude the video evidence and the R.C.M.P. analyst's opinion was based on a factual foundation which was not supported by the evidence. 3)There were a number of problems with the Constable's report. First, all of the calculations assumed that the Chrysler was stopped prior to the collision. The second, and more importantly, the stationary Chrysler theory, was not accepted by the jury. 4)The Court found that reasonably competent counsel acting for the plaintiff should have made timely objections."
b_2010skqb343.txt,"A class action was certificated at Queen's Bench on the basis of breaches of The Consumer Protection Act and a breach of duty of care. The defendants were granted leave from the Court of Appeal to appeal the portion of the certification order dealing with alleged breaches of The Consumer Protection Act only. The certification on the basis of duty of care was upheld. As a result, a situation existed where the class action process could continue on only part of the claim until the appeal of consumer protection act issues was heard. HELD: Rule 15 of The Court of Appeal Rules is engaged and the entire certification judgment is stayed pending the disposition of the appeal. If the plaintiffs wish to apply to lift the stay they must do so to a judge of the Court of Appeal.","The defendant plaintiffs sought leave to appeal the certification order of the Consumer Protection Act (CPA) pursuant to s. 39(3)(a) of the Class Actions Act. The order and judgment certified the within action as a class action. The defendants applied to leave the matter to move forward concurrently with the appeal on the CPA cause of action. A conference call was convened to address the issue of the next steps that should be taken. A decision on the leave application was rendered on August 26, 2010 and the matter was now before the Court of Appeal. The plaintiffs requested a conference call and were given the opportunity to speak to the effect of whether it was appropriate to move the matter forward at this time given that there is currently an appeal pending on only one aspect of the certiff order. HELD: 1)Leave was granted to appeal. Steps can now be taken to move this matter forward concurrently as the appeal is ongoing. Steps must be taken in the context of the current situation. 2)The situation that now exists is that the class action will definitely advance, although, until after the appeal concerning the CAA causes of action is finally determined, it is not known whether the class actions will proceed on the basis of one cause of actions or two. Steps are now open to the plaintiffs. 3)The plaintiffs sought to stay the action pending the appeal of the CAPA certification order on the entire portion of the order that related to alleged breaches of the consumer protection act, S.S. 1996, c. C-30.1 (the CPA) were dismissed. 4)The matter had been pending for some time and it was now appropriate to proceed. The matter had now been finalized and a decision had been rendered on whether the matter should proceed concurrently.

b_2011skpc30.txt,"The accused was charged with impaired care and control of a motor vehicle and care and control of a motor vehicle while his blood alcohol level exceeded .08. The accused was found in the driver's side of a vehicle with his legs near the pedals. His body was slumped over into the passenger side. The vehicle had collided with a power pole and sustained significant damage. The engine was running when the police arrived. There was no one else in the vehicle. The accused was transported to hospital where the doctor suspected he had a brain bleed and recommended the police obtain a blood warrant. The officer who swore the Information to Obtain the warrant indicated that the interior of the vehicle smelled strongly of beverage alcohol and the accused smelled of beverage alcohol. The Justice of the Peace did not sign the Information to Obtain. The issues before the Court were whether there had been a breach of the accused's s. 8 right to be free from unreasonable search and seizure and whether the Crown had proven beyond a reasonable doubt that the accused was in care and control of the motor vehicle. HELD: The blood warrant was found to be invalid, meaning that the blood samples were obtained as part of a warrantless search in breach of s. 8. The Information to Obtain the blood warrant did not depose that the officer believed the accused was the driver of the vehicle which had crashed into the power pole or that the accused was in care and control of the motor vehicle. The officer should have included information about the accused's position in the vehicle and that the accused was unconscious. Without this information, the Information to Obtain did not contain reasonable grounds to believe that the accused had committed an offence under s. 253 of the Criminal Code. However, the blood sample evidence was admitted after a s. 24(2) analysis. The Court held that the officer was acting in good faith and that he honestly held the belief that the accused was drinking and driving when he swore the Information to Obtain. The impact on the accused was technical in nature and did not seriously undermine the accused's rights. The Court held that the truth seeking function of the trial process would be better served by admission of the Certificate of Analysis. The Court found that the accused was in care and control of the motor vehicle at the time of the collision. There was no evidence that anyone else was in the vehicle and the position of the accused when discovered suggested he had been driving the vehicle. The accused was found guilty of driving while his blood alcohol level exceeded .08. The Court held that his blood alcohol level was between 236 mgs% and 283 mgs%.","At the beginning of the trial, the Crown and the accused obtained a warrant to search for blood samples from a Justice of the Peace. The warrant specified that the blood samples were authorized to be taken between the hours of 1:22 o’clock a.m. and 5:22 am. The accused’s blood alcohol concentration at the time of the accident was.08. At trial, Crown and accused agreed that the accused should testify on voir dire for the purpose of the court making its determination of the validity of the warrant and the admissibility of the Certificate of Analyst. The purpose of this hearing was to determine whether the information contained in the information to Obtain constituted reasonable grounds for the belief that the person who had been driving the vehicle had committed an offence under s. 253 and was involved in an accident resulting in a brain bleed. HELD: 1) The information which the officer had deposed in the Information To Obtain was not sufficient to support the warrant. Further, the officer did not depose that the driver of the vehicle (who was not wearing a seat belt) was in good condition to consent to the taking of samples of his blood. 2) The Certificate of Analysis was not required to be admitted into evidence. The officer had to provide sufficient detail so as to permit the justice of justice to determine that reasonable grounds exist for the warrant to issue.  3) The officer did omit a crucial ground for his belief, namely that the vehicle smelled strongly of beverage alcohol. 4) The oath sworn by the officer was not a valid form of affidavit. The oath must be assessed against the 'totality' test, looking to the whole information and excising any misleading parts. 5) Blood samples taken from the accused constituted breach of his s. 8 rights pursuant to s. 24(2) of the Charter respecting the violation of s.8 rights of the accused as guaranteed by s.7 Charter of Rights. 6) In this case the officer swore his information to obtain, when reviewed as a whole, to ensure the justice would still assess the adequacy of the information and be free from unreasonable search and seizure."
b_2016skqb297.txt,"HELD: The court found that both parties were significantly involved in the day-to-day parenting of the children such that a conclusion that one parent or the other was the primary caregiver could not be made. The court also found that the respondent responded positively and appropriately to the petitioner’s concerns regarding masturbation and pornography. The respondent indicated that he had not watched pornography since December 2014 and that software on his cell phone and computer provide assurances that he had not watched pornography to the petitioner. The petitioner did not dispute that evidence. The court could not reasonably give weight to the petitioner’s opinion evidence regarding the respondent’s alleged addictions. The court listed numerous problems with the petitioner’s evidence of addiction. The court was unable to conclude that there was a risk of harm to the children caused by the respondent. With respect to the petitioner’s allegation of the respondent’s anger management problem, most of the incidents were dated. The respondent had since taken anger management counselling, accepted that he suffers from ADD, and began taking medication for ADD. The court held that it was in the best interests of the children to continue to reside in the family home and that it would not be in their best interests for one parent to be classified as or be the primary parent. It was also in the children’s best interests that their parenting be shared on an equal basis. A nesting arrangement was found to be in the best interests of the children. The court ordered that the parties would have joint custody of the children and each party had exclusive possession of the family home when they were enjoying their assigned periods of parenting. The parents would alternate weeks living in the family home with the children.","FIAT: The petitioner application for an order granting her exclusive possession of the family home, primary residence of the children and supervised access only for the respondent father. Although no reasons were given on the granting of the interim exclusive possession order, the petitioner raised concerns that the respondent had anger management problems that made her and their daughters fearful of him and addictions to pornography and masturbation that made it impossible for them to continue to reside in the same home. The respondent takes the position that this order should not have been granted in the circumstances of this case. HELD: 1) The evidence from the outset indicates that the petitioner wants the relationship to end and that increased contact between the respondent and the children would in fact be to their benefit. 2) The petitioner's evidence that there was a recurring theme that the girls only wanted to put the children to bed with the respondent was unreliable. 3) The respondent was significantly involved in his daughters' lives, well beyond the level of many or most fathers who have normal work commitments. There was no basis to draw the inference that he was addicted to pornography or that he masturbated in the presence of his children. 4) The Court considered all of the allegations with care and caution. The petitioner had provided factual evidence as background to her opinion, much of it expressly disputed by the respondent or implicitly acknowledged by him, that evidence relates to significantly dated matters. The onus is on parents who seek to restrict maximum contact to satisfy the court that there is good reason to restrict contact. The certainty that the children will suffer the loss of a normal relationship with a loving father is high on the list of factors to be considered. 5) Counsel for the petitioner was not entitled to give weight to the allegations as they were not statements of fact. The Court reviewed the factors that led her to conclude they were unreliable and therefore should not be granted priority. 6) There was insufficient evidence to conclude the respondent's repeated complaints of addictions, pornography, and masturbation constituted an unreasonable risk of harm to the children. The evidence did not support the conclusion he was prone to obsessive compulsive behaviour. 7) The court was unable to conclude there was anything to be taken from the incident that showed any improper behaviour on the part of the respondent. 8) Counsel provided appropriate reasons for the Court to err on the side of caution, whether or not a proper evidentiary foundation has been established, and should strive to make a proper assessment of the risk going forward."
c_1993canlii3443.txt,"This was an appeal of a decision which denied variation of a maintenance award where a lump sum had been previously ordered. The judge determined that since the respondent had paid the lump sum, his obligations were terminated; therefore, the Family Court did not have jurisdiction to hear the application. Allowing the appeal and returning the matter to the Family Court, that orders for child support made under the Family Maintenance Act do not have the finality which they did under other previous legislation. The order is always subject to variation in appropriate circumstances. Accordingly, the Family Court has jurisdiction to vary awards of lump sum child support made pursuant to the Family Maintenance Act.",This was an appeal from a decision of Family Court Judge Levy. Levy held that a lump sum payment made under the Family Maintenance Act could be varied after payment. The issue was whether an order for the payment of maintenance or expenses or respecting care and custody or access and visiting privileges was subject to variation. The parties were entitled to know as soon as possible what their decision would be.

Under the existing order the children's primary residence was with their Father. A custody investigation conducted in 1990 when the mother had first commenced this application had recommended that the existing arrangement be continued. The Father now intended, however, to move with the children to Ontario to take additional education. HELD: Application dismissed. 1)The Judge found that the move to Ontario was a sufficient change of circumstances to permit a variation application to proceed. She therefore proceeded to consider if the move was in the best interests of the children. 2)The Judge reviewed recent authorities from across Canada dealing with whether a custodial parent should be permitted to move with the children. 3)In the circumstances of this case the Judge was convinced that the move was reasonable and was not motivated by any desire on the part of the Father to thwart the Mother's access.","This was an application for an order varying the judgment of Dickson J. of the 5th of January 1990 in which he gave judgment for divorce and joint custody to the parents of two boys born April 22, 1984 and June 3, 1986. The mother had moved from Ontario to Saskatchewan, taking the boys with her. The parties had entered into a separation agreement in 1988 in which the father agreed to joint custody, residence with the mother and generous access to the mother. In 1989 the mother commenced an application to vary the judgment by granting the father sole custody of the boys, or joint custody with principal residence with mother. The father opposed the move. He argued that it would be in the best interests of the children to have them uprooted from their home in Melfort and move to a virtual paradise in Aurora. HELD: 1)The father was granted sole custody with generous access.  2)The mother's application was not brought as an application under the Divorce Act s.1(6) as it had not been made before.  3)Once again, the mother was granted a detailed description of the circumstances leading to the application for variation of access. 4)Because of the generous access the mother had, it was reasonable to think that an incident of custody included the determination by the custodial parent of where the parent and child shall live and provisions for possible access in Hawaii. 5)The move was to thwart the mother's wishes to move. The nature of the relationship between the child and the access parent will always be of importance. The closer the relationship and the more dependent the child is on it for his or her emotional well-being and development, the more likely an injury resulting from the proposed move will be. 6)The distance of the move was not an issue."

When his federal government management position was declared redundant, the applicant received a retiring allowance of $75,646 in May 1997. The respondent opposed the application on the basis there had been no change in circumstances since the judgment was granted; she had no other income than the support payments and child tax credit; alternatively, there were special provisions in the parties' separation agreement which would permit the court to award an amount that differs from the amount prescribed by the Guidelines.HELD: 1)The judgment the applicant sought to vary was made after the coming into force of the Guidelines. It did not however include a determination of child support made in accordance with the Guidelines. There was no change in the childrens' or mother's circumstances. The applicant was unemployed but was still benefiting from his retiring allowance at the time of the order which he no longer enjoyed.

c_1999skqb178.txt,"Custody, child support and division of matrimonial property were in dispute. The mother was awarded interim custody of the three children in 1997. The father was ordered to pay child support of $405 per month but had made only one voluntary payment of $100. He agreed to abandon his appeal of the order for sale of the matrimonial home. He had been unable to obtain financing to buy out her share. The father, unrepresented by counsel, sought to have selected portions of 14 hours of taped telephone conversations with the children and wife admitted into evidence. He insisted the tapes were of central importance to his case; that they discredited the conclusions of the custody and access report and demonstrated abuse was occurring in the mother's home. HELD: 1)Sole custody was awarded to the mother. The father was to have access Friday from 5:00 p.m. until Tuesday at 9:00 every second weekend. 2)The tapes were admitted in their totality, unedited. The two lines of cases respecting the admission of audiotapes in a custody hearing were reviewed. The tapes had the opposite effect to the father's intent. The father 'alternatively interrogated the children about their mother; prompted them to make unfavourable comments about her; magnified every incident of childish squabbling into a crisis; magnified the children's distress over the marital breakdown, encouraged the children to run to his home at every opportunity; and generally undermined the mother's parental authority at every available turn.' The petitioner's depression had been ascribed to environmental stresses rather than innate. The father acknowledged that his drinking had lessened but not discontinued as he suggested in the custody and access report. 3)The property was to be sold. The father was responsible for mortgage payments from July 1998 until the date of sale as he had stopped making mortgage payments after the previous order while continuing to reside in the home. A corresponding adjustment in the net sale proceeds was to be made in the wife's favour. Child maintenance was to be satisfied from the father's share of the sale proceeds. 4)The mother's employment pension was to be divided equally and one half rolled into an RRSP designated by the father. RRSP's were to be divided equally. Furniture, furnishings and personal effects in their possession would be retained by each party. Hunting clothes or supplies and one half of the family photographs were to be returned to the father. The loan from the respondent's mother was statute-barred. No repayments had been made in 10 years. The debt for the half ton acquired after separation was the father's sole responsibility. 5)The prior order of $405 for child support remained in effect. The father made no income disclosure until trial and evidence of his 1991 income was unsatisfactory. Rental income was deemed to his 1998 income. No order was made for day care costs due to inadequate proof. The parties could seek a review if more comprehensive evidence were produced. 6)Judgment for divorce would be made final on the expiration of 31 days.","Although custody was the most conspicuous issue in the proceeding, there were also questions of child support and division of matrimonial property that required resolution before the parties could put an end to their acrimonious marital breakdown.

HELD: The tapes were admitted to their entirety and went in unedited.  1) Although the mother's recognition of past problems with depression and her progress in dealing with it through medication and counselling, the father was insistent that the tapes were of central importance to his case and that they discredited the conclusions of the custody and access report and demonstrated the abuse that was occurring in the mother’s home.  2) The tapes had the opposite effect of revealing the true character and motivations of the father and shedding little light on the mother. They spoke volumes about the father”s character, motivations, and psychological well-being and demonstrated his need to “grow up and realize the children are the biggest thing in his life”. 3) The father had no redeeming excuse for such calculated, offensive and immature behaviour. He had exploited the parents’ unhappiness at every turn and incited and encouraged willful and unruly behaviour to suit his own purposes. The parties’ hostility towards one another during the course of the relationship was palpable and it was difficult for the father to maintain a reasonable distance from his children. The evidence gathered by the mother was that the parties were in aprotracted pattern of dysfunctional, conflictual communication and that the father would always be there to rescue the children. Over time, the tapes became a source of frustration and anger for both parties. It was difficult to describe the tone and content of the tapes without lapsing into cynicism and disbelief."

He was entitled to a judgment for fees paid by the plaintiff to the credit of Q.B.G. 639 of 1999. 3)$2,521.68 and any further amounts due and owing from SPPC to the defendant were to be paid into Court and disposed of as the court may direct in full satisfaction of SPMc's obligations to the various parties who may have a claim against the money.  4)$3,827.53 was paid into the two files by Tapp in person and counsel for the Minister of Labour.

Dismissing the appeal, that the appellant did not apply the wrong test in applying the curative provision in s.686(1)(b)(iii) of the Code. In fact, he was satisfied that the admission into evidence of an audiotape of a confrontation between the appellant and the complainant was the product of warrantless search.

The first language of the respondent mother and the child is Inuktitut. The child, born in 1993, lived with the mother in Nunavut until 1999, when he moved to Nova Scotia to be with the father by agreement of both parties. This arrangement was not to exceed one year unless agreed to by the mother. Determining that the courts in both Nunavut and Nova Scotia have jurisdiction to deal with the issue of custody, that it was in the best interests of the child to remain in Nova Scotia and for the custody hearing to be held in Nova Scotia.","The parties were the natural parents of a son born in 1992 in Cape Dorset, Nunavut. In November 1999, the Court issued an order that it would take jurisdiction and hear the application under S. 18 of the Family Maintenance Act. The problem had been with translation services and obtaining a translator in Nova Scotia. The mother had been very angry at the father and had taken him outside, placed him on the ground and punched him until friends intervened. This took some time to arrange and complete and during this period the child had remained in NovaSC. HELD: Custody was granted to the father. He had to spend considerable time with his father to retain ties with her and his Inuit culture. The paramount consideration of what is in the best interest of the child would require the Court to consider this as one of the factors to determine custody."

The court accepted the evidence of the accused where there was a discrepancy between the testimony of the officer and the accused. The mental element of the offence of refusal consists of intentional non-compliance. The officer in his conversation with another officer said he could not understand why he was not getting a proper sample. There was a reasonable doubt that the officer did understand why he was not getting a proper sample and could not provide the accused with adequate instructions.,"The accused was charged with failing to comply with a demand to provide a sample of his breath by a peace officer pursuant to s. 254(2)(a) of the Criminal Code to enable proper analysis of my breath to be made by means of an approved screening device. The accused argued that he was not intentionally trying to avoid providing an adequate sample. He was attempting to supply sample as directed by the officer. HELD: The accused was found guilty. 1)The officer's lack of cander in giving his testimony in this regard has raised doubts in the mind as to his forthrightness in respect to other important details.  2)Where there is a discrepancy between the testimony of the officer and that of the accused, the court accept the evidence. The officer said he stopped the second test as the accused was blowing outside the mouthpiece again. He turned on the instrument. He waited for the ready light to come on. He got an imbalance signal from the machine. He stopped the first test and blew. He blew three times in all. 3)The mental element of the offence of refusal created by s.254(5) consists of intentional non-compliance. There was no reason the accused could not have been more cooperative and more than adequate instructions to provide proper sample. 4)It was possible for the accused to have reasonable excuse to refuse the breath sample. The only reason he could not be more cooperative was that there were three or four phone calls during the night."
c_2004nsca135.txt,"The appellant was convicted of sexual assault, with the only live issue at trial being whether the Crown had proved the absence of the complainant's consent beyond a reasonable doubt. Appeal dismissed; the judge's reasons disclosed that he applied the reasonable doubt standard to the evidence as a whole; although the reasons for judgment were very brief and open to criticism, they did not preclude meaningful appellate review. The test for legal error in a judge alone case is not the same as would apply to a judge's charge to a jury on the issue of reasonable doubt. It was not an error for the judge to assess the credibility of the appellant in relation to that of the complainant as long as he went on to take the next step, as he did in his 'short-hand reference' to the evidence.","A cocaine fuelled encounter between the appellant and the woman with whom he was living resulted in his conviction for assault and sexual assault. He appealed the conviction submitting that it was unreasonable, was based on misapplication of the burden of proof and that the judge's reasons were so deficient as to constitute an error of law.

Both parties appealed the asset division; in the process, both parties sought to introduce fresh evidence. The wife also questioned the level of assistance offered by the trial judge to the husband who was self-represented at trial. Appeal and cross-appeal dismissed with the exception that the wife is to be given immediate access to her personal belongings; both applications to introduce fresh evidence dismissed; on the sparse record before him, the trial judge did not err in his division of assets and did not offer the husband unwarranted assistance as a self- represented litigant. Faced with two competing claims as to the amount of the proceeds of sale, if any, of one of the parties' properties, the trial judge committed no error in finding the amount owed to be half-way between the two claims and then setting it off against the amount owed to the other party.","The wife sought a more favourable division of assets and an entitlement to health insurance. The respondent husband also sought to have the matrimonial property divided equally. The trial judge found that this evidence was either readily available at trial, irrelevant, or both. The parties had separated in 2001 and the wife filed for divorce in Nova Scotia. The primary contest related to the disposition of the 'camp property' and its sale by the respondent husband centred on the idea that the respondent had overstated the purchase price of the property. HELD: The appeal and the cross-appeal were dismissed without costs. 1)Both parties were self-represented litigants in an emotionally charged conflict and it would not be proper for the court to admit fresh evidence on the day of the appeal. 2)The court found no palpable or overriding error in the standard of review and the test for admission of fresh evidence was set out by the Supreme Court of Canada in Palmer v. The Queen (1979). 3)The parties were awarded three separate properties, all located in Guysborough County, Nova Scotia and together with three separate parcels of land. 4)The respondent husband was awarded one of two loans from family friends. The other was a joint loan given to a friend of the husband's that he could seek to collect. 5)The wife's equalization claim of $25,250 was equivalent to approximately $35,000 Cdn. The court found that both parties were entitled to share in the value of the assets held by them. 6)It is not the role of the Court to exercise de novo trial functions for the consideration of evidence which was available for the trial. The overriding consideration must be in the words of the enactment 'the interests of justice'. The Court would not permit any witness by simply repudiating or changing his trial evidence to reopen trials at will to the general detriment of the administration of justice."
c_2005nsca7.txt,"The defendant obtained a tender to bank, blend and load coal at the plaintiff's coal preparation plant. In performing the contract, the defendant experienced equipment problems resulting in the plaintiff having to rent other equipment. The plaintiff terminated the contract without any prior warning or notice to the defendant and brought an action for reimbursement of monies advanced under the contract and expenses incurred for the equipment rentals. The defendant counter-claimed for damages arising out of the termination of the contract, for services performed under the contract and for extras which had not been paid. The court found that the plaintiff was entitled to reimbursement for overpayments and equipment rentals and that the defendant was entitled to fair and reasonable compensation for extras for which the court awarded the sum of $10,000. Both parties were found to be in breach of the contract, the plaintiff's breach occurring because the volumes of coal supplied did not approximate the tonnages represented in the contractual documents. The clause excluding liability for errors in the forecast did not excuse the plaintiff because the actual volumes were not even approximate to the forecasted tonnages and the rates bid by the defendant were directly related to the anticipated tonnages. Absent evidence as to how the plaintiff arrived at the information used in the calculation of the forecasted tonnages, no negligent misrepresentation could be found, as there was no evidence that the information was negligently obtained. Both parties appealed. Appeal and cross-appeal dismissed; the trial judge's finding that the defendant had fundamentally breached its contractual obligations which entitled the plaintiff to terminate the contract without notice should not be disturbed; thus, the trial judge did not err in awarding the plaintiff damages for the defendant's breach of contract. The defendant did not establish that the plaintiff had been negligent in making the tonnage estimates and thus, the judge did not err in dismissing the defendant's claim for negligent misrepresentation. Although the trial judge found that the plaintiff had also committed a fundamental breach of the contract (in failing to provide the approximate tonnages referred to in the contract), the defendant had not chosen to terminate the contract and the plaintiff's breach did not undermine its right to terminate the contract as a result of the defendant's breach.","The plaintiff entered into a contract with the defendant to provide banking, blending and lifting of coal at its coal preparation plant. The defendant was the successful bidder and the contract was terminated by the defendant in March 1986. The plaintiff sued for damages including loss of profits, increased effort, costs and expenses beyond that contemplated in the contract, and breach of contract including wrongful termination. Awarding the defendant $270,307.05 in damages, that the defendant's breach of the contract would have given the defendant the right to terminate the contract without notice and that it was not entitled to rely on the exclusion from liability provisions in it. Further, the defendant cross-appealed, arguing that the trial judge erred in finding that the contract breached and that the breach entitled it to terminate. At issue was whether the defendant was entitled to fair and reasonable compensation under the contract or negligent misstatement. HELD: The appeal was dismissed with costs to the plaintiff in the amount of $30,000 to be awarded.  1)The defendant failed to establish that the plaintiff would have been able to perform the contract if the defendant had performed the contract and provided the approximate tonnages. 2)The plaintiff did not have sufficient standby equipment and personnel on each shift to load coal from the various stockpiles at the plant until their depletion. 3)There was no loss in profits arising as a result of defendant's termination. The court distinguished between the plaintiff's and defendant's breaches of contract and found that defendant could not rely on exclusion of liability clauses relating to their estimates."

Costs awarded in the amount of $5,000 plus disbursements; although the hearing was less than 2 hours in length, there were a number of steps taken prior to the application, including two days of discovery examination.","The plaintiff brought an application to strike pleadings and for summary judgment on the basis that mere intentions, negotiations, etc., and pleadings of a cause of action failed to create one. There was no tariff that provides direction with respect to the determination of the amount of costs in Chambers' applications.

In many applications where the results bring finality, the court has utilized Tariff A.

c_2005skpc55.txt,"The plaintiff student argues that she was unjustly dismissed and so sues the defendant business for wages that she would have earned had she worked to the end of the term of her employment. The employer argues that the plaintiff was dismissed for cause. HELD: 1) The employer spoke to the employee on three occasions about her work and by his own admission, the employee made an effort to improve. At no time was she advised in any detail what was expected of her and that a failure to meet a particular standard could result in the termination of her employment. It would appear that the employer attributed the misfiling of a paper in an income tax return to the plaintiff and he decided to summarily dismiss her. In the circumstance, it can not be said that it is more probable than not that the plaintiff was guilty of serious misconduct or a breach of a fundamental nature respecting office policies, policies that may not have been made known to her, that there was just cause for her dismissal. Therefore the defendant was dismissed without just cause.  2) The contract of employment was a term contract extending from May to August 31, 2004. The plaintiff was dismissed on July 12. But for her dismissal, she would have worked for the rest of July and for the month of August or 36 days. 3) In this case the plaintiff made reasonable effort to seek and maintain employment. She earned $657.83. 4) The plaintiff is awarded judgment in the amount of $2,083.73.","The plaintiff sought wages that she would have received if she had worked to the end of her employment. The defendant, which operated a business and sold investments, argued that the plaintiff was dismissed for just cause. The plaintiff had received employment applications in the local newspaper in the amount of $2,592.00 and she had received days of training as receptionist. HELD: The application for the position of summer student was dismissed and the defendant dismissed the plaintiff. The court found that the contract of employment extended from May 10th to August 31, 2004 and that the dismissal would have occurred if the plaintiff had not been dismissed on July 12th. She claimed that no notice of termination had been provided to her and that she had been advised that she was to receive a 'certificate in office automation or administration' from the defendant. The certificate of dismissal was not provided to the plaintiff and, therefore, there was just cause for dismissal."

The plaintiff claims general and aggravated damages of $5,000 for these injuries. Both the plaintiff and the defendant were elected to their positions. The plaintiff is a councillor. The defendant determined that the plaintiff was in a conflict of interest and asked the plaintiff to remove himself from the Chambers pursuant to s. 45(1) of The Rural Municipality Act. There was a further determination by the defendant that the plaintiff had misrepresented his situation to the council. The defendant then prepared a letter to the plaintiff in which she advised that until such time as he apologized to council and remedied the 'deficiencies' that created the conflict of interest he would not be recognized by the chair to speak or to move motions. HELD: The claim is dismissed. 1) Even if the defendant's decision did infringe on the plaintiff's Charter right to expression to some limited extent and could not be upheld pursuant to the section of The Rural Municipality Act (the Court made no conclusions as to which of the competing legal opinions is right) the Court was not prepared to award damages to the plaintiff pursuant to s. 24(1) of the Charter. While the plaintiff's decision might have been politically advantageous to her and her supporters in council, it was not without some justification because the plaintiff was in breach of the Building Bylaw, there could be a perceived conflict of interest, and the Reeve did have some evidence before her that the plaintiff had misrepresented his situation to council. The Court was not prepared to award damages to the plaintiff so he could gain a personal benefit from a limitation which only had a small effect on his right to represent his constituents. The dispute between the parties is a political one. A court should be reluctant to get involved. 2) With regard to the tort of misfeance in public office, even if the defendant acted without lawful authority in imposing the sanctions in order to be actionable, the defendant had to be aware that her conduct was unlawful. This requirement has not been met. The defendant was acting on legal advice from legal counsel to the municipality. There is no evidence, nor even the suggestion, that legal counsel did not act in good faith in providing advice to the defendant. As a result, the plaintiff has failed to establish that the defendant acted with knowledge she had no legal authority to do what she did in imposing sanctions on the plaintiff. 3) With respect to the tort of negligence, the Court found that because the defendant was acting on the advice of legal counsel when imposing the sanctions upon the plaintiff, she has not breached the standard of care. Her actions were not negligent.","The plaintiff alleged the defendant has injured his reputation and feelings, and caused him humiliation, distress, and humiliation through her actions as Reeve of the Rural Municipality of Sherwood.

c_2006skqb335.txt,"FIAT: The former vice-president of the Saskatchewan Labour Relations Board commenced an action for damages alleging wrongful conduct by the Government of Saskatchewan. He alleges his term was not renewed through the influence of certain unions with the Department of Labour. He participated in an interview where he suggested that the Department of Labour required members of the Board to read the newsletter of the Saskatchewan Federation of Labour. When Wal-Mart became aware of these circumstances, it filed this application. Wal-Mart alleges the Board is biased or, at the very least, there is justification for a reasonable apprehension of bias against Wal- Mart. It argues that the only way to rectify the situation is to prohibit the Board from holding hearings involving Wal-Mart. The Union applies pursuant to Rule 319 of the Queen's Bench Rules to strike almost all the material filed by Wal-Mart. HELD: The application of Wal-Mart is dismissed. The Union will have taxable costs, but only of the application by Wal-Mart and the Union's application to strike the material filed.  1) The affidavit filed by Wal-Mart swears that the affiant has 'personal knowledge of the facts and matters herein deposed to' and then he goes on to swear that various exhibits are attached to his affidavit. This achieves nothing more than compel the court to examine the exhibits to determine their admissibility. The affiant does nothing more than provide copies of 27 documents. 2) There is no necessity for the admission of the documents. There is no basis upon which to conclude that it is necessary to accept the proffered documents as evidence.  3) It is alleged there was interference with the Board and that it was required to read publications which were highly disparaging of Wal-Mart. Yet there is absolutely no evidence before the court to prove the allegations. Many newsletters contain negative comments about Wal-Mart. However, there is no admissible evidence to prove that these newsletters were provided to the Board, or that any member actually read them. Mr. Matkowski has not come forward to assert his allegations under oath. Without such evidence, it is impossible to conclude that bias exists within the Saskatchewan Labour Relations Board or that there is justification for a reasonable apprehension of bias. To conclude otherwise, this court would be acting on pure conjecture or fantasy. That is not good enough.","FIAT: Wal-Mart is seeking an order pursuant to Queen's Bench Rule 664 and Rule 673 prohibiting the Saskatchewan Labour Relations Board as presently constituted from hearing and/or making any orders involving it or until further order of this Honourable Court. The application of the Union seeks an order striking and removing virtually all of the material filed in support of the application. In the other motion the union applies for an order dismissing the application by the applicant. HELD: 1) The relief sought by the Union should be granted and the application brought by the defendant corporation should be dismissed. Although there is no admissible evidence before the court, believe my account is accurate. 2) The affidavits of the former vice-chairperson Walter Matkowski with 39 exhibits are admissible. There is no necessity for their admission. Mr. Matkowski is around and about. He must be available to swear an affidavit. The critical allegations originate with him. Absent any explanation for his absence, there was no basis upon which to conclude that it is necessary to accept the proferred documents as evidence. At no time have the allegations been tested for accuracy and truthfulness. In reality, contradictions are found within the very documents. It is argued that the only way to rectify the situation is to prohibit the Board from holding hearings which involve him. The documents meet neither requirement. 3) Matkowski's affidavit is not sworn. It must be admissible by reason of s. The Saskatchewan Evidence Act, S.S.C.J. No. 1253. 4) The transcript of the radio broadcast attests that he prepared the broadcast. That does nothing more than prove he performed the task. It says nothing about the accuracy, truth or reliability of what is contained in the transcript. 5) The admissibility of the affidavits and the transcript of a radio broadcast is of no real interest to the Court as it does not disclose any special information about the members of the Board. The transcript is attached to an affidavit of one Ryan Kraikas who attests to preparing the broadcast and that he did nothing other than report the interference by the Department of Labour with the Saskatchewan Federation of Labour. 6) The portions of an article from the Regina Leader-Post and the Star-Phoenix were not required reading. 7) The defendant corporation filed an application to strike, remove and replace the transcript with an unsigned draft affidavit. 8) The statements of claim filed by the plaintiff corporation against WalMart and the union together with copies of three newspaper articles were admissible but"

She made her proposal in 2000, and completed it in 2005 and was no further ahead. Another five years have passed. To expect them to pay in a shorter period would be too long.

c_2012nspc18.txt,"The accused was charged with numerous weapons-related offences, including possession and trafficking. The police had intercepted numerous ambiguous calls between the accused and others and had interpreted the coded language used as involving discussions about firearms. The defence had been unsuccessful in arguing that the inferences drawn were mere hunches and the conversations could not support a reasonable inference that the subjects under discussion were firearms. A search at his parents' residence had resulted in the seizure of several firearms but none were found in the accused's actual possession. One of the issues was whether the accused had constructive or joint possession of the firearms seized from his parents. Accused found guilty on all the weapons' possession charges and some of the trafficking charges, but not guilty of careless storage of a firearm. It was clear that the accused had much more than a passive or quiescent knowledge of the guns seized from his parents' home and there were a number of indicators that he had a measure of control over them, such as his telling his father on occasion to get rid of them, his being notified immediately when one of the firearms went missing, the way he pressed his parents to explain how that could happen and his ability on other occasions to tell his father where in the home a particular firearm was located. However, despite his knowledge of the location of some of the firearms at certain times, the court was unable to find that the accused had stored the firearms in the manner they were found when the search warrant was executed. The evidence also established that he was stashing guns at locations other than his residence and he possessed those guns for the purpose of transferring them to others. The only reasonable inference to be drawn from the intercepts was that the speakers were talking about guns and the communications revealed the commercial nature of the accused's activities. Given that the accused had asserted a privacy interest with respect to an application to exclude the evidence arising from the police search of the cell phone seized from him, he could not now deny that the phone was his.","The accused was charged with possession of a prohibited firearm and possession of ammunition contrary to s. 8 of the Criminal Code and possession with the intent to carry out a prohibited act. The evidence in relation to the firearms seized from the accused was that of a sawed off Cooey 84 shotgun, a Lakefield Mark II rifle and ammunition, in a careless manner (contrary to Criminal Code s. 86(1) x 3)) and of having constructive and/or joint possession of the firearms at the accused's father's residence. The intercepts were also of significant importance to the firearm trafficking charges. The accused was convicted of possession for the purpose of trafficking firearms. The Court was unable to accept that the accused can assert a privacy interest in order to obtain protection of s.8 of the Charter and then, when that application goes badly and the evidence is admitted, turn around and claim to be a stranger to the item in which the privacy interest resided."
c_2015skca77.txt,The court denied leave to appeal. The applicant’s proposed grounds of appeal were not questions of law but of fact.,"The defendant company appealed the Small Claims trial which found that the defendant had breached the contract but that the plaintiff had failed to mitigate its damages when, on June 2, it had declined the opportunity to finish seeding the Knudsen land. The trial judge awarded damages in the amount of only $1,575, being the profit that would have been lost in relation to the 70-100 acres which had already been seeded when the defendant extended his offer. HELD: Leave to appeal was denied. 1)Leave to appeal should not be granted to the defendant company. 2)The trial judge did nothing improper in this regard. He merely attempted to keep the plaintiff on track in the presentation of his case and discouraged him from asking the same question multiple times. 3)The appeal judge rejected both lines of argument. The appeal judge's findings of fact had been reasonable and the trial judge managed the trial fairly, patiently and efficiently. 4)Leave was granted to appeal pursuant to s.45 of The Small Claims Act, 1997.

The Court noted in its decision in Hazlehurst Estate that although there is dissension between the executors and the court, there is no reason to conclude they will not continue to properly do their duties."
d_1990canlii4118.txt,"In a contract of employment, which involved an agreement changing the plaintiff from 'expatriate' to 'local' status, a termination clause providing that the agreement could be terminated upon 3 months' notice was held to be inadequate language to abrogate the implied term of reasonable notice. The plaintiff had correctly interpreted the clause as relating to the termination of the agreement, not of his employment. The agreement provided that it was governed by the laws of the province of Alberta. The plaintiff had been employed by the defendant for 12 years and was awarded compensation in an amount equivalent to 18 months notice less the three months pay he already received and any income from his new employment over the balance of the 15 months. He was also awarded the loss resulting from the difference in vacation and loss of an auto allowance for the 15 months. For emotional trauma, which lasted only briefly, he received $500.","This was an action for wrongful dismissal. The plaintiff, an American citizen, commenced working for the defendant company as an expatriate. He was given two days written notice of termination without cause. When the defendant went to Argentina to establish an office for the plaintiff, he became depressed. He claimed that he could leave the company on three months notice. The company offered him monies that had been set out in a memorandum referred to by the plaintiff. He refused, claiming that the company had no right to give him such a notice. Dismissing the action without cause, that (1) the defendant did not have cause to dismiss the plaintiff; (2) the clause in the agreement did not refer to termination of his employment; and (3) the plaintiff was entitled to 30 days notice."
d_1993canlii6612.txt,"On appeal from 106 SaskR 277. 47 year old respondent, former President and Chief Executive Officer of STC, had been awarded $165,000 (18 months) for wrongful dismissal. He had successively served three Crown Corporations over a period of ten years. On appeal held the award of damages was not inordinately high. The court however reduced the damages by $16,500 as it disagreed with the trial judge's determination regarding mitigation of damages. Appeal allowed to the extent of reducing the damages from $165,000 to $148,500.","This was an appeal from an assessment of damages in a wrongful dismissal action brought against Saskatchewan Transportation Company. The defendant, STC, admitted to dismissing the plaintiff without cause or notice in breach of its contract of service with him. In consequence the plaintiff obtained a judgment for damages against the corporation in the amount of $165,000, an amount the plaintiff contends is exorbitant. For the most part we can find no tenable basis for concluding that the award of damages was inordinately high. The trial judge assessed the damages on the general principles, that the object of these awards is to compensate for the loss of income sustained in consequence of the wrongful dismissal; that he met his duty to mitigate but had not succeeded in reducing his loss; and that the Crown Employment Contracts Act had set aside the contractual provisions for payment on dismissal contained in all Crown contracts including those of Crown corporations and directed instead that payment be determined in accordance with common law. Was this error? Even if it were, and it was, it was not in substance at least, too much can be made of it. The severance terms of the plaintiff's contract were arrived at with an eye to his earlier service, which included the provision of accounting and related financial services. These terms were obviously founded on the whole of his previous Crown corporation service and would have entitled him in effect two years notice of termination had it not been for the Crown employment Contracts Act."

d_1995canlii4259.txt,"This was an appeal from a Supreme Court decision on an interpleader application by the respondent Shubenacadie Band to determine which of several parties was entitled to be paid a sum of money owed by the Band to the respondent Francis, an Indian residing on the Eskasoni Reserve in Cape Breton, for the construction of residential homes on the Shubenacadie Reserve. Francis had made a number of assignments of book debts, some general and some specific, to the various claimants. The trial judge concluded that he was bound by s.89(1) of the Indian Act, which holds that the real and personal property of an Indian or a band situated on a reserve is not subject to charge, pledge, mortgage, attachment, levy, seizure, distress or execution in favour of or at the instance of any person other than an Indian or a band. He concluded that the money owed Francis by the Shubenacadie band was the property of an Indian on a reserve, and that assignment of book debts, both general and specific, were included within the meaning of s.89(1). He found that the respondent Eskasoni Band was the only Indian entity among the several claimants and ordered the money paid to them. The appellants appealed. Allowing the appeal on the issue of the Indian Act, that s.89(1) does not prevent an Indian from assigning book debts of his construction business to secure business loans. When Indians are in business they hold and deal with their business property in the commercial mainstream on terms no different than those applicable to all Canadians. Nevertheless, the Eskasoni Band is still entitled to the money owed to Francis by reason of having obtained the first general assignment of book debts from him and having registered it prior to Francis making further assignments. The registration of a general assignment of book debts is constructive notice of the assignment to subsequent assignees falling within the provisions of s.3 of the Assignment of Book Debts Act.","This was an appeal from a decision of the trial judge interpreting s. 89(1) of the Indian Act to determine which of several parties was entitled to be paid a sum of money owing by the respondent Band under a construction contract entered into with the respondent. The respondent had made a number of assignments of book debts, some general and some specified to the various claimants. The agreed upon terms of the contract for the construction of residential homes were as follows: 1)The respondent Band did not intend to have the sum of $101,636.33 owing to them held at the Council Office in trust as property of an Indian on a reserve. 2)The Act does not either expressly or impliedly confer any greater right upon an assignee of chose in action that he had before. When an Indian is in business he or she holds and deals with property in the commercial mainstream on terms no different than those applicable to all other Canadians. By registration the plaintiff has preserved whatever rights it acquired by virtue of the assignment and no more In other words its rights are to be determined exactly as if the Act had never been passed. 3)Because of the conflicting case law on the effect of registration statutes in general the Assignment of Book Debts Act was not inconsistent with the provisions of the Bills of Sale."

The deceased and applicant who had been living together purchased residential property in 1997. Their lawyer prepared a written agreement for the sellers and purchasers as well as the mortgage describing the purchasers as joint tenants. The sellers, unrepresented by legal counsel, prepared the transfer of the property and title issued without the words 'joint tenants'. The error describing the purchasers went unnoticed by their lawyer. The respondent had been married to the deceased when he died intestate in 1998. As the title stood an undivided one-half interest was owned by the estate and would devolve to the respondent pursuant to the Intestate Succession Act. HELD: The Land Titles Office Registrar was to amend the existing certificate of title by inserting 'joint tenants' after the names of the registered owners. 1)The requirements set out in Bank of Nova Scotia v. Rochon were satisfied. There was an obvious mistake which required rectification. The deceased and the applicant intended to purchase the property as joint tenants and instructed their lawyer accordingly. The lawyer acknowledged that it was a mistake that the title issued as it did. 2)Although the applicant had an alternate remedy of seeking damages for any loss from her conveyance lawyer, damages were not a reasonably convenient remedy in this case as title would remain registered in the names of strangers, neither of whom could be compelled to sell to the other.","FIAT.

d_2002skqb80.txt,"The Credit Union loaned $37,700 upon security, inter alia, of a 1999 Chevrolet Blazer owned by McMillan. A security agreement was registered at the Personal Property Security Registry in September 2000 and re-registered in November 2001. After McMillan died in June 2001, payments fell into arrears and a demand was made for possession of the Blazer. His widow, the respondent, was shown as co-buyer on the purchase agreement but was never the registered owner until she acquired it from her husband's estate. She sought to defeat the security interest on the grounds she was the real owner at all times, made the payments and was always in possession. At issue was whether the registered owner of a vehicle has the power to grant a security interest enforceable in priority to the interest of a person whose claim, though substantial, is not registered or otherwise of record in any place where the lender has or should have notice of it. HELD: The claim of the Credit Union was enforceable. Judicial notice was taken of the fact there is no title registry in Saskatchewan other than that maintained by Saskatchewan Government Insurance. The licensing function was assigned to SGI under the Vehicle Administration Act. That Act and the Highway Traffic Act are clear the person named in a registration certificate is regarded as the owner of the vehicle. Motor vehicles are unique in that their registration creates a presumption of ownership and follows a declaration of ownership by the registry. Reliance upon the registration system is an important facet of our commerce and would create chaos if reliance is taken away. Ownership does not depend upon registration. However, once a vehicle is registered following a declaration of ownership, a presumption arises in favour of the holder of the registration certificate and as a matter of commercial efficacy lenders, the police, insurers, repairmen, etc. are justified in relying upon the certificate as proof of ownership. A transfer of ownership would defeat the Credit Union's claim only if it were undertaken for value and with notice. No costs were awarded on either motion.","The applicant Credit Union loaned the respondent $37,700 upon a security of a 1999 Chevrolet Blazer. The respondent's wife had apparently been the person who used the vehicle under the registration agreement but she was never the registered owner of the vehicle until she acquired it from her husband's estate. Prior to the expiry of the registration the Credit Union made the respondent aware of their claim and of their intent to realize upon their security. The vehicle was not sold or charged in favour of a third party during the period of September 11, 2001 to November 14, 2001 when the security interest was unperfected. The wife sought to defeat the bank's security interest upon the ground that she was at all times the real owner and was always in possession of the car.

At the conclusion of the trial, the defence brought a motion to exclude the certificate of analysis as the demand flowed from an invalid approved screening device demand. HELD: The defence application to exclude the certificate of analysis based on a breach of s. 8 and s. 9 of the Charter was granted. There being no evidence upon which to convict in regard to the .08 charge, it was dismissed.  1) The Court found a distinction between 'had consumed alcohol' and 'has alcohol in the person's body'. The Court found the words 'had consumed alcohol' to be insufficient for the Court to conclude that the officer had a reasonable suspicion there was alcohol in the accused's body at the time of the demand. 2) There was no objective basis upon which a reasonable suspicion of alcohol in the body could be made. The evidence of alcohol on the breath was not reliable in the circumstances of this case. The admission of having had her last drink was possibly made after the demand and could not be relied on to formulate the required reasonable suspicion. The evidence of bloodshot eyes, empty beer bottles in a plastic bag with three persons in the car and the smell of alcohol coming from the vehicle could not alone support a reasonable conclusion of reasonable suspicion of alcohol in the body of the motorist.","At the conclusion of the Crown's case, the defence brought a motion to exclude the Certificate of Analysis, such evidence flowing from an invalid approved screening device demand, which infringed the accused's s.8 and s.9 Charter rights. At issue was whether the arresting officer formed the requisite belief necessary to make roadside demand pursuant to s.254(2). More specifically, whether the officer's determination that the accused motorist had 'consumed alcohol' was sufficient to bring it within the parameters of this section. HELD: 1)The words 'had consumed alcohol' were insufficient insufficient for the court to conclude that the officer had a reasonable suspicion of alcohol in his body at the time of the ASD demand. 2)Evidence of consumption manifested by physical observation and/or through dialogue with the motorist may well provide such a reasonably reasonable suspicion. The threshold is far lower than the required belief to make a formal breath demand. The wording of s.24(2) is clear and unambiguous. It does not leave a trier of fact with the necessity of drawing inferences that consumption of alcohol at some point in itself equates to having alcohol in the body. 3)There being no evidence upon which to convict in regard to the second count, same is dismissed against the accused."

He required extensive rehabilitation and would not regain his pre-accident physical and intellectual capacity. The mother successfully applied for a reinstatement of child support which had been discontinued by consent, pre-accident, when the son was residing with the father. The son, now 23 years old, was upgrading his high school marks at the time of the hearing and hoped to be admitted to a community college program. The father appealed. Appeal dismissed; the judge's decision to award support was not premised upon a finding that, pre-accident, the son had made a clear decision to pursue a further course of study but on the fact that the son intended to pursue his education and had not withdrawn from parental charge at the time of the accident. There was no evidence to support the allegation that the usual Guideline amount was 'inappropriate' in this case; the Act prohibited the consideration of public income assistance when fixing child support; given the uncertainty about the son's future, this was not an appropriate case for a time-limited order.","The appellant father was ordered to pay maintenance for his son pursuant to the Maintenance and Custody Act. The issue on appeal was whether the father had withdrawn and was unable to withdraw from his parent's charge at the time of the accident. HELD: The appeal was dismissed with costs payable by the father to the mother in the amount of $2,000 together with disbursements as taxed or agreed. The court was not persuaded that the judge erred in concluding that the child had not withdrawn and that it was his intention, to further his education at a post-secondary educational institution."

There was no evidence before the court as to the truth of these allegations and the appellant had stated in his evidence that everyone thought that he treated the children badly. The appellant appealed. Appeal allowed; conviction set aside; new trial ordered. The trial judge misapprehended the evidence because she attributed to it a relevance that it could not have in law or in logic. The appellants evidence about the involvement of Childrens Services did not permit the judge to draw any inference that the children had, in fact, been badly treated or that the appellant was responsible for such treatment. The misapprehension, examined in the context of the judges reasons as a whole and the entire record was substantial, material and played an essential part in the judges reasoning leading to the conviction; the misapprehension had given rise to a miscarriage of justice.","The appellant appeals his conviction by Crawford, J.P.C. on a charge of sexual assault. The appellant testified at trial denying the charge, but the trial judge disbelieved his evidence. On appeal, the appellant argued that his conviction is a miscarriage of justice because the judge based her rejection of his testimony on material misapprehensions of the evidence. He also submits that the judge found him to be a liar because he claimed to have been good to the children when he was responsible for physically abusing and starving them. HELD: The conviction is set aside and a new trial ordered. 1) The trial judge misapprehended evidence was substantial. She ascribed to the evidence about the involvement of Children's Services, relevance that it simply could not have. The inference which the judge drew from this evidence could not be more unjustified. 2) The court found a pattern of reasoning which was not available to the judge in law or in logic on this record and therefore failed to give proper effect to it."
d_2005nssc322.txt,"The plaintiff, who was injured in a rear-end motor vehicle accident, applied for summary judgment and an interim payment of damages. Application for summary judgment granted; application for interim payment dismissed. There was no 'air of reality' to the defendant's defence; whether or not the plaintiff's brake lights were working, to strike her vehicle from behind on these facts meant that the defendant was either travelling too close or didn't have enough care and control of his vehicle. The plaintiff was making a significant claim for damages but she suffered from numerous previous injuries and conditions relating to her health; any damage assessment would depend largely upon credibility and the medical evidence at trial; to assess interim damages in this case would be a most difficult task and would only be a haphazard guess. The plaintiff's claim was also complicated by the fact that it could possibly be subject to the 'minor injury' cap on damages.","The plaintiff was operating her motor vehicle at the time of the accident when she was struck from behind. The defendant argued that there was an arguable issue to be tried in that even if one accepted the plaintiff's evidence that there were no brake lights on the defendant's vehicle, it would still be a haphazard guess to assess whether or not the plaintiffs injuries sustained in the motor vehicle accident resulted in her suffering injuries. Defence also argued that the plaintiff should not be successful in her application for summary judgment because she has not been able to establish that her injuries were not caused by the accident. HELD: The application was dismissed. 1)It is not the function of the court in determining the matter of an interim payment to make findings of credibility or even to dwell on them. If the plaintiff stopped suddenly and the traffic light turned red, her vehicle was supposed to stop as well. To strike the plaintiff from behind on these facts meant that the defendant was travelling too close or didn't have enough care or control of his vehicle and consequently the collision occurred. 2)There was no 'air of reality' to the defence. The plaintiff's prior conditions all contribute in significant way to her current health problems. 3)The evidence submitted by way of affidavits and other evidence caused the court difficulty in assessing the amount of assessed damages. It was necessary for the defendant in his pleadings or via affidavit or other evidence to assert facts capable, if proven at trial, of rebutting the presumption that the collision resulted from his negligence. 4)The bald statement in the pleadings did not disclose the existence of an actual or probable defence and could not fend off the application."

Although the Information to Obtain was based on information from an anonymous, unproven source, the source's information was corroborated by independent information as to the accused's employment and residence. The only corroboration of the presence of a crime (a suspected marijuana grow operation) was from a FLIR test. The court found that the evidence did not rise above the level of suspicion, albeit strong suspicion. Corroboration of the employment and residence of the accused did not provide particular support for the informant's credibility; neither were results of the FLIR test and the presence of covered windows sufficient corroboration. The Crown appealed. Appeal allowed; new trial ordered. Although the trial judge articulated the proper test and began by analyzing whether the warrant could have been issued, the issue was later mistakenly transformed into whether he, himself, would have issued it. By weighing the probative evidence, the trial judge effectively substituted his views for those of the issuing justice and wrongly required the issuing justice to draw proper inferences as opposed to reasonable inferences.","The Crown appealed the conviction of the respondent, who challenged the validity of a search warrant issued by her judge regarding her grow operation. The judge quashed the warrant, finding that the warrant was valid and that the evidence obtained as result of the search was wrongly excluded. The Crown appealed. Allowing the appeal and ordering a new trial, that the trial judge erred in law by misapplying the standard of review established in R. v. Garofoli for the review of an information to obtain search warrant and in failing to place appropriate weight upon the evidence gathered by the confidential informant when evaluating the sufficiency of the warrant. The court found that even had the warrant been quashed, the findings of the FLIR testing and the observations about the covered windows would not have been strong enough to overcome the weaknesses in the source's information. HELD: The appeal was allowed and the trial ordered. 1)On the evidence, there was no breach of s. of the Charter or of the merits of the appeal. The trial judge was entitled to draw his own inferences as long as they were reasonable. He was not restricted to only those inferences deemed proper. This approach restricted the level of deference to which the respondent was entitled. 2)The judge was to consider not whether he would have issued the warrant but instead whether the warrant could have been issued based on the relevant information. The reviewing judge substituted her discretion for that of the issuing judge. This was an error of law. 3)A new trial would be ordered to determine whether the judge applied the proper standard for reviewing the decision to issue the warrant and whether reasonable and probable grounds, established upon oath, could be obtained to obtain a warrant based upon the information obtained in the search."

However, he believes that the Sylvan Learning Center is too expensive. The father did not present any evidence with regard to other possible educational programs for the summer. It is clear that he has not researched alternatives to the Sylvan program. On the evidence, the expense is necessary for Kody. The real issue is whether the father has the means to contribute given his child support payments. If the father pays $472 per month for the Sylvan program, in addition to his s. 3 child support payments, the father's total child support payable would be $1,315 per month. The father would have a net monthly cash flow in the sum of $1,066 while the mother with four children would have available cash flow in the sum of $2,700 per month. Although the father will be stretched, the Sylvan program is necessary and reasonable.  2) Although the mother has an entitlement to spousal support, the father does not have the ability to pay. 3) The father shall pay costs in the sum of $400.","FIAT: The Court ordered a number of orders regarding child support as well as an order regarding summer access. The remaining issues were: what, if any, should the father pay to the mother for extraordinary expenses relating to tutoring for one or both children? The mother proposed that Kody be registered in the Sylvan Learning Centre during the summer of 2007 due to his educational difficulties. Although it was clear from the evidence that the mother had an entitlement to interim spousal support, the father did not have the ability to pay. HELD: 1)The child support application was made pursuant to s.7(1)(d) of the Federal Child Support Guidelines. Although the father will be stretched, the mother's evidence discloses that both children are in need of a specialized educational program given their current problems at school. 2)The childcare costs were necessary and reasonable. The parents were required to bring this motion to obtain an appropriate sharing of s. expenses. The father was ordered to pay costs in the sum of $400. 3)In the matter before me, the Court ordered s.15.3(1)of the Divorce Act to give priority to child support in determining child support applications. The Court found that the father was unable to pay because there was significant conflict on the evidence regarding the payment of loans by the father during this period of time and the issue of whether or not the mother refused to accept payments being offered by him.

d_2009nssm48.txt,"The tenant's year-to-year lease ran from September 1 to August 31. Four months before it was set to automatically renew, he notified the landlord he wished to convert to a month-to-month tenancy. The landlord refused, saying vacancies were hard to fill at any time other than September 1st. The three bedroom rental was in an area with a large university student population and was targeted at individuals sharing not families. It was a high-end rental, and would not necessarily appeal to students. The landlord provided evidence that the last time it was on the market in winter, it was vacant for several months. After a Residential Tenancies Board hearing, an officer declared the tenant successful. The written decision did not mention the landlord's reasons for refusing consent, nor did it say they were arbitrary or unreasonable. The landlord appealed, but offered to compromise by allowing the tenant to terminate the lease any time between May 31 and August 31 without penalty. The officer erred in law. The Act allows the landlord some discretion to refuse a request to convert to month-to-month, providing the refusal is made reasonably. The landlord's reasons were neither unreasonable nor arbitrary, given the reality of the market and his past experiences with a winter vacancy. There may be other situations where consent could reasonably be withheld. The tenancy is declared to have been renewed for another year (with the understanding the landlord will allow the tenant to terminate at any point after May 31). Both parties acted in good faith and, while it might seem unfair to lock the tenant into a lease he believed had converted to month-to-month, the court must make the order the officer should have made in the first place.","This was an appeal by the landlord from an order of the Director which effectively permitted the tenant to convert what had been a year to year lease into a month to month tenancy, but also denied the landlord's request that the tenancy be deemed to have terminated because the tenant effectively refused to renew for another year. This was an interesting and perhaps important issue under residential tenancy law, and what it means when a landlord has been directed not to withhold consent in an arbitrary or unreasonable manner. In this case, the landlord had the advantage of the Landlord's undertaking to accept an early termination on any date from May 31, 2010 (his undertaking refers to 2009), or perhaps August 31 2010. The tenant requested that an earlier date be set given that he had no way of knowing when the lease would terminate and he would be exposed to the very financial risk that he sought to avoid. The Landlord refused to consent, giving his reasons why he believed it was not in his interest to have a month-to-month tenancy. The Residential Tenancies Officer appears to have given no consideration to the landlord's reasons for withholding consent and in particular made no finding that the reasons were either arbitrary or unreasonably unreasonable. However, it was already too late to avoid hardship. An arbitrary decision would be one that is random or based on purely personal whim. An unreasonable one would have no credible rationale behind it. In the unique circumstances of this case the tenant and not the landlord incur that risk."

The question was whether the Crown's evidence was sufficiently credible to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the only physical contact he had on the complainant was for the purpose of defending himself from the alleged aggression of the complainant and whether the Crown was able to prove non-consent beyond a reasonable doubt. HELD: The Court did not know whom to believe and the accused was acquitted.,"The accused was charged with common assault and common assault. The issue is whether the evidence of the Crown is sufficiently credible to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the only physical contact he had on the complainant was for the purpose of defending himself from the alleged aggression of the complainant. HELD: The accused was found not guilty of the offence of common assault contrary to s. 266 of the Criminal Code. The Court does not know who to believe, and he does not constitute a person who is left in reasonable doubt by the evidence. However, it is apparent that there was a great deal of animosity and bad blood which made it difficult for the witnesses to recall and relate in a reliable way what may have happened on the spur of the moment between the parties. As well, there were no other witnesses in the bedroom at the time."

Both appeals are dismissed as a result of the appellant's failure to perfect, including her failure to file necessary materials or comply with the court's directions to do so. While a dismissal of the criminal appeal is a serious remedy, since it means it will never be heard on its merits, the appellant has made it clear that she cannot provide certified transcripts unless the court orders the respondents to pay. The court has already declined to do so. There is no suggestion a further extension of time will result in the appellant perfecting the appeal.","The appellant appealed the June 29, 2011 decision of the Criminal Appeal Court which held that she had committed the act of public mischief when she reported an offence of assault with weapon to an RCMP officer, causing him to enter an investigation, when the alleged offence had not been committed and she was not criminally responsible with respect to this charge. The appellant applied to have the respondents pay for the preparation and certification of the 1,700 pages of transcript she wanted to put before the court on her appeal. The respondents' motions to dismiss her Criminal Appeal and to have them pay to certify the transcripts were granted. HELD: The appeal was dismissed for failure to perfect.  1) Rule 90.40(2) provides the court with an authority to order the respondents to pay the cost of certifying the transcripts and the motion to dismiss both appeals was granted. 2) There is no evidence that the personal circumstances are difficult for the appellant to comply with the filing she is required to do in order to get her appeal to the point where it can be dealt with by this Court.  3) The Court dismissed the appellant's motions to consolidate her two appeals and have the respondent pay for certifications of the transcripts. It is not the Court's function to review specific decision of a specific judge or tribunal for error. 4) The appellant has not satisfied that these appeals raise the same ground of appeal, involve the same occurrences or are in the interests of the parties. It would be unsafe to rely on uncertified transcripts. The suggestion at the end of the hearing that perhaps she could ask legal aid to pay is not realistic. 5) The respondents are granted access to the appeal books."

MLG was unable to explain how cross-examination would assist the Court. As well, the application to cross-examine did not appear to rest on a real need to clarify any issues relevant to the application for which the affidavits had been filed and focused on the relative merits of legal issues rather than on evidentiary issues."," Merchant Law Group commenced a proposed class action against the defendants in Saskatchewan as Q.B.G. 1206 of 2012. The action that names the Crown Hand Pub Ltd. as the proposed representative plaintiff will be referred to as the 'Consortium Action'. HELD: 1) Leave to cross-examine on affidavits filed in support of an interlocutory application is discretionary matter. The applicant must demonstrate that cross-examination will assist in resolving the issue before the court and that it will not result in an injustice. 2) The affidavit evidence filed by the plaintiff in relation to its application for carriage and stay orders, and the defendants' application for stay, deal with the progress of the credit card class action litigation in this and other jurisdictions. However, the information is uncontroverted and a matter of public record.  3) The applications to have the defendant cross-amine on their affidavits are dismissed. 4) Leave will generally be permitted where there is contradictory evidence or where there are sincere and legitimate need for clarification of information that is solely within the knowledge of the affiant. The fundamental questions are not raised in the affidavits but in the brief of law. It is unacceptable for legal counsel to present argument in the form of an affidavit, but it does not follow that by doing so, the lawyer becomes obliged to open up his or her client files for review by third parties, nor examined for discovery with respect to their proposed legal strategies, nor required to debate the merits of future legal arguments by way of cross- examination."
d_2016skpc75.txt,"HELD: The application was dismissed. The court found that the 51 months between the charges and the scheduled trial was sufficiently long to warrant an inquiry into the reasonableness of the delay. As the accused had specifically and voluntarily waived almost five months of the delay, the court deducted that amount, leaving 46 months to be considered. The various types of delay were considered by the court: 11.5 for inherent delay; 15.5 months to be attributed to the actions of the accused; 10 months to be attributed to the Crown; and 10 months to institutional delay. The court found that the accused had not suffered prejudice and as most of the delay was attributable to adjournments sought on his behalf, the court found that the overall delay in this case was not unreasonable.","The accused, charged with 56 offences, including conspiracy to commit the indictable offence of fraud by printing and/or cashing forged cheques, defrauding or attempting to defraud contrary to s. 380(1)(b) of the Controlled Drugs and Substances Act and possession of a counterfeit mark. He alleged the offences were absolute jurisdiction offences as per s. 553 of the Code. HELD: The accused's application for a stay of proceedings was dismissed.  1)The accused had not established on a balance of probabilities that there had been a breach of his right to be tried within a reasonable time. As a result of the factors set out in the Charter application, the accused's right to a fair trial had been infringed. 2)There was a societal interest that was adverse to the interests of the accused. As the seriousness of the offence increases so does the societal demand that the accused be brought to trial. The accused had no interest in an early trial and society's interest would not parallel that of that of his co-accused."

The Department of Social Services had been involved with the family since the birth of the oldest child. The children had been in the care of the Minister at various times and parent aides provided help to the parents when there was child or children at home. The Minister called 18 witnesses. HELD: All three children were committed permanently to the Minister. 1)The mother appeared to be more anxious about excusing the father, who was an abusive alcoholic, than about protecting the children. The mother was unable to parent any of the children on her own. It was concluded under s.11(b) of the Act that there was no adult person able and willing to provide for the children's needs and physical or emotional harm may come to the children if it had not already. 2)The father had recently pleaded guilty to sexual assault on an eight year old girl which could, depending on the facts be a ground under s.11(a)(iii) of the Act for a finding of need for protection.","The Minister of Social Services sought an order under s.37(2) of the Child and Family Services Act permanently committing to the Minister all three of the children of and representing herself.

HELD: 1)An officer of the Department was recommended permanent committal. 2)The children were in need of protection from domestic disharmony and domestic violence. 3)The foster parents were unable or unwilling to take action to protect the children. The evidence showed that the children had been exposed to the domestic violence that was a part of the daily routine of the foster parents. 4)The mother was incapable of supervising or protecting the children and had been in denial of this or to excuse it. The children were to remain in the care of the Minister for six years to the point that they could be returned to or returned to either L or L. 5)The Department had no authority to attach any conditions to the order."
e_1999nsca134.txt,"The appellant was granted release pending appeal, on conditions. The Crown applied for a review. The Crown contended that the Chambers judge misinterpreted the definition of custody in granting the application, as the appellant was on day parole at the time of the application. Dismissing the application, that day parole with a requirement to return to a halfway house each night is a form of custody which allows for an application and release under s. 679 of the Code.","The Crown applied for release pending appeal pursuant to s. 679 of the Criminal Code when the appellant at the time of the application was on release from the federal penitentiary on day parole granted by the National Parole Board under Part ll of the Corrections and Conditional Release Act. The Chambers judge granted the release with conditions, pending the appellant's appeal scheduled to be heard January 26, 2000. The appellant applied for a review under s. 680(1) of the Code on the same date as the amended order. After reviewing the decision of Justice Cromwell and without any new precedents being provided by the Crown following an opportunity to do so, the court issued a written decision. The decision was appealed. The appeal was rescheduled several times due to delay in obtaining the transcript for the appeal book. A panel of the Court of Appeal was ordered to consider whether the Chambers judge erred in law in ruling the appellant, at the relevant time when the application for judicial interim release (R. v. Wood) was in custody within the meaning of s. 670 of the code. Counsel for the Crown relied upon his submission that the appellant was not in custody, therefore the court misinterpreted the definition of custody by granting the 679 application. They raised a number of issues that should be considered on a review of the decision. One of the issues raised by the panel was whether the court had jurisdiction to hear appellant's application for a judicial alternative release (PEDA) when he was on parole under part ll of a parole parole granted under the PEDA or a parole board under a parole or correction and a release under a right to re-entry act in 1999 was refused on the basis that this was a first impression. Counsel were given additional time and they claimed they could not find any other cases on this issue. Allowing the appeal and ordering a review, that first impression is not the best form of first impression and the application should not be taken to mean that the decision has been misinterpreted. On the other hand, if a review was ordered, it could lead to the following conclusions: 1) an application is made to the chief justice or acting chief justice of the court of appeal for direction that the appeal be reviewed by that court; if the direction is refused, no review will be held; 2) a request for a direction in the direction of the Chief Justice in any form that allows the return of all the case law cited in the decision; and 3) a direction to the Supreme Court that concludes that the"

The accused is paraplegic. He moved to British Columbia after his release. He did not appear for trial, and a Canada wide warrant was issued for his arrest. He was arrested and returned to stand trial. The Crown applied to have bail and the surety forfeited. It took the position that the accused had deliberately left the province to avoid trial, and therefore should be responsible for the full $1,000. It also contended that the sureties had a responsibility to ensure the accused's attendance at trial, and that they should also be responsible for the full $1,000. The surety testified that the conditions of the recognizance were not explained to him, and he did not understand the potential consequences of default. Dismissing the applications for forfeiture, that the surety had no concept of his obligations under the recognizance, and was not made aware of those obligations by the authorities. In these circumstances, it would not be just to order forfeiture. With respect to the accused, he is impecunious. His failure to pay any amount ordered against him could lead to imprisonment. As the accused already faces the prospect of imprisonment for failing to attend trial, this would create the potential of double liability for what is in essence the same offence.","The Crown applied pursuant to s. 771 for an order forfeiting the amount of bail set out in a recognizance entered into the the accused in the respect of a twelve year old girl. The accused was charged with four criminal matters, of sexual assault, uttering a threat, sexual touching under s. 151 and unlawfully having a weapon. HELD: The applications for forfeiture were dismissed. The surety was to be responsible for the sum of $1,000. The court found with respect to the following issues: 1) that the accused deliberately left the province to avoid his trial; 2) that he failed to take into account certain important factors; 3) the accused was found to have been in breach of his obligation to appear in Court for trial on a number of criminal charges; and 4) that it would not be just and appropriate to order forfeiture on the part of the surety. The Court held that it was impossible for the accused to drive a motor vehicle at the time of his arrest and thus exceeded his jurisdiction; and 5) that, in addition to his income, the accused might be in danger of losing his motor vehicle if he did not appear for trial. Therefore, forfeiture should not be ordered against the accused."

The registered owner applied for an order declaring her interest in the vehicle was not affected by any forfeiture order. The owner was passenger when 28.3 pounds of marijuana was discovered in the trunk of her Lincoln. She was found not guilty of trafficking and possession of marijuana for the purpose of trafficking. The driver was found guilty of possession for the purpose of trafficking. The trafficking charge against him was judicially stayed. HELD: An order of forfeiture issued pursuant to s.16(1). The application for relief was dismissed. 1)It was not necessary to address the Charter submissions with respect to s.19(3) because Crown counsel consented to the respondent's application being viewed as an application for relief from forfeiture under s.20. 2)It was impossible to conclude the respondent 'appeared innocent of any complicity' in the offence for which the driver was convicted and that she 'exercised all reasonable care to be satisfied' that the Lincoln was not likely to be used in the commission of the offence. 3)Section 11 of the Charter applies only when person has been charged with an offence. There was no charge against the respondent at this time. 4)The Act distinguishes between three types of persons who might own, or have an interest in, conveyance which is 'offence-related property': the interest of person convicted of the offence is forfeitable pursuant to s.16(1); if the person has been neither convicted nor charged and appears innocent of any complicity in the offence; someone charged with the offence which gave rise to the forfeiture application (as here). The forfeiture is not, except with respect to an offender, arbitrary. In view of the provisions available under the Act to obtain relief from forfeiture it cannot be concluded that empowering a court to grant an order of forfeiture constitutes cruel or unusual punishment.","The Crown applied pursuant to s. 16(1) of the Controlled Drug and Substances Act for an order forfeiting the Lincoln to Her Majesty in Right of Canada. Fair was convicted of trafficking in marihuana and possession of marijuana for the purpose of trafficking and Brooks was found not guilty on both counts. At trial, the Crown argued that s. 19(3) contravenes the guarantees contained in s. 11(d) and s. 12 of the Charter. The Crown alleged that Brooks consented to the possession of the drugs in the trunk of the Lincoln because she was a party to a designated substance offence. Brooks denied having any knowledge of the substance offence and argued that the drugs were not likely to be used in the commission of the offence. HELD: The Lincoln was declared to be owned by Brooks. Brooks' application was dismissed. 1)Section 20(4) provides the court with the authority to make an order of relief from forfeiture. 2)It is not necessary to address the Charter submissions. 3)The CDSA does so both through punishment and deterrence. The forfeiture provisions are punitive to the extent that they deprive one of offence-related property, broadcasting the message that Canadian society regards designated substance offences with abhorrence. But they also introduce an element of deterrence in relation to designated substances offences. 4)The affidavit evidence deposed that Brooks was the owner of the vehicle and that it was used to transport controlled drugs and substances. 5)There was no evidence adduced at trial to rebut the testimony of the RCMP officer who testified that the vehicle was stopped by the RCMP. 6)The court was unable to conclude that Brooks had any involvement in the offence of which the Lincoln was convicted."

All seven applicants are parents of children attending the school and none of the applicants have children attending Notting Park. The applicant also raises an issue of standing.

There is no basis in this proceeding to exercise such discretion.  2) In these circumstances there has not been been established the applicants were directly affected. They say the recommendation from the School Review Committee, that 79 students would be transferred from Notting Park to Northbrook, permits it to be said the applicants are aggrieved persons. It seems to me an assessment that they are remote when there is nothing before me but the evidence of only recommendation that the school would induce the introduction of more students into school which is in the family of schools which according to the report setting out the strategy for facilities renewal, have a significant amount of space that is essentially vacant.

It is the position of the School Board that none of these applicants are entitled to standing for the purposes of this application.

The defendant acknowledged the plaintiff fell in its produce department, but did not concede the water on the floor caused her to slip; the cause was, in part, her worn running shoes without laces. Liability and degree of personal injury were in issue. The claim proceeded under the simplified procedure under Part Forty of the Queen's Bench Rules. HELD: The claim was dismissed with costs. 1)The defendant had a duty of care to the plaintiff as owner and occupier. The courts have most often based the duty of care on the invitor/invitee standard. Maxay v. Ramsay Drugs proposed four-part inquiry to determine whether or not an occupier has breached its duty of care. 2)The plaintiff established on a balance of probabilities that she slipped because of water on the floor. The evidence did not support an inference that her footwear caused the slip or was a contributing factor. 3)An adverse inference was not drawn from the defendant's failure to adduce evidence confirming its employee had in fact cleaned the floor. The employee was no longer employed by the defendant. Neither party was able to locate him. 4)Some of her injuries were, in part, the aggravation of pre-existing conditions. The most significant injury was sprain to her left ankle, which had not been resolved primarily because the plaintiff declined to accept available treatment and failed to follow medical advice. The inconsistencies in her affidavit and the physician notes or medical reports respecting her injuries and treatment were not relevant to this decision. 5)A 'sweep log' was kept for each department and employees made regular inspections of the sales floor area in every department. The plaintiff slipped and fell about an hour after the last sweeping. A regular program of maintenance was conducted in the area. The overall policies and practices of regular maintenance and responsibility of each employee were substantially the same if not identical to those considered in the Mollenhauer and Libel group of cases. The defendant met the legal standard of care imposed in the circumstances and was not liable for the plaintiff's injuries. To find otherwise would be to impose a standard that is inconsistent with that previously imposed by this court in almost identical circumstances.","The plaintiff sought damages for personal injuries sustained when she slipped and fell while grocery shopping in the defendant's Superstore. The plaintiff had been in the produce department of the store at around 3:45 pm. She was bandaged, given painkillers and advised to rest and see her family doctor if her injuries did not improve. Some of the injuries she claimed occurred as a result of her slip and fall appeared to have been in part the aggravation of pre-existing conditions. HELD: The plaintiff's claim was dismissed with costs. 1)The defendant met the legal standard of care imposed upon it in the circumstances and was not liable for the injuries suffered by the plaintiff. 2)There have been many cases that have found slippery substance such as water or produce on the floor of grocery store to constitute an unusual danger. The defendant did not know the water was there but did know that water and other substances could be on the Floor of the Produce Department and also knew that reasonable steps must be taken to safeguard against the very type of accident experienced by the general public. 3)There were no errors by the defendant in any of its affidavits filed in evidence. The sweep log indicated that the floor was swept a total of 16 times between 9:00 a.m. and 9:20 pm. Each cleaning was by dry or wet mop. 4)The plaintiff did not cross-examine or raise any of the issues raised by the defendants except for one: that they had not filed separate affidavits. 5)No cross-examination was required in connection with the sweep log as neither the defendant nor its employees had any prior knowledge of the sweep logs. 6)Costs were awarded to the plaintiff for the costs of the appeal."

The wife opposed the application arguing the lay-off was only temporary and that the child continued to be a child of the marriage and that she had no obligation to contribute to the child's extracurricular activities.

There was no change in circumstance as contemplated by s. 14 of the Guidelines. 3)The mother's failure to follow through with her plan and actually commence post-secondary education warranted a change in circumstances. The unreasonableness of the wife's position warranted an assessment of costs. Costs were warranted in this case because the husband had not met his burden. His income had increased since the May 2002 order and the wife had received employment insurance benefits in 1999 and 2000. She required financial support in the interim so that she could save money to go to school and pay off a debt that was the result of an automobile accident.

There had been delay of approximately 14.5 months from the time that he was charged with exceeding the breathalyzer and impaired driving to the date of his trial. Stay of proceedings granted. At his first court appearance the defendant requested the first available trial date and there was no evidence to suggest that an institutional delay of 13 months was the norm in other metro provincial courts. Given the nature of the charges, the technical nature of breathalyzer law and the defendant's stated intention to raise ss. 8 and 9 of the Charter, prejudice could be inferred on the basis that the length of delay was likely to interfere with the quality of evidence tendered.","This was an application for a stay of proceedings based on a violation of the right to be tried within a reasonable time pursuant to s. 11(b) of the Charter. The accused was charged with exceeding the Breathalyzer and impaired driving. He was arraigned on the information and requested the first available date for trial. The Defense had verballyized an intention to raise s. 8 and s. 9 Charter motions and lead evidence. HELD: The application was stayed.  1)The length of the delay was well outside the 8-10 month guideline established in R. v. Morin (supra). 2)There was no evidence that the accused waived any of his rights, explicitly or implicitly. Given the nature of the charges and the technical nature of a breathalyzer law, the fact that the Defense has verbalized an intent to raise ss.8 and s9 Charter motions, the delay is likely to interfere with the quality of evidence tendered given the passage of time that has occurred since the charges were filed. 3)Prejudice to the accused could be inferred. The length of delay was likely to impede the plaintiff's ability to defend himself and to have his name cleared and reputation re-established at the earliest possible time.

His vehicle wandered somewhat in the lane, but did not stray into the other lane. The observations of his driving were made over 2-minute period. The aspects of the driving that were observed may have been the result of driver inattention. 2) The bloodshot eyes may have been the result of chain smoking. Further, the evidence of glazed eyes is inconclusive in the absence of reliable evidence of bloodshot eyes. 3) The evidence of flushed face was reliable evidence of impairment. 4) The evidence of strong odour of alcohol is reliable indicia of impairment, due to the consumption of alcohol by the accused. 5) The accused did not have any problem with balance, but was moving in slow and deliberate manner. If the accused was not displaying difficulty with balance and coordination, then the suggestion that he was moving slowly is not a credible indicator of impairment. The accused did not display slurred speech and appeared to comprehend his legal rights and obligations. He did not display any mental confusion or inappropriate behaviour. In the absence of expert evidence to explain the scientific basis for the physical tests administered, the proper method of application and their reliability the Court could not rely on them. 6) The accused blew 80 milligrams on two occasions. However, regardless of the alcohol consumption and the accused blood alcohol concentration, the only reliable indicia of impairment were a strong odour of alcohol and a flushed face.","The accused was charged that on April 27, 2002, he did operate a motor vehicle while his ability to do so was impaired by alcohol or a drug, contrary to s. 253(a) of the Criminal Code. The issue was whether the evidence was sufficient to prove impairment beyond a reasonable doubt. HELD: The accused was acquitted of all charges.  1)The Court found that the accused was not displaying any symptoms of impairment. The only signs of impairment were his blood alcohol consumption, a very strong odour of alcohol and a flushed face. 2)On the Crown evidence, the accused did not display slurred speech. He appeared to fully comprehend his rights and obligations in his communications with the peace officer and legal aid duty counsel. However, his response in stopping was somewhat delayed and he braked abruptly. The opportunity to make the observations was only during roughly 2 minutes. 3)The accused suggested that his bloodshot or watery eyes may have been the result of his previous consumption of alcohol or drugs. 4)Although there was no expert evidence to explain the scientific basis for the tests and the proper method of application and to comment on their reliability, it was not appropriate for the Court to rely upon them on the issue of guilt or innocence to the prejudice of the accused. The accused's explanation for the alleged erratic driving was that it was windy, windy and he was visiting with his companions. It was not unusual for him to speed to some extent on the highway as he passed the vehicle that he had just passed. He indicated that he was in the process of passing another vehicle but that he did not stray into the other lane. 5)Although the accused's blood alcohol content did not show any impairment, the presence of a strong smell of alcohol was a reliable indicium of impairment and would not be given undue weight by the Court.  6)In assessing credibility, the Court held that in the absence of expert evidence such as that offered by R. v. McKenzie (P.N.) (1999), [2001] and (2003)(S.J. No. 218) in the Ontario Court of Appeal judgment, the evidence of impairment alleged by the Crown must be considered in the context of the principles of Stellato (1994), 31 C.R. (4th) 60, in which the Supreme Court of Canada approved the following: 2)The Crown purported to rely on the results of standardized field sobriety tests, including horizontal gaze nystagmus, heel and toe and the"

HELD: 1) On the charge that the accused endangered the life of the complainant by attempting to strike her with a motor vehicle, the Court had strong suspicions that the accused did intend to strike the complainant with the vehicle but could not convict. 2) There was no doubt that bodily harm was caused to the complainant. The accused admits he slung her on the ground and kicked her and, as a result, the court find the accused guilty of assault causing bodily harm. 3) There is no doubt that the accused was operating a truck and that he drove it toward the complainant, who was lying on the concrete, and her daughter. It is unnecessary for the Crown to prove that the lives or safety of others were actually endangered. The offence is proved where the Crown establishes that the driving complained of was dangerous to the public. The offence requires a marked departure from prudent conduct. The offence of dangerous driving was established and the accused was found guilty. 4) The accused was found guilty of two counts of assault.","The accused was charged with two counts of assault causing bodily harm contrary to s. 267(b) of the Criminal Code and one count of attempting to strike his estranged wife with a motor vehicle thereby committing aggravated assault. HELD: The accused was found guilty on both counts. 1)The evidence established that the accused operated the motor vehicle in a manner dangerous to the public and the Crown had proven each and every ingredient of this offence to my satisfaction beyond a reasonable doubt. The offence requires a marked departure from prudent conduct.  2)The Court found the accused guilty on all of the counts. The Court had strong suspicions the accused did intend to strike the wife with the vehicle. However, the Court was left with a reasonable suspicion about the intention of the accused."
e_2005skpc8.txt,"The accused is charged with committing a sexual assault contrary to s. 271 of the Criminal Code. The accused was police officer with the Regina Police Service for 25 years until he retired in 1999 with the rank of Deputy Chief of Police. In the fall of 2001, he was appointed Justice of the Peace. The Crown proceeded summarily. The first incident involved the accused bringing the complainant's hand to his crotch. The second incident involved the accused touching the complainant's breast and crotch and trying to kiss her. The issues are whether the Crown proved the actus reus and mens rea of the offence. HELD: The accused is guilty of sexually assaulting the complainant in both courtroom 10 and the Youth Court general office. 1) The alleged touching occurred and it was of a sexual nature. The complainant did not consent to the contact. 2) The parties, along with most of the employees in the building, were often subject to or the source of numerous crude jokes and comments of a sexual nature. The accused believed that his discussions with the complainant about such matters were serious. However, at no time did the accused express his desire to get to know her or to see her outside of the workplace. He did not raise the possibility of physical relationship nor did she express any interest in sexual liaison. When he suggested it, she was not enthusiastic. The interactions described by the accused are more consistent with normal interaction between persons in that particular workplace than with an indication of consent to sexual activity. Looking at all the evidence, there is nothing to support an honest belief on the part of the accused that the complainant consented to the sexual contact. The accused's suggestion that he had an honest but mistaken belief in consent cannot be considered because the Court could not cobble together from the totality of the evidence sufficient evidence from which it could be said that the accused could have drawn an honestly held belief or from which he could have honestly inferred that the complainant had consented to his touching her.","The accused was charged that, on or about August 21, 2003, he did commit a sexual assault on the complainant contrary to s. 271 of the Criminal Code. The Crown elected to proceed summarily. The accused was employed as clerk at the Provincial Court Building. She assumed her duties in 1998 and although she testified that she knew of the accused in 1999, it was much more likely that she met him in the spring of 2002 after he assumed his duties as Justice of the Peace in the same building. HELD: The Court found that the accused’s perception of his relationship with the complainant was that of someone who had been sexually assaulted by the accused and that, based on the evidence provided by the complainant, he had not been detained and that his right to counsel under s. 10(b) of the Charter had been infringed.  1) It was necessary that certain findings of credibility be made in this case.  2) There was some consistency as to the incidents that occurred prior to August 21 and the same cannot be said about the events of August 21."
e_2006skqb231.txt,"The plaintiff applies for certification pursuant to The Class Actions Act on behalf of himself and the other passengers of an international flight from the Dominican Republic to Regina. The flight was delayed for about 1.5 hours at the Dominican Republic airport as result of several mechanical difficulties. The claim is with respect to alleged negligence, unlawful confinement and breach of contract. HELD: The applicant has failed to establish the first criteria as set out in s. 6(a) of the Act. The application for certification is dismissed on that basis. 1) The court accepts that all of the defendants are governed by the provisions of the Montreal Convention of 1999. The wording of Article 29 of that agreement is clear. Any claims for damages of passenger of an international flight can only be brought within the ambit of the Montreal Convention of 1999. The court reviewed the cases and found that the plaintiff's claims outside the ambit of the Montreal Convention of 1999 in negligence, breach of contract, unlawful confinement and punitive damages do not disclose a cause of action. 2) The sole exclusive remedy available to passengers is set out in Article 17(1) of the Montreal Convention of 1999. strict liability regime has been set up with cap of damages where passenger sustains 'bodily injury' as result of an injury that occurs in the course of embarking or disembarking. It is settled law that for a passenger to have access to Article 17(1), the individual must have suffered a bodily injury as opposed to mere mental anguish. It has not been established that any bodily injury has been sustained by any of the passengers on Flight 361. It is plain and obvious that the claim does not raise a reasonable cause of action. Corrigendum received dated July 20, 2006 and added to fulltext.","The plaintiff applies for certification of this action pursuant to the Class Actions Act on behalf of himself and the other passengers of an international flight being held in Canada. The flight was delayed for about an hour and half at the Punta Cana airport as a result of several evolving mechanical difficulties referred to by the pilot as 'creeping delay'. The defendants opposed the certification application on the basis that none of the five criteria as set out in s. 6(a) of the Act had been met by the applicant. HELD: The application is dismissed. 1)The test to be applied in certification applications is similar to those used in applications to strike statement of claim as disclosing no cause of action. All allegations of fact pleaded are to be accepted as true and secondly, pleadings will only be struck if it is plain and obvious that the plaintiffs cannot succeed. The court should be reluctant to deny plaintiff his or her day in court. 2)Although no specific case law was provided to the Court with regard to the Montreal Convention of 1999, there is ample case law with regard its predecessor, the Warsaw Convention, as to its exclusive remedy for passengers. Those cases include Connaught Laboratories Ltd. v. British Airways, 2002 CanLII 4642 (ON SC), 217 D.L.R. (4th) 717 (Ont. S.C.J.), and Wirth v. Airline Pilots Association (1) which involved a claim against a commercial airline and package tour operator arising from a crash landing. Although the plaintiff was given until March 2006 to file case law on the narrow issue of the meaning of 'bodily injury' within Article 17 of the Montreal convention, it was given the opportunity to file any material in reply. 3)The generous approach to be adopted on this application is specifically spelled out at s. 4(2)(b of the CAA which provides that the court may adjourn the application for certification to permit the parties to amend their materials or pleadings or to permit further evidence to be introduced. 4)Although the onus is on the plaintiffs, on certification application, to satisfy the Court that the pleadings disclose causes of action, it is not very high onus."
e_2006skqb508.txt,"The Crown appeals the decision of the Provincial Court judge that found the respondent's rights under s. 10(b) of the Charter has been violated and in excluding the certificate of analysis, acquitted the respondent. The Crown argues that the trial judge misapplied the reasoning of the Supreme Court in R. v. Prosper in his analysis of the circumstances surrounding the police officer's demand for the respondent to provide his breath sample. The issue on this appeal is whether Prosper requires the police in the Saskatchewan jurisdiction, where faced with a detainee that has changed his mind and declined legal advice, to inform that detainee that he has a right to a reasonable opportunity to contact a lawyer and that the police have an obligation not to require the detainee to participate in any incriminating process until the detainee has had a reasonable opportunity to contact a lawyer. HELD: 1) Prosper addresses the issue of the police's obligation in jurisdictions where free, preliminary legal advice is unavailable. Oppositely, Saskatchewan has Brydges duty counsel available to detainees and no such obligation exists. Having reviewed the law as stated in Prosper, the Court concluded that the trial judge erred in finding that this case was analogous to the facts in Prosper, and in finding that the police officer had an obligation to provide a 'Prosper warning' to the respondent once the respondent had changed his mind and declined legal advice. 2) The police in Saskatchewan are required to provide any detainee with information so that detainee may access that legal advice. Once the police are confronted with detainee who changes his mind and declines legal advice, this waiver must be clear and unequivocal. 3) The evidence falls far short of proving that the respondent was frustrated, impatient probably, but not frustrated. The exchange lasted about minutes. The evidence shows a detainee who chose to neither wait for the telephone line to be available nor to telephone a private lawyer.","The Crown appeals the decision of the learned Provincial Court judge that found the respondent's rights under s. 10(b) of the Charter of Rights had been violated and, in excluding the certificate of analyses, acquitted the respondent. The only evidence led in the voir dire at the trial was that of the police officer who had stopped the respondent in a routine traffic stop of vehicles entering Saskatoon from the east. After the officer determined that he had reasonable and probable grounds to believe the respondent was operating his motor vehicle while impaired, he arrested the respondent, read the respondent his right to retain counsel and gave the requisite police warning. In reviewing the evidence before the learned trial judge, the judge could not have reasonably reached the conclusion he did. The evidence showed a detainee who chose to neither wait for the telephone line to be available nor to telephone a private lawyer in order to inform the respondent that he has a right to have counsel. HELD: The appeal is dismissed. 1) The lack of Prosper warning does not mean that the respondent’s waiver was not valid. The police did not take the opportunity to give the additional information to the accused. The Court reviewed the evidence to determine whether the Crown had met the burden of establishing the respondent gave an unequivocal waiver when he changed his mind about seeking legal counsel. 2) The evidence falls far short of proving that respondent was frustrated. Impatient, probably, but not frustrated. The exchange lasted about 5 minutes. The Crown witnesses testified that they telephoned the respondent three times and each time the line gave a 'busy' signal. The receipt of the breathalyzer certificate in this case was a direct result of the breach and because of that it must be kept out, as it would be unfair to proceed with the trial without it going in, given the circumstance."
e_2006skqb534.txt,"The primary issue in this application is the respondent's claim to retroactive support. HELD: 1) The Court reviewed the cases from the Supreme Court of Canada regarding retroactive child support and in particular D.B.S. v. S.R.G. et al, 2006 SCC 37. 2) The respondent has been content to accept $380 per month as fair level of child support for both children. What precipitated the respondent's review in July 2006 was Meghan's departure from his home where she began to live independently with the prospect of attending college. What further propelled the continued action on the respondent's part was the publicity attendant with the Supreme Court of Canada's release of its judgment in July 2006. There is no reasonable excuse as to why the respondent did not seek a variation earlier, other than concluding that the respondent accepted $380 per month as reasonable in the circumstances that prevailed from July 2003 to July 2006. 3) There is no evidence of blameworthy conduct on the petitioner's part. There was no agreement or obligation to disclose tax returns. No written request was made pursuant to s. 25 of the Guidelines. No verbal request was made by the respondent which might fall within the definition of 'effective notice'. The increase in the petitioner's level of income over the years 2002 to 2005 is not so dramatic as to constitute blameworthy conduct that privileges the petitioner's own interests over her children's right to an appropriate amount of support. In 2002, the petitioner earned $32,800 and, by 2005, she earned $43,310. An increase of these proportions would not lead the Court to conclude that the petitioner was not contributing to her children's support in a satisfactory manner. The Court's view of the evidence is that the annual increases equivalent to roughly 10% per annum, when adjusted for the annual rate of inflation, are not so significant that the petitioner would have reasonably thought that she was feathering her own nest at the expense of her children. 4) There was no evidence that the children's standard of living was compromised as a direct consequence of the petitioner not taking the initiative to adjust her child support payments annually. Nor was there evidence of financial hardship experienced by the children. 5) To order retroactive support of $4,322, whether payable in a lump sum or by installments over time, would represent a hardship to a wage earner in the petitioner's category. The application for retroactive child support is dismissed.","HISTORICAL REVIEW: The respondent applies to vary child support orders and/or the alleged agreement struck by the petitioner and the respondent in or about July 2003. The respondent seeks to vary pursuant to s. 17(1) of the Divorce Act and s. 10 of The Family Maintenance Act. In addition to a variation of the amount of child support, the respondent asks that the variation order apply retroactively to July 1, 2003.  1) There is no evidence that an agreement was struck. The petitioner and respondent agreed in 1999 that the respondent would continue to have joint custody of the children. However, in 1997 the respondent made an informal adjustment to monthly child support to become $380.00 per month. This became the prevailing course of conduct without the formality of either court order or formal agreement. 2) The petitioner did not engage in blameworthy conduct. The annual increases equivalent to roughly 10% per annum are not so significant that the petitioner would have reasonably thought that she was feathering her own nest at the expense of her children. 3) The respondent's delay between June 2004 and July 2006 (the first time the respondent broached the issue of revising child support by sending a letter to the petitioner) is a reasonable excuse for inaction. To order retroactive support of $4,322.00, whether payable in a lump sum or by installments over time, would represent a hardship to a wage earner in the petitioner's category."

e_2009nssc204.txt,"An unrepresented university student appealed his conviction for uttering threats after he sent an email to his computer science professor requesting his assistance to de-bug a program contained in an attachment. The attachment was text file with lot of extra characters, including messages that read 'good job, but am going to kill you' and 'I am so horny.' Although the professor had not taken the content of the attachment as threat, he had sent it on to university officials as he had been requested to alert them to any odd or unusual behaviour by the student. The student later advised the professor that he had typed the messages because he thought someone was monitoring what he was typing and he was trying to get reaction out of them. He also testified that he had not intended to send that particular attachment to the professor. Appeal allowed; conviction quashed. The trial judge erred in permitting inadmissible evidence to be adduced from the university administration to the effect that the accused had a psychiatric illness and, in failing to intervene when the Crown assumed that the student had put his character in issue and cross-examined him as to alleged prior acts of misconduct and other extraneous matters, the cumulative effect of which was fatal to the trial judge's findings of credibility. The case against the student was entirely circumstantial and it was equally open to infer that the words had been typed in the file to get a reaction from people that the student, rationally or otherwise, believed to be monitoring his keystrokes and did not constitute a threat to cause death to the professor.","The appellant was a student at St. Francis Xavier University when he sent an email to his computer science professor with an attachment. Although the professor did not take the content of the attachment as a threat, he sent it to university officials as he had been requested to alert them to any odd or unusual behaviour by the appellant. The police were contacted and a charge was laid against the appellant of uttering a threat to the professor to cause his death, contrary to s.264.1(1)(a) of the Criminal Code.

e_2009skca40.txt,"This is an appeal from a judgment in which the trial judge held that the sale of farm land by the then 79 year old appellant was valid and that her solicitor in the transaction was not negligent. The appellant widow agreed to sell four quarters of farmland, including residence and some grain bins on the land, to the respondents by lease option agreement. The total price was $120,000. The terms were favourable to the purchasers, the monies being paid over years with most deferred until the final year. There was no interest. However, the appellant was permitted to reside in the house for her lifetime if she paid the utilities and the property taxes. The trial judge noted that the appellant resided on the land for years and there was no complaint made until the appellant's daughter, from whom the contract had been concealed by joint agreement between the appellant and the purchasers, found out what had happened. The sole issue on appeal was the applicable standard of review in H.L. v. Canada (Attorney General) [2005] 1 S.C.R. 401. HELD: Appeal dismissed. 1) There is no doubt that the central facts as found by the trial judge regarding the contract, the competence of the appellant and the relationship with and the conduct of the purchasers was supported by probative evidence. It is impossible for an appeal court to interfere with those findings, even if the Court had wished to. 2) With regard to the allegation of negligence against appellant's lawyer, contrary to what the appellant suggest, an independent meeting is not absolutely necessary for the solicitor to ensure comprehension of the contract. It is of course desirable, but the critical matter is for the solicitor to satisfy himself that the client comprehends the transaction. The trial judge found that the appellant understood all aspects of the contract. The matter of the timing of the private meeting between the appellant and her lawyer is not relevant, given that the appellant after the meeting continued to be prepared to enter into and perform the contract. If she had manifested some unease after she signed the agreement and then met with her lawyer but before the delivery of the contract to the purchasers, other issues and no doubt other evidence would have been considered in determining when the contract became effective in the circumstances. The claims against the appellant's solicitor are without a factual basis.","This was an appeal from a judgment in which the trial judge held that the sale of farm land by the then 79-year-old appellant was valid and that her solicitor in the transaction was not negligent. The appellant sought to set aside the transaction under various heads of contract law including duress, undue influence, unconscionability, equitable fraud and mistake. The facts briefly are that the appellant, a widow, agreed to sell four quarters of farmland, including a residence and some grain bins, to the respondents, the Clements, by lease option agreement. The total price was $120,000 allocated $100,000 for the land and $20,000. The terms were indeed favourable to the purchasers, the monies being paid over 7 years with most deferred until the final year. There was no interest. However, the appellant was permitted to reside in the house for her lifetime if she paid the utilities and property taxes until December 31, 2006. The issues raised were factual and the standard of review in H.L. v. Canada (Attorney General) had been met. The trial judge concluded that the plaintiff, when she entered the contract, had full capacity. She saw no reason on the evidence to doubt her competence and that is fully supported by her testimony at the trial when she was in her late 80's."
e_2010skca79.txt,"The RCMP conducted search of farmland near Canora. They were also shown pictures of the accused who was likely driving white Tempo. The search revealed marijuana grow-op. The accused was later seen by officers driving. The officers chased the Tempo for 41 kms, but the vehicle was driven into the ditch, and the driver escaped on foot. Four years later the accused was arrested in British Columbia and brought to trial. The accused was convicted of three drug offences and two driving offences following a jury trial. He was sentenced to a total of 35 months in prison. The accused appeal both the convictions and the sentence. HELD: The accused argued the convictions were unreasonable and not supported by the evidence. The grounds were: (a) the officer's eye witness identification evidence cannot support a conviction; (b) the trial judge made inappropriate comments about whether the accused could have outrun the officer at the end of the car chase, if he was the driver; (c) an adverse inference should been drawn from the Crown's failure to call the second officer; (d) the trial judge's treatment of the photographs of the accused misled the jury about what had to be proven to establish the accused was driving the Tempo; (e) the jury was improperly lead to place reliance on an assessment of a witness's credibility made by an officer who questioned him about his possible involvement in the grow-op. The Court found: (a) the jury was alerted to the frailties of the officer's identification evidence, and the convictions were not unreasonable in light of the evidence as a whole; (b) it was open to the jury to consider whether the accused could have outrun the officer, and the judge's caution about changes in physical condition over time put the issue into a proper perspective; (c) the judge told the jury that it could draw an adverse inference from the Crown's failure to call the second officer, but the decision lies with the jury and the judge is not obliged to tell the jury that it must draw the inference; (d) when the charge is considered as a whole, the jury was not left with the impression that if it concluded the pictures were of the accused that it somehow followed that he was the driver of the Tempo; (e) the judge's remarks did not improperly influence the jury's assessment of the witness's credibility. The imposed sentences fall within the standard range for similar offences and were not demonstrably unfit.","Following a jury trial, the appellant was convicted of three drug offences and two Criminal Code driving offences. He was sentenced to 35 months in prison. The appellant appealed his convictions and his sentence, arguing that the former were unreasonable and the latter was too severe. HELD: The appeal was dismissed with written reasons.  1) The issues identified by the appellant do not operate to make his convictions unreasonable. The trial judge warned the jury about the dangers of eye witness identification evidence. She underscored that an honest and apparently convincing witness can be mistaken on identification issues. 2) When the charge is considered as a whole, the jury was not in any way left with the impression that, if it was the appellant who was driving the white Tempo, it somehow followed the driver of the other vehicle. The evidence raised by the trial judge clearly indicated to the jury it could not place a special, or indeed any, weight on the appellant's assessment of his veracity. In her decision to impose consecutive sentences of 35 months for the production and possession offences, and 25 month consecutive sentences for the driving offences, she was not persuaded that either of these circumstances warranted an unreasonable amount of time on appeal."

The accused was sentenced to 2 years and 3 months for the s. 342(3) offence, 1 year and 6 months consecutive for the offence under s. 380(1) and 2 years concurrent for the personation offence under s. 403(a). The Court gave the accused double credit for remand time that was the result of system delays, but imposed 1:1 credit for the 393 days of remand time that were attributable to the accused. The Court held that the high dollar value involved, the pre-meditation and planning involved, the lengthy period of time over which the accused committed the offences, the number of transactions involved and the fact that the accused committed these offences from prison were aggravating factors. In mitigation, the accused offered a guilty plea. The primary factors to be emphasized were denunciation and deterrence.","The accused was presented with an indictment containing five counts. At the arraignment, the Crown stayed counts and granted a global sentence of eight years and six months. The accused plead guilty to three counts. The sentences were varied to correspond to the gravity of the offence, the time actually served on remand, and to varying degrees of incarceration. HELD: The global sentence was reduced to four years and nine months from 10 years and a credit of 4 years and 9 months given for time spent in custody. 1)The offences were very high because of a number of aggravating circumstances. The offences were pursued over a lengthy period of time and involved scores of transactions. 2)The accused pleaded guilty. While it was long time in coming, it has avoided lengthy trial and the attendant expense. What is even more important is that the accused had no income and would not have any for some time. 3)The conduct of the accused was most unusual in that it occurred while he was in prison. It involved many persons, living or dead, with an intent to gain advantage for himself or another person, contrary to s.403(a) of the Criminal Code. 4)The Court imposed a combined sentence of 8 years and 6 months, which was eight years 6 months consecutive to the preceding sentences. The credit was granted for time served of 1,336 days for that period. 5)The credit was one for one for double time or put otherwise. The time actually spent on remands was put into the global sentence because of time constraints which necessarily are a part of the process.  6)There were numerous individuals and businesses subjected to embarrassment and anxiety. 7)The principles of sentencing remain with the court despite s.719(3) and (4)of the Code because the offences were committed and the charges brought before enactment of the section. The discretion to grant credit remains with the Court despite the s.730(3)(4) and s.786(4) because the two counts were brought about because of the time constraints that a credit and global sentence must be set out. It was also held with respect to the fact that the offences fell within the definition of offences and did not concern the administration of justice."
e_2011skqb244.txt,"The appellant was convicted of impaired care and control and acquitted of a charge of care and control with a blood alcohol level exceeding .08 because of Charter violations. The appellant was senior member of the Saskatoon Police Force who was charged by members of his police force. The trial judge based his conviction on the evidence of two officers who testified that they observed signs of impairment including bloodshot, red eyes, flushed face, slurred speech, strong smell of alcohol on his breath and dry lips and mouth. In convicting the accused, the trial judge rejected the evidence of third officer who testified that the only sign of impairment he noted on scene was that the appellant had alcohol on his breath. The issues on appeal were whether the trial judge erred in his treatment of the evidence of the third officer, whether the trial judge erred in considering the observations of the other two officers as evidence to be admitted on the impaired driving count and whether the conviction for impaired driving was an unsafe verdict. HELD: The appeal was dismissed. The trial judge did not ignore or reject the evidence of the third officer. He provided extensive reasons why he preferred the evidence of the other two officers to the evidence of the third officer. The trial judge is in special position to assess the credibility of witnesses by being able to observe the witnesses as they testify and compare their observations to the testimony of the other witnesses. The findings of fact in regard to the testimony of the three police officers are supported by the transcript of their evidence and do not amount to conjecture of speculation. The trial judge made express findings of credibility with respect to the two officers and preferred their evidence to that of the third officer. There is no inherent improbability that would justify interference with the trial judge's findings on credibility. The appellant argued that the officer's evidence that the appellant had slurred speech should have been excluded because the trial judge excluded the actual statements made by the accused as violation of the accused's Charter rights under s. 10(b). Slurred speech is known physical indicator of impairment absent evidence of another cause. While statements made by an accused may not be introduced to prove impairment unless the accused has been advised of his Charter rights, physical manifestation such as slurred speech may be introduced to prove evidence of impairment. The appellant's argument that the verdict is unsafe or unreasonable was also rejected. The trial judge concluded that the Crown had proven beyond a reasonable doubt that there was evidence of impairment sufficient to meet the standard in R. v. Stellato. There was no palpable or overriding error in the verdict.","The appellant appealed his conviction for impaired care and control of a motor vehicle while his blood alcohol content exceeded the legal limit of.08 contrary to s. 253(1)(a) of the Criminal Code. The appellant argued that the trial judge erred in considering evidence that was not admissible on the impaired count, namely that the central Crown witness provided exculpatory evidence, which the learned trial judge did not accept. HELD: The appeal was allowed and the conviction was upheld. 1)The trial judge made express findings of credibility concerning the evidence of the two police officers who were notified of the appellant's symptoms of impairment prior to being informed of his right to counsel. The observations were not part of conscripted evidence which would place the administration of justice into disrepute in a Charter analysis. 2)Although the appellant was acquitted of the impaired driving count, his s. 10(b) right to self-examination was denied on appeal. The trial judge reviewed the transcripts of the three police officers' testimony and found that although the appellant had been drinking and had been in good standing with the officers at the scene, his evidence concerning slurred speech did not support the conclusion that he was impaired. The learned judge did however accept the testimony of one of the breath technicians, who testified that he had noticed signs of impairment on the appellant when he was off duty. The breath technician testified that his first contact with the accused was when he noticed that the accused had dilated pupils, his mouth was dry, he was constantly licking his lips and he was as well smacking his lips. The second officer testified that the only symptom of impairment that he noted was that he could smell alcohol on his breath. That evidence as a statement of fact is clearly insufficient to prove he was in fact drunk as it was conclusary in nature. It is up to the Court to decide what the level of impairment of an accused person is and to whom it must be concluded that the individual's functional ability to drive motor vehicle is impaired.  3)The learned judge made no errors in his considerations concerning the credibility of the witnesses. He did not resort to conjecture or speculation as suggested by the appellant."
e_2011skqb444.txt,"In the evening, the accused inmate and his two co-accused inmates placed themselves in close proximity to the complainant inmate at table at the Penitentiary. The co-accused threw hot liquid from the cup directly into the complainant's face and the three inmates commenced stabbing the complainant with weapon. second complainant inmate attempted to intervene to assist the first complainant and the accused and co-accused began to stab the second complainant. The first complainant suffered severe first and second degree burns to his face and to his shoulders as well as numerous puncture wounds and lacerations but was not critically injured. The accused was charged with aggravated assault on the first complainant and common assault on the second complainant. None of the inmates testified at trial other than the accused. The accused testified that he felt he was being shunned in the Block and had received threats from the first complainant and others in the complainant's group who were brandishing shanks earlier that day. The defence argued that the Crown failed to prove that the injuries caused to the first complainant fell within the definition of 'wound, maim, disfigure or endanger life'; and that the acts done to the first and second complainants were in self-defence as contemplated by s. 34 of the Criminal Code. HELD: The accused was convicted of both counts. 1) In relation to the accused's defence of self-defence pursuant to s. 34(2) pertaining to the first complainant, the Court found the accused did not believe that he was being assaulted within the meaning of the law and, even if he did hold this belief, such a belief was not reasonable in the circumstances. Further, the Court did not accept, on a subjective or objective basis, that the accused reasonably believed that the first complainant had the present ability to carry out the threat, notwithstanding that the physical aspect of the assault need not be imminent or immediate. Lastly, the Court found that the accused did not believe that he had no other option. The accused admitted that he had other options but chose not to avail himself of them. 2) The Court found it did not need to assess the application of s. 37 of the Code in relation to the common assault charge. Rather, the Court found s. 27 of the Code applicable and determined that the second complainant was legally justified to use as much force as was reasonably necessary to prevent the commission of an offence which would be arrestable without warrant. The Court found the second complainant was clothed in legal justification and the accused was not entitled to the protection of s. 34(1) because the accused provoked the assault, and the force he used was more than necessary to defend himself as the accused was armed with a shank and the second complainant was not.","HELD: The accused was charged with aggravated assault and common assault. The Court found that the accused’s actions were done in self-defence as contemplated by s. 34(2) of the Criminal Code. Given that the incident was captured on two security videos, it was not legally necessary to establish that the Crown had failed to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the injuries caused to the victim fell within the definition of wound, maim, disfigure or endanger life. The accused had inflicted injuries to nine inmates in the course of the assault on Dorion. The Crown asserted that the wounds were caused in part by the accused pulling a hot liquid from a cup directly into the face of the victim. At issue was how the acts should be construed. HELD: 1)The accused was found guilty of both charges. The offences were both aggravating and serious. The mens rea requirement for aggravated assault is an objective foresight of bodily harm. The defendant admitted to the actions in the video and admitted to them that his group moved in unison with the purpose of attacking the victim and that he believed that something was about to happen and that it was going to be 'bad' and that Dorion was the recipient of some type of violence. 2)There was no issue as to identity. In R. v. McConnell, [1996] S.C.R. 321 (Alta. C.A.], the Supreme Court of Canada held that an assault may be made by a person doing, or in the manner of, an actual assault is not a prerequisite for defence under s.34(2). A person who is unlawfully assaulted and who causes death or grievous bodily harm in repelling the assault is a party to the plot to which he was party. In this case, the accused demonstrated that his intent was to inflict bodily harm on the victim so that he would not be 'killed or disfigured' by the actions of the other joint participants. 3)Although the accused did not throw the hot liquid in the face, he participated and assisted in the joint assault that led to the injuries. There was no doubt as to who was involved."
e_2012skpc161.txt,"The accused plead guilty to one count of aggravated assault, a breach of undertaking for failure to keep the peace and be of good behaviour and failing to comply with a condition of a youth sentence by failing to report to his youth worker. The victim came out of his house because he was concerned that someone was trying to damage his vehicle. The victim had baseball bat when he confronted the accused and group of young people. One of the accused's friends was pushed and fell backwards hitting his head. The accused said the victim hit him on the back with the bat. The accused got the bat and hit the victim five times in the head. The accused and another youth also kicked the victim while he was down. After the assault, the accused and his friends fled, leaving the victim in the alley. The victim suffered serious injuries including shattered jaw, every bone in his face was broken, his skull was fractured and he suffered brain bleed and lost teeth. He is also going to lose his eye, has memory loss and had to sell his business because he cannot work. The Crown applied to have the offence declared a serious violent offence and sought a sentence of 24 months, being 16 months secure custody followed by 8 months community supervision. At the time of the offence the accused was 17 years and months of age. He identified as Metis youth, but had no connection to cultural activities and claimed he had not been subjected to racism or poverty. His parents were separated. He was not attending school or working at the time of the offence. He had an extensive criminal record including 17 entries for compliance related convictions, previous property related convictions, for obstructing police offences and one for uttering threats. He had served five open custody sentences. HELD: The offence was declared a serious violent offence. The victim will be significantly and permanently disabled as a result of the offence and there can be no doubt that the accused caused intentional and grievous bodily harm to the victim. The court held that the egregious nature of the assault, serious harm done to the victim and the fact that the youth was subject to release conditions with respect to a weapons offence at the time he committed the assault were aggravating factors. In mitigation, the accused had entered a guilty plea, was cooperative with the police investigation, had done well in pre-sentence detention and had expressed remorse for his actions by submitting an apology letter to the court. The accused was sentenced to 24 months secure custody followed by 18 months probation. He was given 2:1 credit for the time he was on remand, leaving 18 months custody of closed custody to serve of which 12 months would be actual custody and 6 months would be community supervision. The court held that a lengthy custodial sentence was necessary to provide meaningful consequences and to achieve meaningful progress for the accused. A period of secure custody and supervision would give the accused access to psychological counselling and programming, an opportunity to work on his education and a chance to engage with support services in the community prior to release from custody. Given the accused's violent response in this case, it was clear that intensive programming is required.","The accused pleaded guilty to aggravated assault thereby endangering the life of the victim contrary to s. 268(1) of the Criminal Code and failing to comply with a condition of a youth sentence that he report to his youth worker, contrary to ss. 137 and s. 137 of the Youth Criminal Justice Act. The Crown applied under section 42(9) for a determination that the aggravated assault be designated as a serious violent offence. The accused was sentenced to a secure custodial sentence of 24 months to be followed by a period of probation with credit for pre-sentence detention, 6 months of community supervision and 6 months community supervision. On the offences of breach of undertaking and breach of probation, the court imposed a sentence of 18 months, 12 months of which will be served in closed custody followed by 6 months Community supervision. The young person will be permanently disabled by the time he is sentenced. In these circumstances, the young person did not oppose the Crown's application."

e_2013skca1.txt,"The proposed appellants are some of the defendants in an action commenced by Schneider against them on the grounds that he, as representative plaintiff, and others suffered financial losses due to negligence on the part of McMillan. The representative plaintiff and other investors purchased 'cells' in gold exploration prospect owned and promoted by Royal Crown Gold Reserve Inc. based on that defendant's representation that the purchase price was deductible from the purchaser's earned income for income tax purposes and the tax opinions provided by McMillan. McMillan's opinion letters were posted on Royal Crown's website. The representative plaintiff purchased the cells and then filed tax returns claiming deduction, which was disallowed by the Canada Revenue Agency. The representative plaintiff commenced this action claiming that he and others suffered financial losses due to McMillan's negligence. McMillan applied to strike the statement of claim on the grounds that it was devoid of merit pursuant to Queen's Bench Rule 173(c) and opposed the certification of the action on the basis that the relationship between them and the representative plaintiff was insufficient to found a recognized duty of care between a lawyer and a non-client. Their application was supported by affidavits indicating that their tax opinions were not to be given to prospective investors. The plaintiff filed an affidavit from another lawyer, who deposed that when he prepared such opinion letters regarding tax consequences he reviewed all the underlying documents and agreements beforehand to protect the reputation of his law firm, knowing that the opinions were often relied upon as marketing tool to potential investors. The Chambers judge dismissed McMillan's application and it brought this application for leave to appeal under s. 8 of The Court of Appeal Act except as provided by s. 39(3) of The Class Actions Act. HELD: The Court dismissed the applications. It held that the Chambers judge was correct in holding that the action was not devoid of merit or vexatious. The judge had reviewed the affidavits and concluded that a lawyer may owe a duty of care to a non-client in specific circumstances, including those of this case. McMillan should have been aware of the use made by the mining industry of opinion letters and taken steps to prevent their opinion being used inappropriately for the purpose of inducing potential investors to invest with their client. The Court also found that the Chambers judge did not err in certifying the claim of negligence as a common issue that predominated over other issues affecting individual members of a class. McMillan's argument that the factual base pled by the representative plaintiff did not establish a common issue to meet the requirements of s. 6(1)(c) of The Class Actions Act failed because, in this case, the class members suffered real losses allegedly as a result of McMillan's negligence. These facts coupled with the case law stating that a lawyer may owe a duty of care to a non-client and the plaintiff's affiant's evidence, established a common issue that met the requirements of the Act.","HELD: The application was dismissed. The chambers judge dismissed the application and certified the action as a class action against all defendants. The proposed appellants applied pursuant to s. 8 of The Court of Appeal Act, 2000 for an order granting them leave to appeal from the chambers judge's certification order and his dismissal of their Rule 173(c) application. They argued that the Chambers judge erred in law in failing to apply the Anns test, by conflating foreseeability with proximity in the first leg of the Ann's test, and by failing to consider and apply the policy considerations which may preclude or negate the finding of duty of care under the second leg. They also raised the issue of whether the relationship between the respondent and the representative plaintiff did not establish a common issue within the commonality requirements of s. 6(1)(c) of the Class Actions Act. They relied on the decision in Re: Collections Inc. v. Toronto Dominion Bank (CanLII), which held that the common issues would not advance the claims of the class because they were all predicated on theory that had no foundation in fact. The losses the plaintiffs alleged in that case were based on a flawed premise. The facts, coupled with case law stating a lawyer may owe a fee of care to a non-client and the evidence of the law firm's lawyer, Gary Friedman, did not constitute sufficient merit to warrant the Court's attention. The Chambers judge also made no errors in law with respect to the affidavits filed."
e_2013skqb264.txt,"The parties had three children during their marriage. After the marriage ended in 1988, the husband respondent, medical specialist, moved from Moose Jaw to Ontario where his annual income was about $175,000. The children stayed with the petitioner wife in Moose Jaw. She was not able to work as registered nurse until she upgraded her education, which she slowly did as she could afford it. She and the children lived on very little income and relied upon social assistance because the respondent often did not pay child support. The parties were regularly in court. In 1994, the respondent left his position in Ontario and moved to Milwaukee, believing his prospects were better in the U.S. However, he lost his position in Milwaukee and opened his own clinic. His income dropped to as little as $15,000 in 2001. In this application, the respondent applied to vary two support orders, one made in 1998 and the other issued in 2001. He sought to expunge the arrears in respect of each and a declaration that the three children are no longer children of the marriage. His reason for seeking to have the arrears expunged was because he, now 72, wanted to retire in the next couple of years. The petitioner, 63, deeply in debt and on long-term disability, was still caring for one of their children because he suffers from schizophrenia. HELD: The Court held that two of the children had ceased to be children of the marriage as of 2002 and 2008 respectively. With respect to the third child, the Court found that as a result of the serious and long-term mental health problems suffered by him, he remained a child of the marriage. The Court then found that the respondent's arrears in respect of the 1998 child support order were $7,000. Based upon the respondent's imputed income of $109,000 per year established by the Court in its 2001 order, and the dates upon which the two children ceased to be so under the Divorce Act, the Court calculated the amount of child support owed by the respondent at $186,300. The Court rejected the respondent's argument that he could not afford to pay the arrears because his expenses left him with an income surplus of only $13,000. The Court discounted most of the claimed expenses and found that the respondent had $58,000 at his disposal and therefore had the ability to pay his arrears. The Court found that the respondent had chosen to minimize his earning capacity by staying in the U.S. in private practice and thus the respondent could not assert that the Court should use his actual income rather than his imputed income to vary the amount of child support he was ordered to pay in 2001. The undue hardship that the petitioner had suffered for 25 years constituted the most compelling reason for the Court to refuse to reduce or expunge the respondent's arrears. The application was dismissed and the respondent ordered to pay arrears and to pay child support in the amount of $927.","FIAT: The respondent seeks to expunge child support arrears that have accumulated as a result of his not paying child support for many years. He is 72 years old and practising internal medicine and is looking to retire in the next few years. The petitioner is on long term disability and the parties have been married for some 12 years. HELD: 1) The respondent has not paid child support in the past 3 years. Almost every dollar that was applied to child support was taken from the petitioner by garnishment process or the interception of federal government monies directed to him. He did not pay child support willingly it had to be snatched away from him. It is repugnant to even suggest that child support should be reduced because of undue hardship. 2) There is no dispute as to the calculations. Income was imputed to the respondent in the amount of $177,000 and he was ordered to pay $2,335 in 2002, $3,742 in 2003 and $298 in 2004. Arrears under the 2001 order were $176,746. The 2001 order was varied and therefore his child support obligations are still calculated on an income of $109,912. 3) The Court cannot find that the respondent does not have the ability to pay the child support owed. The Court reviewed Wurmlinger and D.B.S. (2003 SKQB 152) at para. 1. The nature of the maintenance order sought to be varied, 2. The ongoing financial capacity of the payor, 3. Any unexplained delay in enforcement of child support payments would cause hardship. 4. The respondent will have a few lean years until he has paid off the arreaars. 5) The petitioner should receive the full amount that, but for his dodging his obligations, would have been available to her when she was raising their children. 6. The arrear is $183,745. Should they be expunged or reduced? 7) It is commonplace for the respondent's obligation to continue even though he did not record it on its statement. 8. The court reviewed the factors set out in D. B.S.'s decision and concluded that it was not appropriate to deprive a parent of their child support obligation. 9) The principles of distributive justice, economic justice, and the pursuit of happiness in a free and democratic society do not apply here. 10) The law as it pertains to imputed income has not changed. In the absence of some special circumstance, ar"
e_2016skpc30.txt,"HELD: The accused was granted a curative discharge. The court found that the accused had met the required onus of this type of application in accordance with R. v. Ahenakew. The accused’s conduct over the past 18 months satisfied the court on the balance of probabilities that hers was an exceptional case and that a curative discharge would not be contrary to the public interest. The court imposed numerous conditions on her, including that she could not have or consume alcohol and should report to a probation officer, receive addiction counselling, participate in AA meetings and provide proof of her attendance to her probation officer. Her driver’s license was cancelled and she was prohibited from driving for two years.","The accused entered guilty plea to one count of driving a motor vehicle while her blood alcohol content was over 80 milligrams of alcohol in 100 millilitres of blood and asked to be granted a curative discharge pursuant to s. 255(5) of the Criminal Code. HELD: The Court found on a balance of probabilities that the accused was in need of treatment to deal with her alcohol consumption and addiction. A curative release would not be contrary to the public interest. 1)Given the two prior convictions for drinking and driving, the accused had been through the Impaired Driver Treatment Centre in 2010 and had completed one week of detoxification in 2014. 2)She had demonstrated good sobriety and quality of life. 3)The Court was satisfied that her case was the exceptional case contemplated in Ashberry and Ahenakew as well as the other cases to which reference were made."
e_2017skqb219.txt,"HELD: The court found the following with respect to each issue: 1) the grandmother was a person of sufficient interest regarding the children pursuant to s. 6 of The Children’s Law Act, 1997 and had standing to bring her application for custody; 2) it would be in the best interests of the children, now aged ten and nine years of age, to have their primary residence with their grandmother as she was their psychological parent. They had resided with their grandmother for most of their lives and it was important to maintain their relationships with their school and friends. The respondent would have regular weekly parenting time with the children; and 3) the evidence was inadequate to consider child support.","The third party in this matter is the maternal grandmother of the two children. The grandmother seeks an order that she and the father have joint custody of the children but her home be the children's primary residence. HELD: 1) There is an interim order designating the grandmother as a person of sufficient interest on an interim basis. This designation was made pursuant to s. 6 of The Children’s Law Act, 1997 and is applicable when a family member pursues custody. Not only does the grandmother have a blood tie to the children, but the children have lived with her for the past seven years. Her access is to be intermittent and she is willing to provide the father with parenting time with the children.  2) In the interim order granted in March 2009, the father was granted access for three weekends in a row with no access on the fourth weekend. The matter proceeded to pre-trial settlement conference. It is clear that there were concerns regarding the father”s use of alcohol and drugs. However, the grandmother testified that her home was the primary residence for the children and was to continue to be so for the foreseeable future. 3) The grandmother was not opposed to the father having reasonable and liberal access with the boys. There was no evidence that her access was sporadic prior to his access. The evidence from the parties’ prior settlement conference did not support the idea that the father should have supervised access. 4) The father represented himself at trial and did adequately conducted his case.  5) The proper focus of an inquiry in relation to the “sufficient interest” question, in the circumstances, is the nature of the relationship between the applicant and the child. The child was the grandmother. The issues are whether the grandmother can show a settled commitment to the child and an intention to be continuing and meaningful presence in the life of the child, and whether the father can serve an application for contempt by obtaining an order for substitutional service.  6) It is generally accepted that non-family applicant is person with sufficient interest. The court should consider a variety of factors including the extent or degree of his involvement in the family, the extent of her involvement, the length of their relationship, the type of parenting arrangement, the issues with regard to medical care, counselling and education, the relationship with the mother and the mother's parenting relationship, and the issues of access and maintenance."
