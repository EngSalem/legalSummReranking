"The wife sought a divorce, as well as maintenance for herself and the five year old daughter of the marriage. The parties had been married 10 years; the husband had worked long hours daily for 28 straight days during which he was confined to the oil rig and then had 28 days off. The wife was an innately intelligent and ambitious person. She was to provide a good home and healthy environment for her daughter. For the petitioner and child, that the Separation Agreement should be incorporated into a Corollary Relief Judgment so that jurisdiction of the court may permit; the tax consequences to a custodial parent not reflected in the direct cost of supporting a child were to be assessed.","The petitioner sought a divorce and maintenance for herself and the couple's five-year old child. The wife was working and earned a modest income; the husband a substantial one. Allowing the application, that although the wife upgraded her education during the marriage with encouragement and financial support from the husband, she was entitled to maintenance for an indefinite period. The court reviewed the means and needs of the parties and awarded spousal in addition to child maintenance. The court recognized the indirect financial consequences to a custodial parent in raising children."
"The applicant sought a declaration under s.63 of the Personal Property Security Act that her interest in a group registered retirement savings plan (later defined as the 'Group Plan') was not subject to a security interest she granted to Crown Life. She further sought an order restraining Crown Life from arbitrarily cancelling her participation in the Group Plan. HELD: 1)The provisions of s.146(2)(c.3) of the Income Tax Act do not apply to the applicant. The taking of security interest by way of a loan agreement contravenes s. 146(2) and s.147(2); and 2)The applicant had not retired and there appeared to be no evidence of her having retired or of any pension benefit payment arising as outlined in the Plan Contract. The applicant's request for a direct transfer did not comply with s.7.03 as the provision set out in the plan contract prohibiting the taking of any security interest under the plan. Since the applicant was not a bank director, Crown Life was not entitled to the order directing a transfer of her interest. 3)The loan agreement contains no provision enabling Crown Life to collapse the applicant's account in the group plan and thereby create an attachable pension refund. If it did, such a provision would violate s 146(12) as well as s.8.03. 4)The application for a restraining order was denied. 5)Since Ms. Corscadden has not retired the applicant cannot establish a pension entitlement or a share in a registered retirement income fund (RRIF) unless a proper request for the transfer has been made by her.  6)Since the applicant has not been a party to the plan Contract and there has been no breach of the terms of that contract, no special order or order respecting the use of the proceeds of the sale of the assets in any event pursuant to s.150(1)(c) or s.155 of the Code of Conduct, the application for restraining order denied.","The Applicant participated in a group retirement savings plan ('GRSP') created by Crown Life for its employees. The GRSP provided for an annuity income on retirement for each participating employee. To finance her contribution to the GRSP, she secured an interest-free loan from Crown Life and pledged her interest in the GRSP as security for the loan. Subsequent to leaving her employment with Crown Life, she refused to repay her loan and requested that her contributions to the GRSP be transferred to another carrier. When Crown Life refused, she applied under s.63 of the PPSA for an order declaring that Crown Life's security interest in the GRSP offended s. 146(2)(c.3) of the Income Tax Act which prohibits the taking of security in an RRSP in certain circumstances. She also sought orders requiring Crown Life to comply with her request to transfer her contributions and restraining Crown Life from realizing on its security. HELD: Application dismissed. 1)The terms of the GRSP and the security agreement in this case did not offend s.146(2)(c.3) of the Income Tax Act. 2)If the terms of the GRSP were breached by Crown Life, damages would be an adequate remedy. The Applicant's request for a restraining order was therefore refused. 3)Under the terms of the GRSP contract, Crown Life was not entitled to collapse the Plan. 4)No amount was due out of the Plan to the Applicant until she retired or made a proper request for a transfer. In this case her request for a transfer did not comply with the terms of the Plan. There was therefore nothing to which the security interest of Crown Life could attach until a proper request for a transfer was made or until the Applicant commenced her pension."
"The City applied to have the Director of Labour's Standards Branch issued a certificate pursuant to s. 60 of the Labour Standards Act declaring that the City owed its transit employee $511.08 in wages. The Director filed a letter reducing the assessment to $318.41 (including annual holiday pay). At the hearing the Director filed another letter, reducing theessment to less favourable pay. The City brings this application to review theessment. By ss. 10(1) and 6(2) of the Act an employer is required to pay an employee at the rate of time and one-half for every hour worked in excess of 32 hours in any week containing a public holiday(holiday) or for hours worked over 32 in a week which has a holiday in it. The provisions of the agreement should govern, and not those of, the Act. HELD: The application was allowed and the certificate was amended to show that there were no wages due orowing to the employee on the day of the public holiday. There was no order as to costs.","The Director of Labour Standards issued a certificate against the City of Regina certifying that it owed a transit employee $318.41 in wages for hours worked in weeks containing a statutory holiday in excess of 32 hours as provided in the Labour Standards Act. The City applied for a review. HELD: The City's application was allowed. Under the terms of the collective agreement in force, the employee was actually paid 4 hours pay in excess of the Act's requirements for each of the weeks in question. Pursuant to section 72 of the Act, therefore, these particular terms of the collective agreement applied since they were, when considered in light of the balance of the agreement, more favorable to the employee than the requirements of the Act."
"The appellant appealed a decision of the Nova Scotia Utility and Review Board concerning an award of compensation pursuant to the Victims' Rights and Services Act. He alleged that the police investigation had indicated that they would not be proceeding with criminal charges. Because the program was unable to confirm through the criminal justice system that you were a victim of a crime, we were unable to make a compensation award. The appellant appealed. Dismissing the appeal, that the Board correctly interpreted its jurisdiction, made findings of fact that were within its jurisdiction and the record reveals there was ample evidence arising from the de novo hearing to support its findings. The decision was protected by the finality provision of the Legislature's legislation.","This was an appeal from the decision of the Nova Scotia Utility and Review Board allowing an appeal from the decision of the Victims' Services Division denying compensation to the respondent on the basis the police had not proceeded with criminal charges for an assault which had occurred. Dismissing the appeal, that the Board had correctly interpreted its jurisdiction and made findings amply supported by the evidence arising from the de novo hearing. Failure of the police to lay a charge against the attacker did not disqualify the applicant from compensation if it was otherwise supported by the evidence."
"FIAT. The parties separated in the summer of 1994. All other issues raised in the divorce proceeding were left in abeyance including the issue of spousal maintenance. The petitioner had unilaterally reduced the monthly support from $3,000 to $1,500 for the months of September through December 1995. Since then the petitioner had reduced the support to $900 per month. HELD: 1)The application was premature. There were too many unknown factors surrounding the future situation of either party to conclude that what the applicant asks for is fair and reasonable. There is the uncertainty of the petitioner's future job and income. Also, there is uncertainty as to what she will require if she does go to a university this fall. Finally, there are uncertain prospects for their future. 2)In an interim application it would be premature to apply the amount of maintenance the guidelines suggest. 3)The court was of the opinion that the court was not entitled to unilaterally reduce the $1500.00 maintenance he consistently paid up to December 1995 to $800.00 without at least consulting with the petitioner. 4)The petitioner was entitled to direct costs of 1/3 of each month in accordance with the guidelines. 5)Spousal support was not to be varied.","FIAT. The parties were divorced in 1995 and all issues including spousal maintenance were left in abeyance. The petitioner had agreed to pay $3,000 per month which included child support but the support was reduced to $1,000 and was irregular and late. The two children were living with the petitioner and although old enough to hold jobs, had been unable to find employment. The petitioner's income exceeded $80,000 annually but he had been suspended with pay and the status of his employment was uncertain. HELD: 1)It was premature to fix the amount of spousal maintenance as asked for by the applicant. There were too many unknowns including the future of the petitioner's future job and income and how much the applicant would require should she go to university in the fall and what the children would do about future education. 2)The petitioner was not entitled to unilaterally reduce the maintenance. 3)The petitioner was directed to pay $1,500 plus $200.00 per month until the shortfall was paid in full.  4)The applicant was awarded costs of the application."
"After a sub-contractor failed to complete its contract work, a supplier of materials to the sub contractor sued the general contractor and the surety under the terms of a Labour and Material Payment Bond for payment of a balance owing to it by the subcontractor. The contract stipulated that the respondent would be entitled to recover any amount owing to the subcontractor. In the absence of a contract, the respondent could not have obtained a contract directly with the principal. The Mechanics' Lien Act does not expressly state that it binds the Crown. Therefore, the contract did not apply. The respondent was relying on the statutory liens to avoid paying under the Bond while, at the same time, resists paying the statutory lien fund on the basis that there is no money owing to All Ports until such time as it completed the subcontract. HELD: 1)The claims of the plaintiff against the respondent and London Guarantee were dismissed. 2)If the Mechanics'Lien Act had been applicable, the plaintiff would not have been entitled to recovered anything due to the third party statutory liENS. 3)If it was not applicable, then the respondent's claim against the subcontractors would be dismissed. 4)The respondent would pay the costs of Rideau Construction and London guaranteeee which, because they are represented by the same counsel, will be single amount as may be agreed upon between counsel or, if agreement is not possible, will set by the Court at the time an Order for Judgment is taken out.","After a sub-contractor failed to complete its contract work, the plaintiff, a supplier of materials to the sub-contractor sued the general contractor and the surety under the terms of a labour and Material Payment Bond for payment of a balance owing to it by the sub-contractor. The Bond contained a provision limiting the liability of the surety and the principal to make payment to any claimant not having a contract directly with the principal. Dismissing the action with costs, that there was no evidence of intention to contract, valuable consideration, or binding promise to pay between the general contractor and the supplier. With respect to the principal, as the Bond limits the liability of the surety and principal to make payment to a claimant such as the plaintiff not having a contract directly with the principal, liability is limited by the Bond to the amount which the principal would have been obliged to pay to the plaintiff if the provisions of the Mechanics' Lien Act applied to the work. As the contract was with the Crown, and the Act is not binding on the Crown, the general contractor was not obliged to pay anything to the plaintiff. Therefore, the supplier was not entitled to recover against the surety under the Bond."
The accused was charged with offences contrary to s. 271(1) and s. 153 of the Criminal Code. The evidence of the complainant was that the accused touched her vagina and breasts numerous times on a regular basis. He often slept on the couch or in the living room adjacent to the room where the family watched TV. There was a couch or love-seat in the house adjacent to where the complainant usually stayed up at least until midnight. Sometimes he would walk into the bedroom and have sex with her. She called the police. The accused was convicted of both charges. HELD: 1)There was insufficient evidence to confirm the accused's innocence. The circumstantial evidence was not strong enough to confirm his evidence. The Crown's evidence was found to be beyond the reasonable doubt. 2)The accused is not guilty of either charge. His behaviour is not dangerous. His explanations are not questioned. His anger and frustration are with the Court and not with the Judge. There is insufficient evidence surrounding the Crown's guilt. The Court cannot conclude that his behaviour is dangerous. It would be perverse to have the Court believe that his evidence is not supported by the evidence surrounding his allegations. There would not be sufficient evidence to convict the Judge of his or his other crimes. The Judge would not have taken judicial notice of this evidence. His explanation of his behaviour and the fact that he is prone to sexual assault is beyond the scope of this article. 3)The Court was unable to take judicial notice because of the repeated assaults by the accused.,The accused was charged with sexual assault and touching contrary to s.271(1) and 153 of the Criminal Code. The alleged offences occurred in the complainant's home when she was between the ages of 13 and 15. HELD: The accused was found not guilty on both counts. 1)There was insufficient confirmatory evidence for proof of guilt beyond a reasonable doubt. The evidence showed an escalating pattern of intrusive behaviour by the accused who admitted to touching her on two occasions and to have been on top of her once. His explanation that he fell on her was farfetched but the other explanations were not outlandish. None of the complainant's allegations involved alcohol nor was drunkenness alleged to be a factor. The evidence of the complainant's depression or withdrawal could have other explanations.
"The accused appealed his conditional discharge and three years probation on the basis that the Tan case required that a second conditional discharge not be made available in relation to the matter arising out of similar circumstances in comparison to a prior discharge. The learned judge misconstrued the situation. Accepting the recommendation of both the Crown and the defence, that there be a conditional discharge, 3 years probation, absolutely no contact direct or indirect with the named victim and no contact with the accused for three years. This was a reasonable way to proceed.","At issue in this sentencing appeal for breach of probation was whether or not a person can receive a second conditional discharge in relation to a matter arising out of similar circumstances in relation to a prior discharge. allowing the appeal, sentencing the offender to three years probation with conditions, that an offender may receive a discharge where he had already received one for another offence."
"FIAT. The defendants sought to amend their statement of defence by pleading, in effect, Accord and Satisfaction. The application was opposed. The trial judge directed the defendants to proceed by notice of motion in chambers and the trial was adjourned. HELD: 1)The application must be dismissed.  do so and fix the costs at $400 to be paid by the applicants within 30 days.  2)The amendments proposed raise new and unexpected issues. The applicants can't provide no explanation for their long delay in bringing these matters forward. 3)The affidavit in support of the application contains several statements consider significant. It is not appropriate to enter into consideration of the evidence on this application. The matter could have been adjourned without any additional cost or inconvenience to the parties. 4)If the amendment were granted, it would mark a significant change in the course of the action. It would result in further discoveries, discoveries and discoveries and presumably a further pre-trial conference to address the completely new questions raised by the amendments.","FIAT. The defendants sought to amend their statement of defence at the opening of trial. They applied to include accord and satisfaction as a defence, alleging that the parties had settled their differences through negotiations and the transfer of property 11 years earlier. Application opposed. Trial adjourned while motion heard in chambers. HELD: Application denied. This action extended over 4 years and was ready for trial. The applicants had no explanation for the delay in bring this matter. There was also no explanation for why the applicants' counsel did not alert the respondent's counsel before the trail or at least at a time when the matter could have been adjourned without additional cost or inconvenience. The applicants are guilty of inexcusable laches. The proposed amendments raised new and unexpected issues. It would be a significant change in the course of the action resulting in further discoveries, examinations, etc. to address the completely new questions raised by the amendments. Applicants to pay costs within 30 days. Applicants' request for leave to argue this motion by phone was refused as it was a substantive motion involving lengthy submissions by counsel."
The applicant applied for leave to appeal a decision of Queen's Bench chambers dismissing his application for relief under s. 61 of The Queen'sBench Act. HELD: The application was dismissed. The applicant still had a right to redeem upon payment. No issue of importance had been raised nor did it see any merit to the applicant's appeal. Leave to appeal was denied. The respondent was awarded its costs on double Column V at the City Hall.,Applicant applies for leave to appeal a Queen's Bench Chambers decision dismissing his application for relief under s.61 of the Queen's Bench Act. HELD: Leave to appeal denied. The respondent has costs at double Column V. The considerations to be applied in a leave to appeal application is 1)whether the issue raised by the proposed appeal is sufficiently important to the litigation before the Court or to the practice in general to warrant consideration by the Court of Appeal. 2)Whether the applicant's proposed submission to the Court of Appeal has sufficient merit to warrant the granting of leave. 3)Whether there is any delay in the proceedings which would be caused by the interjection of an appeal. Here the applicant has misconstrued the mortgage agreement. The applicant still has a right to redeem upon payment. No issue of importance was raised nor did the Court see any merit to the applicant's appeal
"The accused objected to her arrest and to the seizure of a duffel bag containing a quantity of narcotics. The police conducted a voir dire as result of the opening of the trial. A great deal of evidence was presented, the majority of which was elicited in very detailed and extended cross-examination. The accused also called evidence on the voirs dire but did not testify. HELD: The arrest was lawful. The search of the house and seizure of the bag were incidental to the arrest and therefore lawful. Pursuant to s. 9 and 8 of the Charter the police need not demonstrate anything more than reasonable and probable grounds. If there were any violations of the accused's rights under the Charter, the police would be entitled to search an arrested person for a weapon if under the circumstances it seemed reasonable to check whether the person might be armed. To exclude the evidence in question would, in fact, bring the administration of justice into manifest disrepute.","The accused was charged with ten counts including robbery, aggravated assault, assault causing bodily harm, possession of stolen property and trafficking in narcotics. She raised s.9 and 8 of the Charter in objecting to the arrest and seizure of the duffel bag. The voir dire occupied 5 days. HELD: 1)The four requirements set out in R. v. Feeney for a warrantless search were satisfied. The arrest was lawful. The search of the house and seizure of the duffel bag was incidental to the arrest and therefore lawful. 2)The accused had no expectation of privacy with respect to either her friend's residence or the bag. The decision in R. v. Edwards was squarely on point. There was no evidence tying the accused to the gym bag. It was of a different description than the one used in the drugstore robbery. The accused never asserted ownership of the bag or made any claim to any interest or right with respect to it. The gym bag constituted non-conscriptive evidence. 3)If there were any violations of the accused's Charter rights (and it was concluded there were not) they were of a minor nature and not sufficient to engage the provisions of s.24(2) of the Charter. To exclude the evidence would bring the administration of justice into disrepute."
The debtor made a consumer proposal which was accepted by his creditors and PricewaterhouseCoopers was appointed Trustee under the proposal. At some point during the proposal Mr. White defaulted and defaulted. The proposal was deemed to be annulled. PWC was taxed and allowed in the appropriate amount. The Superintendent objected on the basis that this court should review the trustee's fee given that the trustee accepted payments after the deemed annulment. HELD: The court's jurisdiction was limited to the Superintendent to review the fee and to set a specific number if PWC and the Superintendent cannot agree on what should be the amount of fee. The excess monies should be distributed to the creditor's who should be advised their original debts remain receivable.,"The Trustee received funds after a debtor defaulted on a consumer proposal. The Trustee sought to have its fees taxed.,fees taxed based on the funds received by the Trustee prior to default. The default is deemed to be an annulment of the proposal and all funds received post-default must be distributed to the creditors."
"FIAT. On January 24, 2002, this matter was heard in chambers and the issue was to be determined by the trial judge in the course of the action. The plaintiffs' counsel was under extreme pressure and lot of stress lately with respect to this file and others and therefore had prepared three motions which were fairly similar to one another. In his confusion he had filed some and not filed others. HELD: 1)The matter was reserved on the issue of whether costs should be assessed against the plaintiffs. 2)Because of the peculiar circumstances surrounding the three applications, the applications were dismissed. There was a request by the defendants' counsel to have the matter addressed by way of costs. 3)Given Tapp's representation as to the amount of stress that he was presently under, it was not appropriate in the circumstances to assess costs against them over the conduct of their counsel or against counsel directly at this time. Accordingly, the matter was left to the trial court to determine its course.","FIAT. The issue was whether costs should be assessed against the plaintiffs because the two motions served by the plaintiffs were not filed at the Court House prior to the return date as required by the Queen's Bench Rules;  the motion filed at the Court House was not served on the defendants; plaintiff's counsel advised the defendants that the two motions which had been served on them were not in fact going to proceed. HELD: Given the lawyer's representation as to the amount of stress he was under, it would not be appropriate in the circumstances to assess costs against the plaintiffs over the conduct of their counsel or against counsel directly or at this time. The matter was left to the trial judge."
"The accused was charged with break and enters of homes and was denied involvement. After hearing evidence from the home owners, co-accused and peace officers who investigated the incidents, the Crown advised the court of its intention to call one Ace Carlos Whitecap to the witness box. Defence counsel objected on this basis, arguing that the Crown had ambushed him and his client and that they should not be permitted to do so. The Crown counsel argued that although the Crown's specific intention was to call Whitecap as a witness had not been disclosed to the defence and therefore, he would not be able to cross-examine effectively or at all. HELD: The accused was not permitted to give evidence in this trial. A stay of proceedings was ruled out. The accused's right to full answer and defence had been prejudiced only with respect to the cross-examination of Whitecap. The court found that a stay was out of the question as the accused had not succeeded in preventing the Crown from calling this witness. It was not appropriate to refuse to allow the Crown to call this witness and the court ordered a stay in proceedings.","The accused was charged with a number of break and enters. After hearing evidence, the Crown advised the Court that it intended to call 'Ace' to the stand. Ace had been subpoenaed and had been sitting in the Court listening to other Crown witnesses. Defence counsel objected and claimed the Crown had not disclosed this witness. Ace was also a client of defence counsel and so defence counsel would not be able to cross-examine Ace. HELD: The Crown failed to provide proper disclosure to defence counsel, the non-disclosure had an adverse effect of the accused's ability to make full answer in defence and the appropriate remedy was to refuse to allow the Crown to call Ace as a witness."
The agency applied for an order of permanent care and custody with no provision for access to the child. The mother opposed the application and requested an order returning the child to her care. The biological father who had minimal contact with the child was added as a party to the order. The Agency alleged that the child had been in the care of the mother for several years and that her relationship with the mother had been marked by problems due to her explosive temper and her repeated moves around the house. The father had previously been considered parent or guardian pursuant to s. 36(1)(b) and 3(1) of the Child Protection Act. The agency alleged that under the current arrangements the child would be placed in with the biological father residing with the parent and receiving care from a psychological father and that the biological mother would be unable to contact the child due to the mother's explosive temper. The psychological father opposed the applications and requested that the agency return the child who had been placed in its care. HELD: The burden of proof in proceeding such as this was on the Agency. It was a civil burden of burden that must have regard to the seriousness of the consequences of the decision.,"The Agency applied for permanent care of a young child, with no access to the parents. Each of the mother, the biological father and the psychological father sought to have the child placed in their care. The child had been apprehended due to unsafe and unhealthy living conditions. The mother and psychological father no longer lived together and for the past few months, the mother had been maintaining a clean and tidy apartment and attempting to improve her education and had taken parenting courses. The psychological father, with whom the mother had ended a tumultuous relationship, wanted the child returned to his care, stating that he planned on residing with the mother who would assist him in caring for the child. The mother was against this plan. The biological father only reappeared on the scene after the child was taken into care and acknowledged that the child did not know him as her father. Child placed in the permanent care of the Agency with no access to the mother or the psychological father; access ordered to the biological father for a period of six months at which time the access order will expire automatically unless an application to vary is made; the Agency is to arrange for a parental capacity assessment of the biological father. The child continued to be at substantial risk of physical harm due to neglect if she was returned to the mother's care and the child would be at risk of exposure to violence if returned to the psychological father's care due to the tumultuous relationship between the mother and him. Although some improvements had recently been made in the mother's life, she had a history of frequent changes of residence and did not appear able put the child's needs ahead of her own. The Agency had not had an opportunity to assess the appropriateness of a placement with the biological father."
"FIAT: The Court must guard against the pursuit of what have been termed 'fishing expeditions' --speculative quests for information without any real expectation about the outcome of the quest or its relevance to the case. Here, the defence has already indicated that issues around s. 8 and s. 9 of the Charter will be raised at trial. HELD: The Crown shall make timely disclosure of: (a) the number of stops made by the RCMP in each of the years 2002, 2003 and 2004; (b) the reason for each stop; (c) the reasons for each stopped; (d) Specifics of any other grounds for searches that were applied and how many times; (f) Specific information of any additional grounds for those searches that had been applied and many times. The Notes will presumably supply some details of the required disclosure as well as some details relating to the required disclosures. The notes will presumably provide some details as to the reasons behind each stop.",FIAT: The defence has indicated that issues around s. 8 and s. 9 of the Charter will be raised at trial. Defence now wants further disclosure of information that relate to those important issues. HELD: Further disclosure is ordered. The names of the drivers stopped will not be disclosed and the actual notes of the officer are not ordered to be produced.
"The wife commenced divorce proceedings in November 2004.She sought custody, access, child support, spousal support and costs with a division of property in accordance with the Separation Agreement entered into between her and the husband in August 2004. The husband sought a variation of the provisions regarding child support and child support. It was his position that the particulars of the agreement did not and do not now reflect his net business income derived from self employment. He sought an increase in access. The mother argued the husband had failed to negotiate a mobility restriction clause which he assumed would protect his interests. HELD: 1) The Separation agreement was entered into to assure that his child would not be removed from his home town and that he was prepared to give her his equity in the home and possessions and guarantee her enough money per month to ensure she remained in the matrimonial home with his son. 2) The agreement clearly favours the mother. The father agreed to the terms of their agreement but did not ensure he was fully protected by overtly addressing mobility. There was no evidence of undue influence, fraud or evidence that would affect the ability to retain and instruct counsel. 3) The court ought not to interfere with the agreement between the parties. However, in light of the fact that there are significant changes in the circumstances of the parties, the court could not intervene. 4) The parties had entered into a separation agreement which purported to settle all matters between them and was to be incorporated into and form part of the Corollary Relief Judgement.","The wife sought to have the terms of the parties' separation agreement incorporated into the corollary relief judgment following a four year marriage. The husband sought to vary the provisions of the agreement regarding spousal and child support on the basis that the particulars of the agreement did not reflect his net business income derived from self-employment. The husband argued that he had entered into the separation agreement (which provided for joint custody of their young child, gave the wife all of the matrimonial assets with the exception of the husband's vehicle, and provided for spousal support in the amount of $600 per month for 15 years) only as an attempt to have the wife stay in the local area with the child. The wife had since moved with the child to New Brunswick where she was living with her parents and attending university; she was renting out the matrimonial home. Pursuant to the current court order, she was contributing the sum of $140 per month to the husband's access costs. Husband's current income set and child support awarded; the husband shall be responsible for 50 percent of the after tax child care costs; an additional $300 of spousal support ordered per month while the child remains in New Brunswick to address the access costs in the mother's budget; spousal support is reviewable in the event that these circumstances change, and at any rate, upon the completion of the mother's current degree; the mother shall not remove the child from the Province of New Brunswick to live in any other province without the father's consent. Although the court could not interfere with the agreement under s. 29 of the Matrimonial Property Act, the spousal and child support geared at keeping the wife in the local area and ensuring that her needs were addressed had all changed and a new arrangement was necessary to reflect the access costs among other issues. The wife had chosen to move away from child care services provided by the family that were practically free, as well as significant financial support and the ability to work in the furniture business with her father-in-law; she was not now pursuing a line of education which would build on her previous skills. Her educational expenses ought not be the basis for assessing spousal support and the duration of support set out in the separation agreement far exceeded what might be imposed by a court given the years they were together and their income disparity. The court reviewed the husband's history of income and expenses in setting his income for child support purposes."
"The petitioner sought child support and spousal support pending trial. The parties signed a separation agreement and interspousal contract in July 2004. The agreement provides that the respondent shall pay one half of the net income to the petitioner by way of equal monthly payments of support. The amount of payment shall be adjusted yearly to reflect the changing income of the parties. The respondent has no resources to pay back any interim support received. The petitioner seeks to set aside the settlement agreement on the grounds of undue influence and duress or alternatively that the agreement was unfair and unconscionable. HELD: 1)The agreement stipulated that the petitioner's gross income should not be extrapolated from the amount of child support payable in the event of a material change in circumstances. This was not an appropriate case in which to make an order for interim support.  2)The petitioner was entitled to support under the agreement and the circumstances as they presently existed. She would proceed to pre-trial conference and trial if necessary on the question of whether the respondent is obliged to pursue work in his field as a computer consultant. 3)The parties had signed a comprehensive agreement which dealt with parenting issues, child support, and the division of family property. The sole source of revenue was revenue earned by the respondent's efforts as computer consultant in 2005. In 2006 the respondent earned income of $125,000. In 2007 the respondent was employed with an annual salary of $100,000 and received severance packages of $74,038. 4)The respondent's income was $53,000 less the actual expenses incurred to earn that income. The actual amount of the expenses were somewhat more or somewhat less than the actual amount. 5)There were no circumstances in which the petitioner sought to vary the respondent’s s. 7.3 and 7.5(f) contract in which it was assumed that he would earn $65,000 per annum while attending the program.  6)Costs remained at the table.","The petitioner seeks child and spousal support. The parties signed a separation agreement and interspousal contract in July 2004. With respect to spousal support the agreement provides that it is the intention of the parties that spousal support will be based on a division of income until July 1, 2011.HELD: 1) The petitioner seeks a spousal support order in which the court is asked to impute income and then apply the provisions of their interspousal contract to determine quantum. The interspousal contract does not contemplate variation of the spousal support obligation in the event of a material change of circumstance. It will be for the trial judge to determine the intention of the parties when the agreement makes reference to the adjustments which 'will consider Technologies likely future earnings based upon whether Paul's contract is renewed with the Provincial Government'. This is not an appropriate case in which to make an order for interim spousal support. The petitioner is entitled to support under the agreement and in the circumstances as they presently exist. 2) With regard to child support, there is no question that Melanie remains a child of the marriage while she is attending her educational program. Insofar at the respondent's income is concerned, the gross income to the corporation is $65,000 per year. The respondent provided a pay stub for May 2006. It is not really a pay stub, but extrapolating from that statement the court concluded that the respondent's gross taxable income from the corporation as a result of the $65,000 contract is approximately $53,000. Child support will be ordered based on $53,000 on an interim basis."
"The petitioner asks the court to vary the child support order granted the day after the Justice R.D. Maher changed the primary residence from the petitioner to the respondent. The respondent argues that there has been a clear declaration in two separate writings of the oldest child's desire to have primary residence change from her father to her mother. Further, there is some evidence that the younger child wishes to also live with her mother or, at the least, live in the same residence as her older sister. HELD: The application is dismissed. 1)As no material change has been demonstrated, this application must be dismissed. 2)As little change has actually been demonstrated the Court must be satisfied that there was a material change in the circumstances of the child since the last custody order was made. 3)As the evidence before the Court was too much conflict on the affidavits, a hearing was often ordered. 4)As there was no material difference in the situation the Court found that the respondent's application must not be dismissed as there was not a material one.","The respondent applies for an order varying the custody order by changing the primary residence from the petitioner to the respondent. HELD: 1) The present circumstances are remarkably similar to the circumstances in Bzowey v. Bzowey, 2005 SKQB 12. In both cases, the Court is asked to make the change based solely on the wishes of the child. There is even evidence from the custody and access report from 2005 that the children, or at least the older child, Jill, expressed similar sentiments about living with her mother. It cannot even be strenuously argued that the wishes of the child, Jill, have in fact changed. Those considerations were before the Court in the form of the custody and access report when the decision was made in 2005. 2) The Court should be loathe to make a variation order solely on the expressed wishes of a child of 11 or 12 years of age without some evidence as to why that current expression of interest has been stated. It may well be that the child truly does wish a change. It may also be that the child, as was referred to in the custody and access report, may be simply reflecting the views and therefore the pressures placed on the child by the non-custodial parent. 3) No evidence has been put forward about the negative impact of the continuation of the current order. There is no information before the Court to suggest that the current situation is no longer in the best interests of the children. No material change has been demonstrated. The application is dismissed."
"FIAT: This is an application to determine interim parenting for the child. There is conflicting affidavit evidence respecting the nature and extent of the father's parenting duties while the parties lived together. The mother, Lesly, has chosen to move to Victoria to attend school. She applies as the primary parent to have the child with her. The issues of parenting and mobility are clearly unresolved and may go to trial. HELD: 1) The residence status quo in this case is Regina and Kaira shall, pending trial, reside in Regina. The primary parent status quo is Lesly. Lesly has chosen not to take school in Victoria but that does not mean that even if Lesly is theprimary parent that the child will continue to live in Regina or that she will have regular contact with each parent alternating each week. However it is fair that Lesly contribute something to this cost. 2) Lesly shall pay for each occasion that Kairsa travels to Victoria for parenting time with Lesly but only for the trip from Regina to Victoria. 3) Costs in the cause.","FIAT: This is an application to determine interim parenting for the child, Kaira, who is 2.5 years old. There is conflicting information about the nature and extent of the petitioner father's parenting duties. The respondent has chosen to move to Victoria to attend school. She applies as the primary parent to have the child go with her. The petitioner would like Kaira to remain in Saskatchewan and have regular contact with each parent on alternating weeks. HELD: 1) The residence status quo in this case is Regina and Kaira shall, pending trial, reside in Regina. The Court cannot determine on conflicting affidavits what the primary parent status quo is. 2) It is in the best interest that the child see both parents. There was a similar course in Saskatoon that the respondent could have taken which would have made more frequent changes possible, but her affidavit indicates she thinks the Saskatoon course is inferior to the one she is taking in Victoria. 3) Pending trial the child shall be parented by the petitioner for 28 days, and thereafter by the respondent for 28 days and such parenting shall continue to alternate for each 28 day period thereafter until further order. The costs of transportation shall be born primarily by the respondent."
"The accused is facing a 24 count indictment generally associated with allegations of involvement in the sale of controlled substances and matters ancillary thereto. This motion, under s.7, 11(d) and 24 of the Charter of Rights and Freedoms, is for an order that the accused be provided with full disclosure in useable format. The issues are whether full disclosure that would allow the accused to provide a full answer and defence has been provided; and whether the format of disclosure was appropriate. HELD: 1) The accused is entitled to hard copies of all documents filed by the defence. Given the nature of the organization of the data by the Crown, the cost of obtaining the police officers' notebooks in full, in chronological order for pre-trial examination and trial cross-examination is significant. However, the day will come when the ability to operate personal computers and retrieve data stored on computer disks and related media by means of software programs designed for general public use will be core competency requirement for counsel who wish to act in cases involving voluminous amounts of data. It appears that that day has come. The disclosure provided to date has been reasonably accessible and in a reasonably accessible manner. It is appropriate to embark upon a Laporte inquiry and make the appropriate order on the materials filed. 2) There is no need for the Crown to provide copies of any officers’ notebooks in hard copy and chronological order that postdates the laying of the charges or the issuance of search warrants, whichever is dated later. In this case, the Crown should provide hard copy of the notes made by police officers in their notebooks. The notebooks of those officers who will be testifying at trial are to be provided to the defence in a hard copy in a fashion that is reasonably accessible. In some cases, it would be by way of electronic disclosure or, in some situations, combination of the two. There is the skill, sophistication and equipment to access the electronic data. 3) In all other respects, the nature and format of the disclosure provided thus far is appropriate in that it has been providing in a reasonable accessible manner that does not detract from the right of the defence to make full answer.","The accused is faced with a 24 count indictment associated with allegations of involvement in the sale of controlled substances. The motion, made pursuant to s. 7, 11 and 24 of the Charter of Rights is for an order that the accused 'be provided with full disclosure in a useable format'. The motion has two components. The first relates to the method in which disclosure has been provided, the 'useable format'. The second is whether full disclosure that would allow the accused to provide a full answer and defence has been provided.  The second issue is to be dealt with by a 'Laporte inventory', name for the procedure in R. v. Laporte (1993), 113 Sask. R. 34 (C.A.).HELD: 1) There are some 30,000 to 40,000 pages of disclosure made to the defence. In addition, there are 275 audio file, 50 video files and a large series of photos. The defence seeks photocopies of all officers' notebooks organized by date and officer. The basis of the defence's argument is firstly, equality of use or a level playing field should be created with respect to the provision of documents used by the Crown and, secondly, trial fairness requires the particulars of the police officers' notes be provided in the format requested. The defence argues that if the Crown is going to be using paper copies of some documentation because it finds that use more convenient and effective, then the defence should be provide with the same paper copies to level the playing field. 2) The defence has candidly advised that the issue surrounding the defence of a serious drug charge usually starts with the validity of the search warrant, and the information used by the police in obtaining the search is crucial, not just the information that was provided to the official issuing the warrant but any information that may have been withheld. The affidavits in support of the search warrants in this case are easily found in the database, and cross- referencing to the police officers' notes in support of that information is available. What is not easily available and, for the purposes of the Crown, not relatively important is the balance of the information that may have been obtained by the officer not disclosed by affidavit. This information is often crucial for the defence. 3) In this case, given the nature of the charges, the number of police officers involved in the investigation leading up to the issuance of the warrants and cost of obtaining hard copies, the Crown should provide hard copies of the notes made by police officers in the notebooks. It is ordered that the notebooks of those officers who will be testifying at trial are to be provided to the defence in hard copy in chronological order. In all other respects, the nature and format of the disclosure provided to date is appropriate in that it has been provided in a reasonably accessible manner which does not detract from the right of the accused to make full answer and defence.  4) A useful discussion of electronic disclosure and the issues involved is found in R. v. Piaskowski, 2007 MBQB 68, in which the Court reviews extensively the use of electronic disclosure as opposed to paper disclosure."
"The landlord appealed a decision of the hearing officer of the Residential Tenancies Office. The hearing officer found that she did not have the jurisdiction to deal with the matter and the landlord appealed. Appeal dismissed; the notice to vacate was served on the landlord. The landlord alleged that the Hearing Officer erred in law by failing to make an order for possession of the rental unit. The tenant sought an Order for Possession pursuant to s. 70 of the residential Tenancies Act, 2006. HELD: The appeal was dismissed. 1)The hearing officer made no error in law in finding that there was no valid tenancy agreement between the landlord and the tenant.  2)The Act applies to tenancy agreements and to circumstances where rental units or residential property is validly rented by a landlord to a tenant. 3)The tenants had entered a written tenancy agreement in good faith. There was no breach of trust by either party.  4)The tenancy agreement was invalid because the landlord did not provide sufficient notice to the tenant as required by s.7(f)(i) and s.8(f) of the terms of the agreement. 5)The Hearing Officer did not err in determining that the tenant was entitled to the rights that the lease affords. 6)The tenant was not prejudiced.","The appellant landlord and mother appeals from a decision of the Hearing Officer of the Office of the Residential Tenancies dismissing her claim for possession. The landlords are mother and son. The mother lives out of province for a number of years. She returns in summers to reside in the premises. This year she wanted to return to her premises on a full time basis. She found that her son had rented out a portion of the house to a Tenant and had signed a 3 year lease. She sought an order that the Tenant vacate the premises. The Hearing Officer found he had no jurisdiction to deal with the dispute between the two landlords. He found he could only deal with the situation between the landlords and the tenant and found that the tenant had signed a lease in good faith and is entitled to the rights the lease affords and is entitled to remain in the premises. HELD: There was no valid tenancy agreement. The Act only applies to tenancy agreements and to circumstances where rental units or residential property is validly rented by a landlord to a tenant. In the circumstances, the Hearing Officer did not have jurisdiction to deal with this dispute. However, the Hearing Officer did err in law in determining that the tenant was entitled to the rights that the lease affords. 1) A room in a house is a rental unit capable of being the subject of a tenancy. 2) Clearly there was no participation by both owners in entering into this lease agreement. Mr. Koch's evidence would lead to the opposite conclusion. There was no express consent of principal and agent.  3) The facts as described by the Hearing Officer do not support an agency by estoppel. This can arise where one person has acted so as to lead another to believe that he or she has authorized a third person, without any actual authority, to act on his behalf and that other person, in such belief, enters into a transaction with that third person. The tenant here was not aware that the mother was an owner and the mother did not lead the tenant to believe that her son was authorized to act on her behalf."
"The parties, who were together for seven years, were permanently separated. Now, the petitioner seeks access to their 11 year old daughter from an earlier relationship. The petitioner alleges that because he is a'step-parent' to the child, he does not need to establish that he falls within the category of persons having a'sufficient interest' to bring this application. HELD: 1) The petitioner has already had to contend with multiple parents and multiple siblings, many of whom have been only temporary or fleeting personalities in her life. The court must consider the quality of the relationship, the personality, character and emotional needs of the child and whether the relationship is one that is represented to the world by the mother and the father. The respondent has demonstrated that he is capable of providing that much in the way that he did during the seven years they lived together. While they lived with one parent and one sister, their relationship spanned the years 2000 to 2007. The relationship lasted some time and included the birth of their two youngest children. 2) In this case, the respondent demonstrated he was a person of sufficient interest with respect to the petitioner. The evidence showed that he had a close relationship with the petitioner while she lived with her mother and that he stood in the place of parent to her. 3) The respondent's evidence did not support his contention that he was disadvantaged by the relationship between the petitioner and his two half-siblings. It was more evidence that the petitioner had a stronger sense of entitlement to access the petitioner that would warrant an order for access.","The parties were in a relationship for over 5 years though they never married. The petitioner now seeks access to the respondent's daughter from an earlier relationship. The parties' relationship was tumultuous and included some incidents of domestic violence, which the child may have been exposed to. There are concerns regarding the interactions between the respondent's daughter and the petitioner's own children. The petitioner must establish, firstly, that he has 'sufficient interest' to bring this application, per s. 6(1) of The Children's Law Act, 1997. HELD: The application for access is dismissed. In determining whether a non-family applicant is a person with a sufficient interest, the Court must consider a variety of factors including: the extent or degree of the applicant's involvement in the child's life, the duration of that involvement, the level of intimacy and the quality of the relationship between the applicant and the child, how the relationship between the applicant and the child was represented to the world, and whether the applicant provided financially for the child. The petitioner has demonstrated that he is a person of sufficient interest; the relationship between the parties was not short and, during its lifespan, the petitioner formed a close bond with the child and was involved with her life. The community viewed them generally as father and daughter. However, the Court cannot conclude that requiring the child to visit the petitioner would be of any benefit to her. This child has already had to contend with multiple 'fathers' and multiple 'siblings', many of whom have been only temporary or fleeting personalities in her life. The confusion that this has no doubt caused her should not be further compounded by requiring her to make even more adjustments in her understanding of what 'family' means. Access to the petitioner is not in the best interests of this child."
"The accused is charged with 21 counts under an indictment dated September 1, 2010 consisting of one count of attempted murder, several charges pertaining to the unlawful possession and use of a firearm, and a number of status offences based on a pre-existing firearm prohibition order. The charges relate to events which occurred between April 8 and April 14, 2010 respectively. The accused seeks severance of the 21 counts in the indictment on two bases which, if granted, would require three separate trials in all. The first proposed basis is that the firearm which assumes an unproven connection of possession of the gun on both days would be admissible on a basis that the accused's decision whether to testify would more likely than not be the same in relation to both sets of counts. HELD: The application for severance is dismissed on both the bases proposed. The interests of justice encompass the accused’s right to be tried on the evidence admissible against him, as well as society's interest in seeing justice is done in reasonably efficient and cost-effective manner. Whatever use was made of the firearm on April 8 would not touch on who might have had knowledge and control of it on April 14. The videotaped statement to police was common piece of evidence to both events. On an application to sever a multi-count indictment, the overarching criteria are the interests and justice of justice. It is important to note that Litchfield, where the Crown was prevented from arguing the case properly because of an unjudicial severance order, does not necessarily be a better ground of departure for the accused because of the multiplicity of offences and the fact that the interests, especially in the context of justice, require a trial on one or more of the counts.","The accused, who was charged with 21 counts under one indictment relating to events on two separate dates, applied to have the counts severed. First, on the basis of the dates of the occurrences and, secondly, to separate the so-called 'status offences' based on a pre-existing firearm prohibition order. It was argued the Crown had combined all the counts into one indictment to improve its evidentiary position with regard to the unproven connection of possession of the gun on the two separate dates and to be able to cross-examine the accused on the events of both days should he choose to only testify on the events of one day. The Crown argued that expert evidence showing a match between the gun used in the shooting on the first date and that found by the arresting officers on the second date showed a temporal and continuity nexus between the two events. The accused's  videotaped statement to the police was also a common piece of evidence to both dates. Application for severance dismissed. The most significant issue was the possibility of the accused being subject to cross-examination for events of both days if he chose to testify only concerning the events of one day but his position that he had no association with the gun and that it was not in his possession on either day indicated that his decision on whether to testify would most likely be the same in relation to both sets of counts and, given that there was no jury involved, there was no risk of improper inferences being drawn. The Crown should not be limited in the presentation of its evidence through a severance of counts because of the tenuous nexus between the two events."
"FIAT. The respondent sought an order for interim spousal support. HELD: The Court concluded that relief should be granted but in the circumstances it should not take the form of maintenance. Section of land owned by the petitioner was valued at $293,874. The difference in value relates to a section of land which the respondent brought into the marriage. The petitioner's share of the 1998 crop has value of $16,000. The fact remains that the respondent is in the position of not being able to obtain suitable shelter on his own and that is deplorable. The Court ordered the respondent to pay $500 per month. In the alternative, the petitioner should receive half of his income from the sale of an off-setting asset which could be sold and reduced loan payments would result. The $10,000 should be paid to the respondent by monthly payments in the amount of $500. The remaining monies should be left to the petitioner with no obligation to make the indicated payments.","The respondent seeks an order for interim spousal support. The parties were married in January 1991 with three children and ceased to cohabit in December of 1996. The respondent is 52 years old and unemployed. In the past, he has been diagnosed as paranoid schizophrenic and suffering from a personality disorder but is currently, according to his physician, of sound mind. He qualifies since 1987 for a disability pension under CPP by reason of his mental disability which provides for a basic income of $580 plus GTS rebate for a total of $630 per month. The petitioner lives on a section of farm land which was brought into the marriage by the respondent, of which one quarter contains the matrimonial home. The petitioner and children live in that home. The petitioner is 39 years old and is also unemployed because she is an incomplete quadriplegic. The farm land is rented out from which the petitioner receives rental income. The petitioner enjoys an income of $3,400 per month while the respondent receives $630 per month. HELD: The petitioner is ordered to pay the respondent the annual sum of $6,000 paid in monthly installments of $500. There is no juridical reason why the petitioner should obtain the total revenue owned by the respondent particularly when he brought the land into the marriage. In fact, fairness and equity would suggest just the opposite, at least in respect to one half of the revenue. Accordingly, the Court makes an order on the basis of the respondent's ownership of the land rather than order payment of spousal support."
"The two accused were charged on separate informations with assaulting the complainant contrary to s. 266 of the Criminal Code and with wilfully damaging the windows of a car. HELD: The accused were found not guilty of the first count on information 24414281.  1) The physical altercation in this case was precipitated by jealousy or by a drug deal gone bad. There is no doubt that the accused were the aggressors throughout. He smashed in one, if not two, car windows. He chased after the complainant with Dagenais' help. Once at the trailer he rushed up the stairs toward the complainant. This was threatening behaviour and the complainant said he felt threatened. 2) The accused admitted to hitting the complainant three times in the face. They both admitted to breaking the window of the complainant's car.  3) The Court found that both accused were justified in using force to defend themselves or any one under protection from assault if he uses no more force than is necessary to prevent the assault or the repetition of it. The Court also found that the second count was justified because the complainant choked him at one point during the altercation.","The accused were both charged with assault contrary to s. 266. The complainant admitted that he threw the first punch but said that he did so because the male accused had already broken the windows in his car and punched his passenger and was not 'coming to apologize.' HELD: The accused were convicted of assault. Whether the physical altercation was precipitated by jealousy or a drug deal, there is no doubt that the accused was the aggressor throughout. He smashed one, if not two, car windows. The accused's behaviour was threatening and the Court accepted that the accused had not attended the house to apologize. The complainant took necessary and lawful action to protect himself and his family under s. 37 of the Criminal Code.  While the Court did not believe that either complainant used a weapon, if it did occur it would have been justified in the context of the assault. The accused was acquitted of mischief because the Crown failed to prove the value of the broken windows."
"The respondent applies for the dismissal of the plaintiff's claim for want of prosecution pursuant to the inherent powers of the court. The respondent responds through its counsel that it now has every intention to proceed with its action. HELD: 1) A delay of over five years is inexcusable and it does not reach the level of serious prejudice described in the ICC case. However, it is in the interests of justice that the claim proceed to trial notwithstanding the delay.  2) The plaintiff's delay in pursuing its claim is comparable to that experienced by other cases in which the decision to dismiss is discretionary. As was the case in ICC, this case has now seen the completion of all pre-trial steps excepting for the response to certain undertakings given and still outstanding and the scheduling of pre- trial settlement conference. Accordingly, the case is ready to and can proceed without further delay. 3) The delay in excess of five years in advancing this case does constitute inordinate delay when compared to the progress in comparable cases.  4) The onus is on the respondent to convince the court that the facts and circumstances support the conclusion that the delay was excusable. The application for an order returning $40,000 paid by Ochapowace to McDiarmid is not granted. The question of whether or not settlement was reached, the circumstances under which this payment was made are live issues raised by the pleadings. This is an issue that must be determined by the trial judge.","The defendant applied for dismissal of the plaintiff's claim for want of prosecution. The claim was issued November 1, 1999 and is based in debt for goods and services provided to the defendant. The value of the claim is $521,283.99 and refers to provision of materials, products and services in 1995 and 1996. The statement of defence was filed November 12, 1999 and amended in 2002. In the intervening years, the Chief of the defendant Indian Band died as did the person who had been appointed the proper person to be examined on behalf of the defendant.HELD: The decision to dismiss an application for want of prosecution is discretionary. A three step process was set out in International Capital Corporation v. Robinson Twigg &amp; Ketilson et al., 2010 SKCA 48. In this case, a delay of in excess of 5 years does not constitute inordinate delay when compared to the progress in comparable cases. The amount claimed is significant and there is no suggestion in the amended defence that the goods, products and related services were not provided. Subject to compliance with undertakings, the matter is ready to be referred to pre-trial settlement conference. There is no legal excuse offered on the part of the plaintiff for the inordinate delay in this case. The plaintiff bears the onus of convincing the Court on a balance of probabilities that the delay was excusable and its materials fall short. While there may be some prejudice to the defendant in mounting a defence because of the death of some of the people who were intimately involved in the dealings between the parties, there is an individual available who is intimately familiar with the dealings between the parties and there are discovery transcripts that might be of assistance. Both parties have records and documentation that can be tendered at a trial. The Court concluded that the interest of justice favored continuing with the action. The application to dismiss the action for want of prosecution was denied."
"The parties were married for seven years and had two children, one of which was born of the marriage. The mother was the primary caretaker of the children and her role was to report to the father final decisions about the children's education, health and dental care, and their relationship with the father. The father was to pay a proportionally greater share of the day to day care expenses, plus the pre-marital pension benefits. The parties were to obtain a date on their docket for a return to this court eight months from the date of this decision for a review to determine whether the conflict between the parties has ceased, or at least been substantially reduced, and whether, as a result of that analysis, any change is required to the terms of the order. Children to be in the joint custody of the father and mother. The information provided by the Father and his witnesses in respect to the serious and damaging allegations was credible. It was possible that, after careful review of all of the factors in s9(a), court would come to the conclusion the full table guideline amount is the proper amount of child support. HELD: 1)Section 9(a) requires the court to take the financial situation of both parents into account. The provision does not include a conclusive formula to determine how the table amounts are to be calculated. The role of the court is not to determine which parent is better but to decide which plan for the child's care will best meet the objectives of their children. The court retains the discretion to reduce parent's child support downward from the Guidelines amount if there is no indication the parents would likely overcome the conflict that had arisen between them. 2)Costs in the amount of $50,000 are not to be determined on a case by case basis. 3)There was no evidence that the children needed counseling because of anything their Father had done. The evidence indicated that the father would not place the children in an inadequate care situation. 4)The evidence did not support the idea that the child needed counseling. 5)The court would not order counseling if the children were to suffer irreparable harm.","The parties were married almost nine years and have two children, ages eight and 10.  The mother was highly critical of the father's ability to parent, and opposed his application for shared custody. She accused him of abusive behavior, using drugs/abusing alcohol, and claimed he did not help parent when they lived together. The level of conflict between the two was high. Each lived with new partners. They both filed expense statements showing significant monthly deficits but, since they had declared bankruptcy, there was no evidence of how they were meeting the shortfall. The mother sought a share of the father's pension, including his pre-marriage contributions, spousal support and child support. She worked through most of the marriage, but earned a lot less than the father did. Interim shared parenting, with a review in eight months. This is not an ideal arrangement, but the alternatives will leave the children worse off. The father was more credible; the mother's allegations are unsubstantiated. While he's contributed to the conflict in the past, he is making an effort while the mother and her partner are not. The mother will have the final say on health related matters, and the father will have the final say on the choice of childcare and helping with homework (because he is francophone and better able to help). If the mother is unable to learn how to work with the father, the court will consider awarding him custody. On review, the court will consider the parties' ability to communicate and cooperate, including whether or not they are able to agree about extracurricular activities for the children. The father will pay child support in the set-off amount. While he has twice her income, the mother hasn't proven the set-off amount is insufficient to enable her to meet the children's needs while they're with her. It's impossible to have a deficit without disclosing the debt instruments used to support debt accumulation. Her partner is either meeting her shortfall or her expenses are overstated. It would be unfair and unconscionable to award her half of the pre-marriage pension contributions based on the length of the marriage and the fact she wasn't economically dependant on the father. She's not entitled to spousal support. Even if she was, the father has no ability to pay given his obligations to the children."
"The Crown applied pursuant to s. 752.1(1) of the Code for an order remanding the accused for an assessment performed by an expert for use as evidence in an application to have the accused declared a dangerous offender. The accused had been convicted of assaulting a peace officer. The offence had a serious personal injury offence, which included 58 Criminal Code convictions. There were also 10 convictions on it for violent offences, six of which related to peace officers. The offender had violated his mandatory supervision orders on three separate occasions and been recommitted to the Penitentiary and breached a conditional sentence order once. The crimes of violence for which the accused has been convicted include the assault of a police officer which occurred when he was cornered by two officers and a large tree branch which was about seven feet long and three-quarters to two inches in diameter. The police officer fired his taser at the accused, coming so close to the officer that it caused him to back away and pull his sidearm. At paragraph 41 of the judgment, the Crown referred to R. v. Ponticorvo, 2009 SKQB 350 (CanLII), in which the Court held that a penitentiary sentence was warranted given the level of personal injury and the fact that the accused did not engage in conduct endangering or likely to endanger the life or safety of either officer. In this case, the accused was sentenced to a term of 10 years for the violent offences and the sentences were varied to reflect the time period between the offence and the sentencing. The Crown sought a sentence of at least 10 years imprisonment for the offences. HELD: The court found that given the serious nature of the offence, the prospect of the accused being found to be dangerous or long-term offender was within the realm of possibility or beyond it. The court ordered the accused to undergo an assessment on the basis of evidence established by the Court and the facts of the case.","The accused was found guilty on a charge of assaulting a police officer contrary to s. 270.01(1) of the Criminal Code. The Crown applied under s. 752.1(1) for an order remanding the accused for an assessment by an expert for use as evidence in an application to have the accused declared a dangerous offender. The defence opposed the application on the basis that the predicate offence was not a serious personal injury offence and it was not within the realm of possibility that the accused could be found to be a dangerous offender. The accused was 50 years old. He had a criminal record commencing in 1976 which included 58 Criminal Code convictions. Fifteen of his prior convictions were for violent offences and six related to police officers. He had violated mandatory supervision orders on three separate occasions and had breached a conditional sentence order. The crimes of violence on his record involved the use of a weapon on more then one occasion. The facts of the predicate offence involved swinging a branch at a police officer. The officer had tasered the accused, but it had no effect. The accused grabbed a branch and swung it in sufficient proximity to cause the officer to back up, drop his taser and draw his sidearm. The officer provided a victim impact statement outlining the fear he experienced and the psychological impact the offence had on himself and his family. HELD: The offence is a serious personal injury offence as defined in s. 752. The accused picked up the branch with the intention of using it against the officer and it was of sufficient size that if the accused had struck the officer it would have caused serious damage. The accused's actions were found to have endangered or been likely to endanger the officer's life or safety and to have inflicted or been likely to inflict severe psychological damage. Given the number and nature of violent offences on the accused's record, the fact that many of the offences involve violence against police officers and the accused's prolonged issues with alcohol, a pattern of behaviour has been established. The best predictor of future behaviour is past behaviour and there is likelihood that the accused will cause injury in the future. The accused has demonstrated indifference to the reasonably foreseeable consequences to other persons of his behaviour. Given the serious nature of the offence and the accused's prior record for similar offences, a sentence of two years or more is possible.  It is not beyond the realm of possibility that the accused could be found to be a dangerous offender. The assessment under s. 752.1 was ordered."
"The appellant sought to expropriate land which included almost all of the appellant's backyard for the purpose of widening the Bedford Highway. The expropriation resolution was filed at the Registry on September 7, 1993. The effective date of expropriations was September 8, 1993 and the effective date was set in 1994. The appellant received an appraisal report from the respondent's solicitor and in a decision in August 1994 he reduced the account to $14,000 plus taxes. The respondent appealed the decision of the taxing master to abandon the expropriated land retaining only an easement necessary for the footing. At the hearing, the taxmaster awarded $5,855 in full compensation for the appellant interest in the land, which was confirmed by taxation of costs by the tax master. The appellants suggested the taxman disallowed any services that were actually incurred. The taxing Master had reviewed the invoices and there were no records of the invosices. The matter was settled within two years. The appeal was dismissed and the taxation of cost by the Master was confirmed.","The respondent expropriated a parcel of land owned by the appellant. Prior to a hearing, all claims for the case were settled for the sum of $20,000. The appellant's solicitor presented solicitor and client accounts of $19,420 plus taxes. The respondent directed taxation, and the appellant's solicitor submitted further accounts for services and disbursements of the taxation hearing amounting to $7,212.24. The taxing master received expert opinion that a reasonable fee for the services, exclusive of taxation costs, would be $10,000. He proceeded to tax the account at $14,000, disallowed any costs of the taxation hearing, and disallowed a claim for interest on interim accounts submitted by the solicitor. The appellants appealed. Dismissing the appeal and confirming the taxation, that the taxing master did not make any errors in law. He was entitled to consider as one of the relevant factors the relationship of the total account to the recovery."
The accused sought to overturn his conviction for failing to attend court by arguing that the trial judge oughtto have accepted his excuse for not appearing. At issue was whether the accused advanced a 'lawful excuse' for not attending court. HELD: The appeal was allowed on appeal. 1)The trial judge rejected the accused's submission that he had a lawful excuse for failure to attend.  2)The accused's feelings were further bruised by the fact that the original impaired driving charge was stayed by the Crown. 3)The Supreme Court of Canada commented on comments made in R. v. Holmes which indicate that a constructive excuse includes all defences the common law considers sufficient reason to excuse a person from criminal liability. 4)The legislation could be amended to provide new excuses or excuses or by narrowing it to include only certain excuses.,"The accused was charged with failing to appear at his trial on a charge of impaired driving. The impaired driving charge was subsequently stayed. When the charge of failing to appear came on for trial the accused claimed a 'lawful excuse' for his failure to appear on the impaired driving charge. His excuse was that the next shift at work had failed to arrive on time and that this had made it impossible for him to get to court on time. This excuse was rejected and he was convicted. He appealed. HELD: Appeal dismissed.  1)Whether an accused has a lawful excuse is determined with reference to common law principles. It normally includes all of the defences which the common law considers sufficient reason to excuse a person from criminal liability. 2)The Court was unable to say that the finding by the trial judge that the accused had no lawful excuse for failing to attend court, was not supported by the evidence; nor could it say her conclusions were clearly wrong so as to make the decision unreasonable."
"This was an application by the petitioners for a receiving order against the respondent. The petitioner brothers were three brothers from the District of Perdue, Saskatchewan who carry on a family farm operation and operate a family-owned farm implement dealership business. In 1985, the accountant for the respondent advised the brothers that they should become involved in certain real estate partnerships, in order to derive certain tax advantages. They invested in these partnerships in 1989 and 1996. In 1996, the Registrar in Bankruptcy granted an ex parte order directing the respondent to preserve and retain intact and in specie various market securities (the Securities) previously owned by the petitioner and purportedly'seized' by the respondent pursuant to an alleged security interest granted in her favour. In 1997, the respondent filed notice of disputing petition. It was found that the respondent had committed an act of bankruptcy within six months prior to the filing of the petition and that he had failed or refused to pay the indebtedness owed to them. HELD: The receiving order was granted. There was no extenuating circumstances which would warrant the Court refusing to issue the receiving order. The material discloses the very substantial financial hardships visited upon the petitionerers as a result of the respondent's refusal to pay his indebtedness owing by him. No adequate explanation was offered by the Respondent for his failure to pay these obligations. In the circumstances, this act of bankruptcy has been proven.  1)There was no evidence of extensuating circumstances.  2)The petitioner was indebted to the respondent in the amounts claimed. He had ceased to meet his liabilities generally as they became due.  3)The respondent had not made any significant contributions in the amount claimed.","Three brothers who carried on a family farm operation and family farm implement dealership applied for a receiving order against the respondent who had been in two real estate partnerships with them. The Partnerships sustained heavy operating losses since 1989 and the petitioners had made large capital contributions on behalf of the defaulting partners in order to prevent the Partnerships from defaulting on the mortgages. The defaulting partners obtained the benefits of business losses which they used to offset their other sources of income and to decrease their personal income tax liability by significant amounts, obtaining benefits without paying for them. The petitioners alleged that Ashton had committed three acts of bankruptcy within the six months prior to filing the petition including ceasing to pay liabilities as they became due in failing to make payments to the petitioners, making a fraudulent conveyance to his wife and disposing of his property with intent to defraud or defeat his creditors by permitting his interest in the Securities to be purportedly seized by his wife. HELD: A receiving order was granted. 1)No adequate explanation was offered by Ashton who was a wealthy individual for his failure to pay his partnership obligations. It was common ground that Ashton had paid nothing toward his partnership obligations since 1993. The defendant admitted that he was indebted to the petitioners in the amount of approximately $278,758 and that he had received substantial tax advantages as a result of his involvement in the two partnerships.  2)The majority of the respondent's wealth consisted of the Securities purportedly seized by his wife in 1996. The preservation order was continued for 30 days to permit the Trustee in Bankruptcy to determine whether the bankruptcy estate wished to challenge these transactions."
"FIAT. Both parents wanted sole custody of their son. Since they separated in June of 1997, the boy had lived alternating weeks with each parent. HELD: The father's obligation under the Federal Child Support Guidelines was $226 per month. He asked the mother to share the extraordinary cost of $40 per month for the boy's horse riding lessons which were very reasonable. The mother's proportional share of $28 per month was withheld. If the parties could not agree when the event took place, they were given leave to apply for further directions. There will be no order for costs.","FIAT. Both parents sought sole custody of the one child who had been living alternate weeks with each since June 1997. HELD: 1)The present shared parenting arrangement was to continue until the mother was available for full-time child care. The father would have access on alternating weekends and for a three hour period one weekday provided the child was returned by the bedtime set by the mother. Although both parents genuinely love the child and were equally competent caregivers, neither demonstrated that sole parenting offered an advantage to him. Both had full time jobs. 2)When the mother assumes sole custody the father must pay child support of $226 per month and proportionate share of horse riding lessons ($28 per month)."
An application for orders of certiorari and mandamus concerning a decision by a Youth Court judge not to appoint counsel to represent a young person. The issue was whether the Court had discretion to refuse having regard to the provisions of s. 11(4) of the Young Offenders Act. HELD: The application was dismissed. 1)The judge did not err in refusing to direct the applicant have counsel appointed to him.  He had no jurisdiction to decline the request.  2)The Youth Court's discretion to determine inability is not limited solely to considerations of financial inability. Inability may be asserted for other reasons and the court is entitled to inquire into the foundation.,An application for certiorari and mandamus. In issue is whether the Youth Court judge has the discretion to refuse to appoint counsel to represent a young person having regard to the provisions of s.11(4) of the Young Offenders Act. The meaning of the word 'unable' in s.11(4)(b) was in issue. The youth was facing a variety of charges including failure to comply with conditions of an undertaking; failure to attend court; possession of property obtained by crime; obstructing a police officer. He requested the Youth Court appoint counsel after his Legal Aid lawyer withdrew. Both parents were on social assistance. The matter was adjourned to investigate the possibility of an aunt providing financial assistance but the youth advised in April that she was unable to do so. HELD: The application was dismissed. The Youth Court judge did not err in refusing to direct counsel be appointed. The Youth Court judge's discretion is not limited solely to considerations of financial inability. The youth disentitled himself to continued Legal Aid representation by his own misconduct.
"The appellant appeals a decision of the Board of Inquiry appointed by the Minister of Justice under The Saskatchewan Human Rights Code which found that the appellant continued to discriminate against disabled members of the public by failing to provide access and accessible services to wheelchair users and ordered the appellant to construct or renovate washrooms to meet the accessibility requirements of the National Building Code of Canada 1995. The appellant appeals contending that the Board exceeded its jurisdiction in making the order that it did. HELD: Appeal dismissed. The Board acted entirely within the terms of its original order, an order in which it had retained jurisdiction, to confirm compliance with the order and which had been confirmed by this Court. The extent of the order, that is whether it was confined to external access of the property or to other 'facilities and services', whether it had been complied with is the very question the Board reserved jurisdiction to determine. The original order cannot be challenged at this late date. In the appeal the Board added the company as a party to the proceedings.","A complaint was made in 1991 to the Human Rights Commission that the Gallery could only be entered by stairs and was inaccessible to wheelchair users. A Board of Inquiry appointed under the Saskatchewan Human Rights Code concluded in 1993 that the appellant's complex impeded physical access to the premises, facilities and services and lacked proper amenities for persons who are wheelchair-reliant. The Board specifically ordered it remained seized of the matter and the hearing would be reconvened to hear further evidence. The Court of Queen's Bench confirmed the Gallery continued to discriminate against disabled members of the public by failing to provide access and accessible services and ordered the appellant to construct or renovate washrooms to meet requirements of the National Building Code of Canada. The Court of Appeal set aside the Queen's Bench decision and restored the Board's decision. During those proceedings, the property was transferred to HKR, which undertook further renovations. In 1997 upon request by the Commission, the Board reconvened and concluded there had not been compliance, which was confirmed by the Court of Queen's Bench. This was not appealed. An appeal of the Board's 1998 order to construct or renovate the bathrooms was dismissed and it was found the Board did not err in adding HKR as a party nor exceeded its jurisdiction in finding the appellant had not complied with the original order. The appellant appealed that judgment principally on the ground of error in not finding the Board exceeded its jurisdiction in making the order as the original order did not include a requirement that it construct wheelchair accessible washrooms. HELD: The appeal was dismissed with costs on double Column V. The Queen's Bench judge did not err in finding the appellant could not, at that stage of proceedings, question the original order made by the Board in 1993 (ordering the appellant to cease impeding physical access to the premises, facilities and services). The issue had been previously determined and the order was reinstated by the Court of Appeal. The Board acted entirely within the terms of its original order. It retained jurisdiction to confirm compliance. The original order cannot be challenged at this late date."
"The child protection proceeding in respect of the child who was under the age of six when taken into care was delayed for a number of reasons. The primary child protection concerns that were advanced by the agency were such that the original agency planning for the reunification of the mother and child required some psychological counselling. Counsel for the mother made a motion that based on the rule in B.F. I had lost my jurisdiction and must dismiss the matter. HELD: The motion was dismissed. 1)The Court had not lost its jurisdiction in this matter and the trial was to commence tomorrow. 2)Reapprehension will expose the child to the very delay the deadlines are designed to avoid since each of the stages set out in the Act (interim hearing, protection finding and at least one disposition hearing) will have to run their course, in the absence of consent to consolidation under s40(2) of the Act. 3)When the plan of care changes from reunification to permanent care close to the particular deadline, it is not in a child's best interest for a rushed trial date. There may be need for the preparation of expert reports and other trial preparation and to ascertain whether ongoing further services would have resolved the problem. 4)Any attempt after the trial to make a continued intervention order of any type would not be possible in the circumstances.","The mother moved for the dismissal of the pending permanent care trial, arguing that, applying the reasoning in a recent Court of Appeal decision, the court had lost jurisdiction. No trial had been held on any issue as all matters had proceeded to this point with the consent of the parties. The time for trial had been extended to allow the mother to retain counsel. Application dismissed; the court had not lost jurisdiction; trial to proceed. The Court of Appeal decision stands for the proposition that, once a trial at any stage of the Act is held, no order can have effect beyond the next statutory deadline; however, this is so only when the extensions are included in an order which follows trial. When the best interests of the child require it, an extension of a statutory deadline can be made in order to have a trial completed in respect of any stage of the Act. When the plan of care changes from reunification to permanent care close to the particular deadline, it is not in a child's best interest for the court to order a rushed trial date."
The accused was charged with having the care or control of a motor vehicle while his ability to operate a motor Vehicle was impaired by alcohol or drugs. The accused's evidence raised a reasonable doubt as to his guilt. HELD: The accused was found guilty. 1)The accused's blood alcohol content was.60. The court found that the accused's symptoms of impairment were the result of a panic attack not from the consumption of alcohol. 2)The evidence did not support the defence argument that the signs and symptoms were either consistent with or equally consistent with a Panic attack. The evidence and the evidence of the doctor who had been called to the scene by the accused who was suffering from a generalized anxiety disorder (G.A.D.) did not provide a sufficient basis for the defence.,"The accused was charged with operating a motor vehicle while impaired by alcohol or drug (Code ss.253(a) and 255(1)). The accused admitted to consuming one vodka cooler before driving but argued the signs of impairment were manifestations of his panic attack. No .08 charge was laid, as his readings were .07 and .06. HELD: The accused was found guilty of impaired driving. The evidence did not support the argument that he was in the throws of a panic attack. The blood-alcohol readings show he was below the legal limit but the signs and symptoms of impairment by alcohol proved beyond a reasonable doubt his ability to operate a motor vehicle was impaired by alcohol. As stated in McCallum, the fact that the effects of alcohol may have been exacerbated by the accused suffering from fatigue does not provide a defence to the charge."
"The respondent Board issued an order by way of certiorari pursuant to Rule 664 of the Queen's Bench Rules of Court, quashing the respondent Board's decision to deny the applicant's application for dependent benefits. The applicant had become aware of the potential benefits in early July 2001 during a casual conversation at her workplace and suggested that the respondent should apply for benefits. At the Board's hearing, the applicant was found not to be found dead within the meaning of the Workers' Compensation Act and the application for benefits was denied. The respondent Board applied the test in support of the application and found that it was not found dead. The issues were whether the Board acted outside its jurisdiction in denying benefits based upon the reasons for the delay; whether the respondent board acted outside of its jurisdiction when it determined that the applicant died at work; whether there was any evidence of the suddenness of the symptoms leading up to the death and whether the applicant had any potential entitlement to benefits pursuant to s. 30 of the Act; whether it was appropriate to grant benefits to the applicant in the event of a cause beyond its jurisdiction; whether s. 45 should be allowed in favour of the applicant; whether S. 30 should be permitted in the circumstances; whether certain provisions of the legislation had been violated; whether any of the provisions of s.30 should be made part of the Board’s remit to review the claim. HELD: The application for dependants’ benefits was dismissed. The court found that s.45 should not be allowed because it did not apply to the respondent. The privative clause found in s.22 did not shield the Board from its decision from judicial review when the Board exercises its discretion to decide matters but the legislation did not “intend to commit the matter exclusively to the Board.” Section 45 was not applicable in the context of the respondent’ s.7 Charter case.","The deceased was a master's student who also worked as a student assistant at the University of Saskatchewan. He became ill while teaching a class. His students helped him to the faculty lounge. He was found in the faculty washroom unconscious and not breathing approximately 30 minutes later. Emergency medical technicians were not able to resuscitate him and he was pronounced dead at the Royal University Hospital. An application for dependants' benefits was submitted over 3 years later. The Workers' Compensation Board denied the claim finding that the deceased was not found dead at work and because of the delay in bringing the claim. The applicant brought an application for an order of certiorari pursuant to Queen's Bench Rule 664 and mandamus pursuant to Queen's Bench Rule 674. HELD: 1) The Board acted outside of its jurisdiction in denying dependant benefits to the applicant based upon a determination that the deceased was not found dead within the meaning of s. 30 of The Workers' Compensation Act, 1979. The case law clearly precludes an analysis of s. 30 of the Act as in any way representing a rebuttable presumption. 2) The Board acted outside its jurisdiction in not applying the presumption in s. 30 of the Act in favour of the applicant. 3) The Board waived the right to rely upon the delay in bringing the claim after the Board participated in a variety of levels of proceeding, including two hearings, and only raised the issue of delay at the final hearing. 4) The application was allowed with costs to the applicant on a party and party basis."
"The accused pled guilty to a charge of assault contrary to s. 266 of the Criminal Code and was sentenced to a term of six months imprisonment and to enter into a probation order for a period of 18 months on certain specific conditions. A 10 year firearm, ammunition and explosive substance prohibition order was made against the accused pursuant to the provisions of s. 100(1) of the Code. On September 29, 1994, the accused's application for release from custody was granted by a member of the Court of Appeal pursuant to s81(1)(a) of said Code. The subject appeal against a six-month term of imprisonment and a 10-year firearm prohibition order had been allowed and it was set aside. The accused had now served 15 days of the sentence on him. He commenced serving the noted sentence on August 4, 1994. On August 18, 1994 the accused applied to have the sentence reduced to 'time served'. The appeal against the sentence was allowed and the 18 month probation order was maintained. HELD: Appeal allowed. 1)The sentence imposed was too severe for the particular circumstances and the sentence imposed ought to be reduced to time already served. 2)The accused had not yet commenced serving his sentence. 3)The sentences were reduced to terms of probation subject only to the probation order having regard to the principles of protection of society, deterrence, general and specific deterrence, reformation and rehabilitation and the need to maintain the public's confidence in the administration of justice. 4)In all the circumstances the requisite two pre-conditions did not exist and the Provincial Court judgeerred in making the noted s.100(2) prohibition order.","The Crown elected to proceed summarily and the accused entered a plea of guilty to a charge of assault under S.266 of the Code. He was sentenced to 6 months imprisonment, 18 months probation and a 10 year fire arm prohibition was imposed. He appealed his sentence. HELD: Appeal allowed. 1)Because the accused had no related record and given the circumstances of the assault, the sentence of imprisonment was reduced to time already served (15 days). 2)The trial judge erred in imposing the 10 year fire arm prohibition under S.100 of the Code. S.100 requires a conviction on an indictable offence involving violence against a person where the maximum sentence available is 10 years imprisonment or more. 3)The maximum sentence for assault under S.266 is 5 years if the Crown proceeds by indictment and 6 months if, as here, the Crown proceeds summarily."
"FIAT. Following a trial before me in November 1993, the Courtissued a judgment dealing with a number of issues including the division of matrimonial property. The judgment dealt with the division into two parts: an order directing the respondent to return the list of items referred to above as matrimony property subject to division and an order preventing the respondent from violating the previous order of November that nothing be removed from the matrimonia home or any assets disposed of. HELD: 1)The respondent was ordered to return to the petitioner the list containing the household contents and personal items removed by the respondent in order to allow for aWrit of Delivery. The respondent was also ordered to pay all outstanding utility payments and other expenses associated with his occupation of the home up to and including December 26/1993 as well as any losses experienced as a result of no insurance coverage between September 28/1993 and December 29/1993. 2)The Court was left with no alternative but to assist the petitioner in regaining the assets taken out of the house by granting the order sought subject to one or two modifications.",FIAT Matrimonial property dispute. A previous order had prohibited the removal of any assets from the matrimonial home and the disposal of all other assets. By this fiat an order was granted pursuant to Queen's Bench Rule 344 itemizing the household contents and personal items removed by the respondent from the matrimonial home in order to allow for a Writ of Delivery and prohibiting the respondent from disposing of any of the assets that the respondent had removed from the matrimonial home and also requiring him to pay all outstanding utility payments and other expenses associated with his occupation of the matrimonial home. The judge declined to cite the respondent for contempt.
"The appellant contended that the Provincial Court judge so concerned himself with the question of the credibility of the evidence of the complainant and the accused that he overlooked his duty to consider such evidence with a view to determining whether it raised a reasonable doubt of the appellant's guilt. HELD: The appeal was dismissed. 1)The accused was found guilty only upon the credibilityof the complainant & the accused. He said he found the Crown's evidence to be credible, and the RCMP's evidence not to becredible. 2)The appellant failed to consider the fact that the accused's evidence was comprised of both the complainant and the complainant. 3)The trial judge did not have the duty to take into account all of the other evidence. He did not misplace his duty.","The accused was convicted of assault. He contends that the trial judge so concerned himself with the question of credibility of the complainant and the accused that he overlooked his duty to consider evidence of a witness, 'together with the rest of the evidence, with a view to determining whether it raised a reasonable doubt of the appellant's guilt, irrespective of whether he believed the evidence of the complainant.' HELD: Appeal dismissed and conviction accordingly affirmed.  1)Great deference to findings of credibility made at trial should be shown. 2)The trial judge did not say that he found the accused guilty only upon the credibility of the complainant and the accused. He said that he found the Crown's evidence to be credible, and the accused's evidence not to be credible. The Crown's evidence was comprised of both the complainant and the witness. 3)The trial judge's findings are supported by the evidence and his conclusions are not clearly wrong so as to make the conviction unreasonable."
"HELD: The trial was directed on the issues of the residence of the petitioner mother and the incomes of the father and mother, for the purposes of the Federal Child Support Guidelines and any s. 7 expenses. The respondent father applied to vary an order made May 14, 2002 by Justice M.E. Wright. The order provided for child support payable to the petitioner Mother on behalf of the two youngest children, Michael, born March 15, 1990, and Jessica, born December 30, 1991. The father was to pay support in the amount of $1,486 per month for the s.7 expenses for a period of no more than five months. Although the mother did not bring an application to vary child support upward, the filing of the application was sufficient to re-determine the issue of child support based on current incomes.  The father did not meet the threshold provided for in s. 9.","The parties have two children, a son born March 1990 and a daughter December 1991. A trial on the issues of the son's residence in 2006, the parties' income for the purposes of child support and any s. 7 expenses was held. HELD: 1) From September 2006 to February 2007 the parties shared custody of the son. This is a period of no more than 5 months. Thereafter he resumed living with his grandmother and was supported by his mother. The father does not meet the threshold provided for in s. 9 of the Guidelines.  2) The father's income from employment shows earning of $108,629. The mother's income consisted only of investment income of $1,672.37 and allowance of $2,000. 3) The parties have been divorced since 1998. The son has played baseball since 2004. The daughter has speed skated since 2001. The mother has paid the extraordinary expenses of both children, without reimbursement from the father. It was only in 2006 that the father paid any of the son's expenses. Accordingly, 2006 is not the appropriate year to begin reimbursing the father for expenses he may have paid for him. To do so would be exceedingly unfair to the mother who has borne the expenses of both children on her own for many years.  4) The children's expenses related to fees, registration and equipment for baseball and speed skating are extraordinary expenses within the meaning of s. 7 of the Guidelines. The expenses may be estimated at $2,000 for baseball and $1,000 for speed skating, annually. The orthodontic work, which is estimated at $2,522 should be amortized over two years. The alternative acne treatment, proposed by the mother for the daughter is not an appropriate health related expense in the absence of a medical referral or prescription. The father's proportionate share is 80% and the mother's is 20%. Paid monthly the father's payment is $284. 5) Although the mother did not bring an application to vary child support upward, the filing of the application to vary by the father is sufficient to re-determine the issue of child support based on current incomes. The current support order is based on the father's income of $87,794. His income is considerably higher now. His child support payments are adjusted accordingly."
"FIAT: The respondent applied for an interim order granting sole custody of the parties' two children and child support, including s. 7(a) child care expenses retroactive to the date of separation, October 2005. The petitioner requested joint custody with specified access. The respondent acknowledged an obligation to pay child support and there was an issue as to his income and whether the interim order should be made retroactive. HELD: 1) Retroactive child support was granted. There was nothing in the evidence that rebutted that presumption on an interim basis. The purpose of interim orders is to establish temporary parenting arrangements pending a trial or final resolution of the matter. 2) The company in issue is in its startup phase. There is insufficient evidence to establish what cash is available and whether it could be withdrawn without impeding the financial viability of the company. 3) The current interim order for child support arrears is $8,107 payable on a monthly basis. 4) The petitioner's Line 150 income is $86,870.57. It is common for support provisions to be based on the prior year's earnings. 5) Changes to the child support were discussed between the parties prior to March 2006. A retroactive adjustment of child support to January 1, 2006 is warranted. 6) The Court was not prepared to impose a retroactive order on the petitioner.","FIAT: The respondent applies for an interim order granting her sole custody of the parties' two children and child support retroactive to the date of separation being October 2005. The petitioner seeks joint custody with specified access. The petitioner acknowledges an obligation to pay child support but there is an issue with respect to his income and whether the interim order should be retroactive. The children are ages 3 and 2.HELD: 1) Section 3 of The Children's Law Act 1997 provides for a presumption of joint custody where parents of a child have cohabitated after the birth of the child. That is the situation here. There is nothing in the evidence to rebut that presumption on an interim basis. In making interim orders, the Court tries to disrupt the lives of the children as little as possible. The status quo in this case is represented by the verbal agreement between the parties entered into after their separation. That is the petitioner would have the children every third week during his week off from Saturday to Tuesday. This seems reasonable on an interim basis. This agreement did not address the fact that the petitioner shall be laid off for two months in the spring. It is reasonable that during this period his contact with the children should be increased. The petitioner has not seen the children for 10 months. He will have to be re-introduced to them. A phase in period is required. 2) The petitioner has worked for the same drilling company for about 6 years. His gross income in 2006 was $112,064. This is verified by his year to date income statement from his employer. The petitioner attests that $9,600 of his income is a 'living allowance' paid to cover expenses for his truck, fuel, vehicle maintenance and meals and should be deducted from his Line 150 income to arrive at his current income for child support purposes. This is a matter for the trial judge who will have the benefit of the 2006 tax return and notice of assessment and better evidence of the expenses and their purpose and make any retroactive adjustment deemed necessary. The petitioner's income for child support purposes is $112,064. 3) The claim for retroactive child support is a claim for child support payments which pre-date service of the notice of this application. The petitioner was served with the application in September 2006. The petitioner lived up to the parties' verbal agreement to pay child support of $1,200 per month starting October 2005. He unilaterally stopped paying child support in January 2006. He attests that his reason for doing so was because he was not having access to the children. The obligation to pay child support is not contingent on a payor's ability to see their children.  The respondent's income is substantially less then that of the petitioner's. The child support was necessary to meet the children's basis ongoing needs. The petitioner knew he had an obligation to provide child support and there is no evidence that a retroactive order would cause him undue hardship. There is evidence that a request for change in child support preceded the commencement of this application. A retroactive adjustment of child support to January 2006 is warranted."
"The offender pled guilty at the opening of trial to distributing child pornography contrary to s. 163.1(3) of the Criminal Code. The offender had 1,200 postings on the website, which included 11 stories that were the subject of the charge. The site encouraged stories, and the offender encouraged others to submit stories. HELD: The offender was sentenced to 15 months imprisonment to be followed by a term of probation of 3 years, as well as the addition of an order requiring him to comply with the Sex Offender Information Registration Act, 2004 for a period of 20 years. The terms of the three-year probation order were as follows: 1) Keep the peace; be of good behaviour; 2) Appear before the court when required to do so by the court; Report to supervisor within two working days from the date of release from jail and thereafter continue to report as directed by the supervisor. 2) Denunciation and deterrence are the dominant principles of sentencing and the Crown submitted the offender did not know such stories were unlawful in Canada. The offences were committed against an eight year old and the child was in the wrong group; 3) Permitting the offender to participate in psychotherapy and one-to-one counselling through mental health services is a reasonable term of any probation order.","Accused pleaded guilty at opening of trial to one count of distributing child pornography in the form of written works. The accused was active on a pedophile website and posted 11 stories describing sexual activity between men and infants and pre-teen girls. HELD: Accused received 15 months imprisonment followed by 3 years of probation with addition orders including providing DNA samples and being added to the Sex Offender Registry. The Court accepted that the internet has led to the accelerated proliferation of child pornography, making it an increasing social problem. The social harm of such material is borne almost exclusively by infants and children, the most defenceless members of society. For this reason, denunciation and deterrence are the dominant sentencing principles. The defence submitted that the writings do not actually harm children in their making and, therefore, should not be subject to the same denunciation as pornographic images. The Court rejected this argument because it cannot be assumed that the writings do not stimulate the demand for images and since not all pedophiles are voyeurs only some will act on their desires and anything that stimulates this desire places children at risk in the real world. Aggravating factors in this case were 1) the fact that the accused extolled pedophilia and wrote hard core child pornography and encouraged others to the same. 2) The accused was a high profile contributor to the web site and he remains unrepentant Ã» he does not believe there is anything wrong with writing these stories and only stopped because the law requires it. A conditional sentence would not represent sufficient denunciation or deterrence. Mitigating factors in this case included a lack of criminal record, the guilty plea and the fact that the accused is looking after his elderly mother."
"The respondent pled guilty to manslaughter arising out of the fatal injuries she inflicted on her seven-month-old daughter. The sentencing judge awarded her 26 months credit for 13 months in pre-trial custody and then imposed a sentence of 2 years less 1 day to be followed by 2 years probation. The Crown sought leave to appeal the sentence imposed as demonstrably unfit. HELD: The appeal should be allowed on the basis of this ground. 1) The essential facts are not in dispute. The respondent was a heavy cocaine user and had a troubled history of abuse, domestic abuse and sexual abuse. The parties agreed upon the range of sentences in manslaughter cases and the only cases referred to the sentencing judge were Hathway, supra, and Schoenthal. These cases showed that the respondent had compelling personal circumstances but failed to take into account the factors that led her to commit the offence. 2) The respondent's dysfunctional upbringing or dysfunctional life was put forth by the Crown as an aggravating factor. The judge was clearly alive to the seriousness of the offence and it was pertinent that more detailed analysis along the lines suggested in R. v. Hathway had been given in order to enhance meaningful appellate review.","The respondent pled guilty to a charge of manslaughter arising out of fatal injuries she inflicted on her 7 month old daughter. The sentencing judge awarded the respondent 26 months credit for 13 months in pre-trial custody and then imposed a sentence of 2 years less 1 day to be followed by 2 years probation. The Crown seeks leave to appeal the sentence imposed as demonstrably unfit. HELD: Appeal allowed. 1) Taking into account the mitigating factors and in particular the respondent's post-sentence rehabilitative potential and the absence of evidence of prior acts of violence, a sentence slightly below the range as the one imposed in R. v. Bighead, 2003 SKCA 44 leads the Court to conclude a sentence of 6 years is appropriate, with 26 months credit for remand as imposed below.  2) The sentencing judge was directed to a very narrow range of authorities. In these circumstances this Court cannot find that the judge failed to give proper weight to the gravity of the offence and the degree of the respondent's responsibility. It would be helpful if a more detailed analysis along the lines suggested in R. v. Laberge (1995), 165 A.R. 375 had been given in order to enhance meaningful appellate review. However, this Court is not satisfied the judge failed to properly consider this factor. The Court is satisfied that the limited framework presented by counsel led the judge to err by failing to observe the need for parity in sentence and as a result, the sentence imposed was not similar to sentences imposed on other offenders for similar offences committed in similar circumstances."
"The defendants sought an order confirming their ability to pay certain amounts for billed and unbilled time without violating the terms of two execution orders previously issued against them, as Hfx No. 190408 against the judgment debtors to the plaintiff and the defendants, who were successful litigants in this action. HELD: The defendants were ordered to pay the retainers and legal fees referred to in the decision. The court was unable to grant the order that accompanied the notice in the matter of costs.","The judge declared the defendants could pay legal fees from third party loans without offending two prior execution orders that prevented them from disposing of any property. The declaration was explicitly made on the assumption that the loans would not be secured against the defendants' existing assets. Later, the defendants' counsel wrote to the court essentially indicating he could not confirm the loans would not be secured against any assets. The court issued this supplemental decision. In the absence of any evidence the loans will not be secured against assets already subject to the execution order, or will not otherwise reduce those assets, the order and declaration sought can no longer be granted."
"In October 2014, Turcotte J. ordered the defendant to pay retroactive child support to his former wife in the amount of $21,645. The parties agreed in May 2011 to vary the 2011 Variation Order to reflect the amount payable pursuant to the Federal Child Support Guidelines. In December 2011, the defendant abandoned his request to change the primary residence of his ex-wife to that of his current one. He applied to the Court of Queen's Bench for an order varying the 2006 Consent Child Support Order to include the change in custody of his two children. The Court found in December 2011 that the defendant had exceeded his means in paying the child support he was owed for the period from January 2009 to August 2012 inclusive. In May 2011, a variation order was issued which reduced the defendant’s monthly child support payment to $950 from $1,000 per month. The defendant filed an application for variation of the variation order in which he alleged that he had been required to pay $2,000 less per month in the previous variation order and that he should not have instructed his solicitor to consent to it. The applicant argued that the trial judge erred by misapprehending facts when he found the defendant did not advise him of changes to his circumstances and by failing to find unreasonable delay. HELD: The appeal was dismissed. 1)Saskatchewan courts draw a clear distinction between interim orders, which can be varied on an interim basis as a matter of jurisdiction, and final orders. 2)Canadian courts have not followed Frey. In his decision regarding the 2006 consent order, he held that there was no expressly legislated power to vary an interim order on an application pursuant to s.17 of the Divorce Act. In this case, the court referred to the decision in Frey Frey (1987), 1987 CanLII 4734 (SK CA), RFL (3d) 154 (Sask.) at para 12. The court reviewed the various orders of the Court in the past 10 years and found that: 1)The Court found that the parties had not reached an agreement on the extent to which the defendant was entitled to vary his consent order in accordance with the Guidelines; 2)There was no evidence that either party was aware of the material changes to their circumstances; 3)The defendant failed to inform the plaintiff of the 2009 material changes or to have adjusted his child support accordingly. 4)The court found that a consent order can only be varied if it is necessary to change circumstances. 5)A spousal","Family – Child Support – Arrears – Appeal The appellant appealed from the decision of a Queen’s Bench judge ordering him to pay retroactive child support to the respondent in the amount of $21,645. The order indicated that the period in question would include support from January 2009 to August 2012 (see: 2014 SKQB 334). An original support order was issued by consent in 2006. It required that the appellant pay the respondent $1,220 per month in child support and that the parties would exchange their financial information yearly in order to adjust the amount of child support payable. In 2008, the appellant applied to vary the order because he had lost his position and his income was reduced to $1,500 per month. In his affidavit, he swore that his annual income would be $18,000. The application was allowed and the amount of support reduced to $769 per month based upon the judge setting the appellant’s income at $55,000 and directing him to provide his financial information to the respondent each year. One month later in 2009, the appellant regained his former employment position and began earning as much as he had in 2008 but he continued to pay $769 per month without informing the respondent of the change in his circumstances. In February 2011, the respondent served a notice to disclose. The parties met and made an oral agreement that the appellant would pay $950 per month based upon the appellant’s claim that he was still financially strapped and the respondent acquiesced because she was unwilling to engage in further court battles with him. The appellant’s lawyer provided the respondent’s lawyer with financial information that showed that the former was earning a substantially higher income. The respondent also indicated to the appellant that she would forgo about $7,200 in arrears. The terms of the agreement were submitted to the court, without the financial information or the respondent’s forbearance to sue, and a variation order was issued based upon them. In July 2012, the respondent applied to vary the 2008 order and the 2011 variation order claiming arrears from January 2009. Eventually the issue of retroactive child support went to trial. The trial judge found that the appellant had not given the respondent financial information as was required and his failure to inform her of the material change in his circumstances in 2009 constituted blameworthy conduct. The appellant’s income for the years 2009 through 2012 was assessed by the court and the amount of arrears established. The appellant argued that: 1) the trial judge did not have the jurisdiction to vary the 2011 variation order. He maintained that the 2011 order was final and could not be varied on an interim basis; 2) it was necessary to find a material change in circumstances before it could be varied; 3) the respondent had been advised of the change in circumstances; and 4) the trial judge had erred in failing to find unreasonable delay on the part of the respondent.  HELD: The appeal was dismissed. The court held with respect to each issue that: 1) a court can vary an interim or a final order on an interim basis for child support under the authority of ss. 15 and 17 of the Divorce Act. Although it might be necessary in some cases to determine whether an order is final or interim, it was not necessary to do so here because the nature of the terms of the orders in question and the circumstances surrounding the granting of the 2011 variation order. The trial judge had not erred in concluding that he had authority to vary it and to order the appellant to pay arrears before the agreement and compelling him to pay the Guideline amount for the period following it; 2) the terms of the 2011 order left it to a future court to finalize the amount of child support based upon the appellant’s income. Therefore the court retained the power to vary or rescind the order without searching for a change in circumstances; 3) the trial judge’s findings of fact on this point were supported by the evidence; and 4) the trial judge found that the respondent had not received disclosure and thus there had been no unreasonable delay."
"The plaintiffs claim against the defendant for damages from a fire in their garage which they allege was caused by combustion of vapours from gasoline leakage from the fuel tube of a new truck they purchased from Ford. The action against Country Plaza was discontinued. The plaintiffs claim damages for an electric static discharge through the U-shaped fuel tube in the truck. HELD: 1)The Court accepted the expert testimony of the plaintiffs and their expert witness in preference to the defendant. 2)The plaintiffs were correctly identified as the source of the fire. 3)Although the plaintiffs' theory as to how the fire started was based on faulty wiring, the Court was satisfied that the plaintiffs had proven beyond a balance of probabilities that the fire was caused in any event by an electric current current in the fuel system. 4)The defendants were awarded the sum of $50,000 as damages for failure to obtain a copy of the recall notice or the amended notice. 5)The plaintiff was awarded the balance of his or her income from selling the truck and the $10,000 from the sale of the rest of the truck as well as general damages in the amount of $20,000. 6)Costs in the form of general damages and pre-judgment interest were not awarded.","The Plaintiff's 1989 Ford F150 1/2 ton truck caught fire and burned in his garage. This model of truck was subject to a recall by Ford to correct a fuel line defect. The Plaintiff called several expert witnesses who testified that, in their opinion, the leaking fuel line was the cause of the fire. Ford called one witness who was the designer of of the truck's fuel system and a Ford employee. He testified that the defective fuel line could not have leaked sufficient fuel to cause the fire. He also admitted, however, that his prior written report contained errors. Rebuttal evidence called by the Plaintiff indicated that the check valve in the fuel pump designed to prevent siphoning from the fuel tank in the event of a leaking fuel line did not operate as the Ford witness had testified. HELD: Judgment for the Plaintiff. The Plaintiff had proved on a balance of probabilities that the leaking fuel line was the cause of the fire. The Plaintiff's experts' evidence was accepted over that of the Ford expert. No independent experts had been called by Ford."
"The appellant contended the trial judge erred in law by applying the doctrine of recent possession mainly because there was no evidence that he was in recent possession of the stolen Chevrolet Blazer. Dismissing the appeal, that although the evidence was circumstantial, the facts he found to be proved led to no other reasonable inference than the guilt of the appellant. The appellant ran from the vehicle and made the tracks in the snow which were followed by the police. He said the imprint found in the tracks was consistent with his findings of fact. The appeal was dismissed.","This was an appeal from the conviction of the appellant that he broke and entered a used car dealership and stole a vehicle, contrary to s. 348(1)(b) of the Criminal Code. The theft was reported to police by a passing motorist who saw the vehicle being driven off the car lot early in the morning. The vehicle was spotted on the highway, and when stopped, was exited by two individuals. Two officers followed tracks through a wooded area, and noted that in two areas the tracks broke through ice on a brook. Shortly thereafter the appellant came out of the woods on a nearby road; his lower body was wet and chunks of ice and snow clung to his clothing. The imprint of his footwear resembled that of the tracks in the snow. The appellant was convicted, based on the doctrine of recent possession. He argued there was no evidence he was in recent possession of the stolen vehicle. Dismissing the appeal, that there was sufficient evidence to support the findings of fact made by the trial judge. The judgment of the trial judge was consistent with R. v. Kowlyk (1988), 43 C.C.C. (3d) 1 (S.C.C.)."
"The respondent SGI terminated the plaintiff's income replacement benefits pursuant to s.185 of the Act. The plaintiff argued that SGI had prior knowledge that he was a victim of a motor vehicle accident and that his benefits were terminated because he was not able to perform some but not all of his farm duties. HELD: SGI's termination of benefits was appropriate and the plaintiff was entitled to his solicitor and client costs respecting services rendered and disbursements incurred from the date of filing his notice of motion to the date this judgment is received.  1)SGI's failure to make a suitable rehabilitation program available to the plaintiff prior to and after the accident resulted in his suffering of soft tissue injuries to his cervical spine and resulting conduct on October 1 and thereafter.  2)The plaintiff's benefits under the Personal Injury Protection Plan were terminated as a result of the accident. 3)Sawkiw's benefits were to be re- terminated. SGI was not prepared to find that the plaintiff caused his early discharge from the Yorkton Physiotherapy Secondary Treatment Centre or failed, without valid reason, to attend his scheduled assessment at Wascana. 4)If the plaintiff is found to have a relapse under s.142(1)(a), the court found that under the terms of this judgment, SGI expected the plaintiff to participate in daily physiotherapy in Yorkton if he was receiving a full, rather than partial income replacement benefit. 5)Swingkiw was to be entitled to interest on such an amount as should have been paid.","An application pursuant to s197 of the Automobile Accident Insurance Act for an order setting aside SGI's termination of the applicant's income replacement benefits. The applicant suffered soft tissue injuries to his cervical spine when his vehicle was struck from behind by an uninsured driver. He received a partial income replacement benefit from SGI on the basis he was not able to perform some but not all of his farm duties. HELD: 1)SGI was not entitled to terminate Sawkiw's benefits pursuant to s185(d), (e), (f) or (g). SGI's failure to make a suitable rehabilitation program available to Sawkiw prior to October 1/97 and its failure to reassess his level of income replacement benefits as at September 14 where significant factors contributing to his desperate circumstances. SGI was requiring Sawkiw to attend daily physiotherapy of 3 to 4 hours duration with approximately 2-1/2 hours of additional travel time. It is common knowledge that pain can be exhausting; that daily physiotherapy can be exhausting; that daily travel of 2-1/2 hours can be exhausting; that the physical demands of farming can be exhausting; and, that the mental demands of managing a farm and coordinating and organizing the work of others on a farm can be exhausting. It was far from clear how SGI expected Sawkiw to devote approximately 6 to7 hours per day to his treatment program and still have the mental and physical reserves to devote any time or energy to his farming oprations. He could only reasonably be expected to participate in daily physiotherapy if he was receiving a full, rather than a partial income replacement benefit. 2)The benefits were properly terminated pursuant to s129(1)(e) the first day of his full time employment in Alberta. However, from September 14/97 to the date of termination Sawkiw was entitled to be paid full income replacement benefit without adjustment for a partial return to work. Sawkiw was entitled to the difference and interest from the date such additional benefits should have been paid until the date of this judgment. 3)SGI was to arrange for an assessment by the rehabilitation centre forthwith. If it is found that as a result of the accident Sawkiw is not able to hold the employment he held at the time of the accident, SGI is encouraged to consider his condition as a relapse under s142(1)(a). Under the terms of this judgment the final income replacement benefit will be other than one made pursuant to s139 or 140. 4)Sawkiw was entitled to his solicitor and client costs respecting services rendered and disbursements incurred from the date of filing his notice of motion to the date this judgment is received. He was also entitled to his costs associated with preparing and filing his notice of motion set at $600 being the maximum amount payable under the Personal Injury Benefits Regulations."
"The plaintiff was a member of the Canadian Armed Forces. She was voluntarily released from the military and did not make an application for a pension. In October 1996, DND, without the plaintiff's involvement, re-assessed her release from the Military and ruled that she should have been released on medical grounds, being disabled and not being able to perform the duties of her trade or employment, and that she was now entitled to a pension under s. 29 of the National Defence Act. The Crown brought an application to strike the statement of claim on the basis it disclosed no reasonable cause of action. The defence of the Crown's defence that the plaintiff was barred from bringing this proceeding was pressed pursuant to s. 111. The limitation period for appealing the decision had expired under the Pension Act and the action was allowed to proceed. The plaintiff's remedies were in the exclusive jurisdiction of the Federal Court and this court would not have jurisdiction as a result of s. 18 of the Act.","After being sexually assaulted, applicant was voluntarily released from Canadian Armed Forces. She applied for and was denied a pension. Civil proceedings were commenced and the Crown defended on the basis that before initiating civil proceedings, applicant was obliged to appeal denial of pension or seek review by Minister of pension rejection. Applicant applied to strike out that portion of defence application allowed. The applicant applied for and was denied a pension. Therefore no pension was at this time payable to her. A review by the Minister would require new information and the appeal period had expired. The applicant should not be denied her right to proceed against the Crown in such circumstances."
"The two contracts that play in this case are the contract between the City of Regina and Triple P Holdings operated by the defendants and the same two defendants. While the plaintiffs were not actual parties to the contract with the City, the general thrust of all of the evidence was that certain benefits were intended to pass through the general contract to the members of the Independent Truckers Association. The factual evidence was in conflict but found that the defendants made some effort to include the plaintiffs in the rotation. Problematically, for the plaintiffs, there is no contractual obligation in the agreement of January 21, 1997 which requires the defendants to adhere to any particular arrangement on the rotation of work. The contract goes on to specify the contractors obligations to pay in the event services are provided by the trucking association. HELD: Each case was dismissed.  1)The plaintiffs have constructed their cases in reliance upon the overall affect of both contracts with specific emphasis on the contract of January 1997. The plaintiffs have failed to make out a case that the contract term was as alleged on that breach and that any breach occurred. Even if the case on entitlement had been made out, the damages could not have been properly determined without further evidence or representation. 2)Each case is dismissed.","This judgment applies to both QBG No. 1040/98 and QBG No. 1041/98 respecting the contract between the city and Triple P Holdings and the January 21, 1997 contract between the plaintiffs and the defendants. The first breach of contract concerned a failure to apply the rotation of truckers described in the arrangement between the city and Truckers Association. The second breach alleged the defendants took too many hours on the total contract. Both matters were tried together. The defendants pleaded there was no privity of contract between the city and plaintiffs, therefore the plaintiffs could not enforce terms agreed to by the city and Triple P. HELD: Both actions were dismissed. 1)The case did not turn on the issue of privity. While the plaintiffs were not actual parties to the contract with the city, certain benefits were intended to pass through the general contract to members of the Truckers Association. 2)There was no contractual obligation in the 1997 agreement which required the defendant to adhere to any particular arrangement on the rotation of work. The contract between the defendants and city was not incorporated by specific or general reference. The first sentence of s.9 of the 1997 tender for rental of truck specifications was more consistent with what was actually done by the defendants than with the interpretation put on it by the plaintiffs. They failed to make out a case that the contract term was as alleged or that any breach occurred.  3)Had a case been made out, further evidence of damages would be required. The damages claimed were excessive and did not properly take into account actual operating expenses, the net affect of mitigating factors, and reliable calculation of the administration of the rotation of work."
"The parties divorced in 1992 and the appellant was ordered to pay $200 monthly support. The parties later entered into a new relationship and he and his common-law spouse had a mentally handicapped child born in 1995. In 1996, he was laid off from his employment and heceased making support payments. In 1997, his common law spouse died suddenly and he remained at home to care for the child. He used his commonlaw spouse's modest insurance proceeds for living expenses and he made no payment towards the accumulated arrears of support. In March 2000, he made an application to vary the support order both by suspending payment until he gained employment and by reducing the arrear. The application was dismissed without reasons. He appealed the resulting order. HELD: The appeal was allowed and the matter was stayed so long as the appellant continued to make the payment of $30 a month to Maintenance Enforcement. When his employment situation is known, he could make an application. There was no order as to costs.","The father was ordered to pay child support of $200 per month in 1992. He was laid off his employment in 1996 and ceased support payments. His common law spouse died suddenly in 1997 and he has remained the sole care and support for their mentally handicapped child. He appealed the dismissal of his application in March 2000 to vary the support order by suspending payment until he gained employment and by reducing arrears. HELD: The appeal was allowed in part. He must obtain employment when his health allows. Arrears were reduced to $5,000 and enforcement was stayed so long as he continues to make monthly payments of $30 to Maintenance Enforcement."
"The parties were at odds over the issue of who was at fault as matter of law for the collision and subsequent damage. The ultimate disagreement was whether the defendant ought to have seen the plaintiff's vehicle in front of him and therefore, stopped his vehicle thus avoiding the collision. The plaintiff's claim was dismissed with costs to the plaintiff and service costs in the proceedings. HELD: 1)This was one of those rare cases where the scales of justice were evenly balanced. The evidence, taken together with the exhibits, did not assist the court in reaching a determination regarding the issues of negligence and legal liability in this case because it was at the end of the day equivocal. It could not support either version of the events put forth by the parties. 2)The plaintiff was not satisfied on a balance of probabilities that his claim had been proven. The physical evidence does not assist as a matter of fact because it could support either versions of events related to the court by the defendant and the plaintiff respectively. However, it does not detract from either version. 3)The court was unable to conclude that one version of facts was correct and the other was incorrect. Each version contains an equally rational explanation for what transpired.",At issue in the negligence suit was whether the defendant ought to have seen the plaintiff's vehicle in front of him and stopped his vehicle to avoid the motor vehicle collision. The only material difference in testimonies was whether there was a half-ton truck in front of the plaintiff's vehicle when the collision occurred. HELD: The plaintiff's claim was not proven on a balance of probabilities. The physical evidence did not assist and the court was unable to conclude that one version was correct and the other incorrect.
"The applicant applies for leave to appeal a decision of the Assessment Appeals Committee of the Saskatchewan Municipal Board on a question of law pursuant to s. 33.1 of The Municipal Board Act. HELD: Leave to appeal is denied. The issue of the sale and the alleged improper onus or standard of proof have been decided by the Court. The issues raised by the applicant relate to abnormal obsolescence for size and the refusal of the Assessor to apply an adjustment to the owner's property. There is no doubt in the present case the first prerequisite is law. The questions as recast them are clearly questions of law. For a question to be sufficiently meritorious to place before the Court either the judge hearing the application for leave must have a doubt, if not serious doubt, about whether the tribunal appealed from correctly decided the question or the question must be of such broad importance that it deserves the attention of and determination by a higher authority irrespective of whether the judge has any doubt about the correctness of the tribunal's resolution.","The applicant applies for leave to appeal a decision of the Assessment Appeals Committee of the Saskatchewan Municipal Board on a question of law pursuant to s. 33.1 of the Municipal Board Act. The issues raised by the applicant relate to abnormal obsolescence for size and the refusal of the Assessor to apply abnormal obsolescence to the owner's property. The issues also relate to 15 other properties and as the issues are the same for each property they were decided by the Assessment Appeals Committee on one appeal. The Assessment Appeals Committee dismissed the appeals, finding the issue not to be a matter of the Assessor's Discretion but a matter of professional interpretation of data. The Committee found the Board of Revision did not err in its decision to dismiss the appeals and found the Board did not err on the issue of abnormal obsolescence for size. HELD: Leave to appeal was granted on two questions of law.  1) Did the Committee err in its interpretation and application of the Saskatchewan Assessment Manual by failing to find that economic obsolescence for size must be categorized on a MAF by MAF basis? 2) Did the Committee err by failing to find the Assessor should have used the comparable unit method to determine whether an adjustment for obsolescence for size should be applied to the applicant's property? 3) On the use of invalid sales leave was denied on the basis the question of the sale is a question of fact and in argument the applicant said for its purposes the impugned sale did not matter. 4) Leave to appeal was denied on the issue of the standard of proof that there was no error demonstrated."
"FIAT. The applicant sought an order pursuant to s. 10 of The Attachment of Debts Act setting aside the plaintiff's pre-judgment garnishee in which $2,291.90 was paid into Court from the defendant's bank account at Biggar and District Credit Union on December 7, 2005. The issue was whether the claim was a liquidated demand within the meaning of s. 3(1) of the Act and if so, whether the affidavit of the plaintiff filed in support of the issuance of both the pre- and garnishees complies with s.3(2). HELD: The application was dismissed with fixed costs.  1)Pre- and/or garnishete summonses are not an extraordinary remedy and failure to strictly comply with the provisions of the act goes to jurisdiction and renders the garnishthee summons nullity. 2)The affidavit material did not meet the required precision the amount of the indebtedness owing on the judgment, the debt or the liquidated offer and the statement of defence and counterclaim filed by the applicant was not considered. 3)There were four purposes of the affidavit filed pursuant to the Act: a prejudgment payment, a debt or liquidation demand, and a garnishhee summons. The affidavit filed in supporting the pre and/o garnishs had no bearing on the amount owing by the defendant.","FIAT: The applicant defendant seeks an order pursuant to s. 10 of The Attachment of Debts Act setting aside the plaintiff's pre-judgment garnishees in which $2,291.90 was paid into court from the defendant's bank account in December 2005. The issue is whether the plaintiff's claim is a liquidated demand within the meaning of s. 3(1) of the Act, and if so, whether the affidavit filed in support of the issuance of both of the pre-judgment garnishees complies with s. 3(2) of the Act. HELD: The plaintiff has not strictly complied with the provisions of s. 3(2) of the Act, and the garnishee summons are a nullity.  1) In an application to set aside a pre-judgment garnishee, the court is not to consider potential defences to the action or the existence of triable issues as grounds for setting aside a garnishee summons. 2) The court examined whether or not the affidavit showed, with the required precision, the amount of the debt or liquidated demand. Although there is reference in the statement of claim to an agreement that interest would be paid at 2.0 % per month, compounded monthly, there is no mention of interest in the Operating Agreement. 3) Of more concern is the four-page invoice attached to the affidavit supposedly attached to confirm the amount of the debt owed by the defendant. The invoice is vague and is of no assistance to the court in clarifying the precise amount of the debt owing. Unlike the information provided in the affidavit of Kuznitsoff v. Hilltop Ford Equipment Sales Ltd. (c.o.b. Hilltop Equipment Sales), wherein the affidavit charted the alleged gross profits by listing the equipment, date of sale, model number, sale price, cost and gross profits on a line by line basis, the contents of the affidavit here is severely deficient in showing with precision the amount of indebtedness owing."
"Electric Limited, one of the appellants, applied for an order permitting the appellant to withdraw his admissions and add a claim for an 'oppression remedy' pursuant to s. 5.03 of the Companies Act and for leave to the appellant, to commence derivative action. The appellant had previously been granted leave to amend his defence to include a claim regarding the retention of an accountant at the Company's expense and requiring disclosure to the accountant. The parties had reached an agreement whereby the appellant would commence derivative actions against the defendant. The defendant subsequently retained new counsel and the parties agreed to an amendment to the defence permitting the application to withdraw the admissions and for an opportunity to purchase the plaintiff. The new counsel sought to amend the defence to add a third defence and asserted that the appellant's rights as a former shareholder were suspended and that he had not been properly represented. The second ground of appeal was that the judge erred in permitting the admissions to include an 'appression remedy'. The appellants had been granted a leave to reapply for the defence in the first place. The court reviewed the various test used in dismissing the application and concluded that the court had not applied a wrong principle or made an unjust order. The judge did not err in applying the less restrictive test approved in Abacus. The only difference was that both the appellant and the defendant had registered as shareholders. The former shareholder's rights were suspended retroactively. The latter had not shown any temporal connection between the appellant’s position and the acts of oppression.","The plaintiff company commenced an action against a former employee/shareholder for breach of fiduciary and employee duty. The shareholder defended and claimed that one of the directors had misappropriated funds from the company. The shareholder later retained a new solicitor, who successfully applied to amend the defence to withdraw certain admissions and amend the counterclaim to add a shareholder oppression remedy and for leave to bring a derivative action. The court found that, in the circumstances, the new counsel's assessment of his client's case was sufficient to allow the admissions in the defence to be withdrawn, the implied undertaking against the collateral use of discovery evidence did not apply because the pleaded material facts were the same facts material to the shareholder oppression action and the applicant bore an ordinary onus to establish the three statutory prerequisites. The court also directed the employee to retain an expert and for the company to pay that expert and make all reasonable disclosure that the expert reasonably required. The plaintiff company appealed. Appeal dismissed; there was evidence before the trial judge on which he could conclude that it was just that the admissions be withdrawn; with respect to the oppression remedies and the employee's status as a complainant, the wording of the earlier consent order could be interpreted as not suspending his rights as a former shareholder; there was a temporal connection between the impugned acts and his ownership of the shares and he had a sufficient interest in the oppression remedies. The terms the judge imposed were within the broad discretion conferred by the Third Schedule of the Companies Act and there was no breach of natural justice by the imposition of them."
"The plaintiff was driving from Halifax to Seabright when a tractor-trailer passed her vehicle. She claimed a piece of metal fell off of his vehicle, fell to the pavement, bounced on to the engine bonnet of her vehicle and hit the windshield of the plaintiff's vehicle. The plaintiff claims damages for injuries to her arms, shoulders and neck. The defendant engaged two experts to examine the piece of wood and reported that it did not come from the tractor trailer. The experts filed by the defendant remained uncontradicted and the plaintiff failed to adduce evidence to support their allegations. The court found that the defendant was not and never had been liable for the accident and that the accident occurred because of his failure to observe the standard of care and because the evidence did not support his allegations of negligence. Further, the plaintiff did not provide any further evidence respecting foreseeability or causation and argued that her discovery evidence was not bare allegation, but a material fact that if accepted at trial would give the plaintiff a real chance of success.","The plaintiff alleged that a small piece of metal seen dangling from beneath the defendant's tractor trailer flew out from under the trailer as it passed the plaintiff's vehicle and hit her engine hood, bounced in the open window and caused her to lose control of her vehicle. She suffered injuries to her hands, arm and shoulder as she brought her vehicle under control. The defendant applied for summary judgment, presenting expert's reports to show that the metal did not come from his vehicle, nor upon inspection was there any location from which it might have dangled. Application for summary judgment granted; the defendant met the threshold test and the plaintiff failed to adduce any evidence beyond a bare allegation that this claim had a chance of success. The plaintiff cannot resist a summary judgment application by simply asserting that there are matters of the plaintiff's credibility that can only be decided by a trial judge."
"The accused was charged with two counts of impaired driving and one count of having consumed alcohol in such a quantity that his blood alcohol content exceeded.08 contrary to s.255(1) and s.253(a) of the Criminal Code and with having consumed food in a manner that was in excess of.08 while operating a motor vehicle. The accused cursed at the police officer and asked to get out of his car. The officer responded by calling an answering service and the accused spoke to his mother. At the scene of the accident, the accused was found alone in the vehicle seated in the driver's seat with his seat belt on. An ambulance attended and police officers arrived within minutes and observed the accused in the car with the vehicle keys in his hand. The police officer made numerous efforts to ensure the accused actually spoke to a lawyer. There was no other evidence that established the accused did not occupy that seat for the purpose of setting the vehicle in motion. The court found that the accused had failed to rebut the presumption of care or control under s.258(1)(a). HELD: The accused was convicted of both charges. 1)The accused had reasonable and probable grounds to believe that he may be incapable of providing a sample of his breath or that it would be impracticable to obtain a sample. All of the requirements of s. 254(3) had been proven beyond a reasonable doubt. The totality of the evidence would lead any reasonable person to that conclusion. The Court found that it was not necessary to exclude the Certificate of Analysis as the accused's s.10(b) right to counsel was denied or infringed in any way. 2)Since the vehicle was inoperable as a result of an accident, with no risk of setting it in motion, the evidence proved it was vehicle as contemplated by the Criminal code for the purposes of care and control. 3)The Court found it was in good standing with respect to the other charges.","The accused is charged with care or control of a motor vehicle while impaired contrary to s. 255(1) and s. 253(a) of the Criminal Code and care or control while over .08 contrary to s. 253(b) of the Code. HELD: There is no remedy of exclusion of the Certificate of Analysis. Accordingly, the accused is guilty of care or control while over .08. The evidence does not prove impairment beyond a reasonable doubt.  1) It is clear from the evidence that the accused's vehicle was inoperable and immovable due to the damage from the accident and its location in the ditch. The defence raised the issue of whether a person can be 'in care or control of a motor vehicle' when there is no risk that the vehicle in question can be put in motion so that it can become dangerous to the public. The Court reviewed the cases. The first person to come upon the accident scene found the accused alone in the vehicle seated in the driver's seat. He saw no visible signs of anyone else at the scene. Upon approaching the vehicle, he observed the accused turn the ignition key to try and start the vehicle. There was no other evidence which established that the 'accused did not occupy that seat for the purpose of setting the vehicle in motion'. The accused has failed to rebut the presumption of care or control under s. 258(1)(a) of the Code and the Court finds that the accused was in 'care or control' of the motor vehicle. 2) Considering the case law and after objectively considering all the indicial of impairment known to the officer, together with the circumstances of the accident itself (which indicate driving error) there can be no doubt the officer had more than reasonable and probable grounds to form the requisite opinion pursuant to s. 254(2) of the Code to make a demand for samples of analysis.  3) The officer was sensitive to the immediate concern of the physical well-being of the accused. Though he may have formed his opinion in the ambulance, he wisely waited until medical personnel had made an initial assessment at the hospital before making any kind of demand. In the circumstances, the Court finds the officer made the demand at the first practical opportunity in relation to the entire investigation. 3) The officer, in coming to his conclusion to make a blood sample demand, considered a number of relevant factors, including time limits to obtain a breath sample, the severity and magnitude of the accident, the potential seriousness of the accused's head and neck injuries, the need for immediate emergency assessment and length of time it would take to treat the accused and keep him under observation. He believed the accused's condition was potentially serious and was completely justified in holding that belief. The evidence has proven the accused required immediate and emergent medical attention which made it obviously impractical to put the accused before a breathalyzer instrument within the time limit fixed by the Code. The officer had reasonable and probable grounds to believe that by reason of his physical condition, the accused may be incapable of providing a sample of his breath, or it would be impracticable to obtain a sample of his breath. All the requirements of s. 254(3) of the Code have been proven beyond a reasonable doubt. 4) The evidence discloses that the police officer made numerous efforts to ensure the accused actually spoke to a lawyer in private. After that, the accused made no further requests whatsoever to further speak to a lawyer. Following the principles set forth by the Saskatchewan Court of Appeal in R. v. Leedahl, 2002 SKCA 5, the evidence clearly establishes the accused was coherent and understood the right to counsel enunciated to him by the police officer. He in fact spoke to a lawyer and made no other requests. Further, there was no suggestion that the accused was incapable of understanding his right to counsel or that he was incapable or prevented from acting on his right. To the contrary, the evidence proves the exact opposite. The Court finds the accused has failed to demonstrate his s. 10(b) right to counsel was denied or infringed in any way."
"The father applied for access to his children at a settlement conference. He was denied access and the children had an argument that resulted in his decision not to drive. The father applied to have the access restricted on his behalf, alleging that the mother had been misleading him and his children. Application dismissed; the evidence showed that the father's medical condition and its effect on his driving was real and not an attack on his independence; the court was not satisfied that his use of marijuana was benign and without potential risk for his children; the father must have renewed his prescription to use marijuana. The court found that concerns relating to the father’s medical condition, his marijuana use and his driving were minor and were not connected to the issues raised by the assessment report; the best interest of the children was not to have restrictions on his access. The evidence showed the father was able to drive safely on routes that permit speeds over 80 km/h if the drive was lengthy.","The mother of two boys, ages 12 and 13, applied to vary access to add a condition that the father only be allowed to drive with the boys in the HRM, on roads with a speed limit of 80km/hr and under. She asked the Court to continue conditions that prevented him from consuming marijuana less than 8 hours before driving, and required him to consider the boys' wishes regarding access and transportation. The father argued that all restrictions relating to the transport of the children should be removed. The father had MS, and a medical marijuana licence. His driving was evaluated yearly, and the report arising from the latest evaluation did not appear to address his marijuana use. An independent assessment of the children's wishes showed they enjoyed time with their father, but worried about his ability to drive under the influence of marijuana. The unrepresented mother sought costs. Conditions continued; variation granted. If he leaves the HRM, the father is to arrange for public or other transportation. Costs awarded to the mother in the amount of $800. In terms of the driving issue, it was not fair to place the entire burden of the transport issue on the children. The Court was not satisfied from the evidence that the father's marijuana use was benign, and there was also a concern about the symptoms of his MS, especially on long trips. While in the HRM, if the boys became concerned about driving with their father, they could take a bus home or call their mother. If outside of the HRM, it would be more difficult for them to get home. In terms of costs issue, the mother was the successful party. Although she was unrepresented, she did have to take considerable time off work. She was also inconvenienced because the father was late in filing documents, despite having been given clear time-lines by the Court."
"The appellant appealed his conviction for sexual assault and using a weapon contrary to s. 271 of the Criminal Code and s. 267(a) of the Code. He was tried by a jury, which convicted him.  He was sentenced to two years in a federal penitentiary plus two years probation. He appeals both his conviction and sentence. HELD: The appeal against conviction is dismissed. 1) When one assesses the case through the lens of the Yebes test of reasonableness, conclude that the verdict is not unreasonable. 2) The appellant's evidence is entirely correct to the circumstances of this case. The trial judge stressed the reasonable doubt standard and he concluded his charge with the direction consistent with R. v. W.(D.).  3) The charge in this case meets the standard of being properly instructed. The fact that the appellant was informed by the Canada Border Services Agency that with a sentence of two years or more, he would have no appeal against an order declaring him inadmissible to Canada. Apparently, if the sentence of 2 years less a day is imposed, the appellant will be guaranteed the opportunity of appearing personally or having legal counsel represent him on his appeal of such an order.","The accused was convicted by a jury of sexual assault and assault with a weapon. He was sentenced to 2 years in a federal penitentiary plus 2 years probation. He appeals both conviction and sentence. The accused and complainant met in a bar for the first time and then went to the accused's apartment. The complainant is a sex trade worker and was of the view that the accused was prepared to pay for sex. The accused stated that he did not know the complainant was a prostitute and thought she had 'picked him up'. Upon arriving at the appellant's home, he refused to pay for sex and the complainant refused consensual sex, at which point the appellant forced himself upon her, forcibly restrained her, removed her clothing and touched her body in a sexual manner, choked her and struck her in the face. As she tried to escape, the appellant struck her three times in the back with a baseball bat. The appellant argues there were two problems with the jury charge: 1) that the trial judge should have addressed the jury further with respect to the various types of inconsistencies and contradictions in the complainant's testimony and explained their significance, and 2) the trial judge should have mentioned a number of additional inconsistencies. HELD: Appeal against conviction dismissed. The issues with the jury charge do not give rise to intervention by this Court. While there is a general obligation on the trial judge to instruct the jury by reviewing the evidence and addressing inconsistencies, how the obligation is fulfilled will vary from case to case. There is no absolute formula automatically giving rise to a new trial. Much depends on the context of the whole trial and such things as the nature of the inconsistency and whether it goes to the essence of an element of the offence. The trial judge's charge was entirely correct in the circumstances of this case. Appeal against sentence is allowed and a sentence of 2 years less 1 day is substituted. The sentence imposed by the trial judge was based on a consensus between the crown and defence counsels. Both were of the view that a sentence in the federal system was more appropriate since it would permit the appellant to access sex offender treatment. After sentencing, the appellant, who is an immigrant, was informed that with a sentence of 2 years, he would have no appeal against an order declaring him inadmissible to Canada. If a sentence of less than 2 years is imposed, he will be guaranteed the opportunity to appear personally or by counsel on his appeal of such an order. The jurisprudence supports the proposition that a sentence's unintended effect on immigration status can be a relevant factor on sentence appeal."
"The two accused were jointly charged with two counts of murder and one count of attempted murder in relation to shootings that occurred in the early morning hours of December 10, 2006. The accused had been acquitted of the first count of murder following a preliminary inquiry and both remained in custody until October 2008 when they were released on judicial interim release under the Adult Bail Supervision Program. In this case, the accused was sentenced to 9 years imprisonment for the second count and a credit for time spent on pre-trial release for 34 months. The sentences were based on the nature and circumstances of the offence and the character of the accused.","The defendant was found guilty of attempted murder after he used a handgun to shoot the complainant outside a bar. He had a previous record for non-violent offences., defendant sentenced to nine-and-a-half years imprisonment; aggravating factors included the defendant's possession and use of a handgun in an area where a number of people were close by and that a bullet had found its way into a nearby residence."
"The appellant appeals his convictions for careless use of a firearm and possession of a weapon for a purpose dangerous to the public. He alleges the trial judge erred in failing to find a breach of the Charter when the police entered the appellant’s condominium and failed to grant remedy as a result; (b) in finding it was unreasonable for the appellant to take a loaded handgun to the door in all the circumstances; and (c) his detention is not necessary in the public interest. Allowing the appeal on the basis that the appellant was a flight risk and that he had not established that he would surrender himself into custody as required by s. 679(3)(b) of the Code and that his proposed release plan was wholly inadequate, the court found.","The defendant, who was found guilty of the careless use of a firearm, possession of a weapon for a purpose dangerous to the public peace and possession of a restricted or prohibited firearm applied for bail pending appeal. He had been found, in his residence, with a firearm licensed in Alberta but not licensed to be brought into this province or possessed here. The defendant had residences in both Alberta and Nova Scotia but his Halifax residence was now up for sale and he travelled extensively around the world for his work. Although he had no criminal record and had been on a recognizance for 16 months prior to sentencing, the Crown argued that he was a flight risk given that his convictions would result in a mandatory three-year prison term and he had only a tenuous connection to the jurisdiction. Application for bail pending appeal granted provided the defendant enter into a recognizance of $25,000 with conditions. The defendant's actions bore no resemblance to the known problem of indiscriminate firearm use locally as he was a middle-aged professional and gun hobbyist and the circumstances that purportedly made him a flight risk had nothing to do with these charges but rather with his professional obligations."
"The appellant appealed his conviction for dangerous driving to the Court of Queen's Bench and, having failed, then appealed to this Court. He was convicted at trial on the basis of the testimony of his estranged wife and their daughter, whose accounts of what occurred were accepted by the trial judge. The trial judge found both to be credible witnesses. He also rejected the appellant's account, finding that he was not a credible witness. The appellant was represented at trial by experienced counsel, but took the appeals himself. He contended that, he was the victim of a miscarriage of justice inasmuch as he has evidence that his estranged Wife, out of a desire for revenge, had lied about what occurred. HELD: The appeal was dismissed. The Court of Appeal is all of the view that there is no tenable basis for allowing his appeal, setting aside his conviction, and ordering a new trial. On the facts as found by trial judge based on the judge's assessments of credibility, the conduct of the accused amounted to dangerous driving within the meaning of the Criminal Code.","The appellant appealed his conviction for dangerous driving and alleged that his estranged wife and daughter lied. The appellant had been represented at trial by experienced counsel but undertook the appeals himself. HELD: Appeal dismissed. The appellant had not followed procedures that must be followed if one intends, on appeal, to challenge the competence of trial counsel or to adduce fresh evidence."
"In 2006, Sturgis Meats entered into a contract with Gardon Securities. That contract covered both the installation of temperature monitoring equipment at the company and the month to month monitoring by the company of the temperature in the freezer and cooler at the business thereafter. The contract also provided that the defendant would not be responsible for any delay or interruption of service due to any acts of god or cause beyond the control of Gardon. Even with this dispute, the monitoring was done by the defendant staff in Yorkton, based on information transmitted by the monitoring equipment over a telephone line from the business. HELD: The action was dismissed. Based on the original contract between the parties and ongoing payments being made in 2010 by the business, it is not possible on the evidence to say with any certainty why Gardon did not receive such an alarm generated by the rising of the freezer temperature at the plaintiff. It is possible that there was a so-called glitch in the company's computer monitoring equipment. There is not in the view of that standard that the reason Gardon failed not receive a freezer temperature alarm from the plaintiff was within their control. The plaintiff was awarded costs of the action.","The plaintiff entered into a contract with the defendant for the installation and monitoring of temperature monitoring equipment for its meat cutting business. The defendant monitored the temperature in the freezer and cooler at the business. The plaintiffs sued because their freezer failed and meat spoiled after a circuit breaker at the business tripped off. The defendant had received no alarm. The plaintiff asserts that the defendant breached the contract by failing to properly monitor the temperature in the freezer. HELD: The contract between the parties was solely for installation and monitoring. The contract did not include any obligation on the defendant to maintain or repair the equipment at the plaintiff's business. The Court was satisfied that the defendant was monitoring the signal from the plaintiff's business on the dates in question and no alarm was received. It is not possible to say with any certainty why the defendant did not receive an alarm, but the Court was not satisfied that the plaintiff was regularly having its monitoring equipment serviced or repaired. The plaintiff has not proven that the defendant breached the contract. The action is dismissed."
"The applicant sought to appeal from a chambers judge's decision not to vacate a certificate of pending litigation registered on behalf of her estranged husband, who was deceased and his estate was represented by his executors. The applicant did not consider whether the order appealed from was interlocutory or final in nature and subsequently filed a notice of appeal seeking leave to appeal. HELD: The application for leave was dismissed.  1)The proposed appeal did not raise a new or controversial or unusual issue of practice, nor does it raise new or uncertain or unsettled point of law. However, the proposed appeal may raise a valid question of law based on the facts of this matter, it does not bear heavily or potentially prejudiced the prospective outcome of the action. 2)It is not pertinent to the proceedings before the Court of Queen's Bench or to the field of practice or the state of the law to warrant determination by a panel of this Court.","Civil Procedure – Appeal – Leave to AppealLand – Certificate of Pending Litigation The appellant sought leave to appeal the chambers decision not to vacate the certificate of pending litigation registered on behalf of her estranged husband, who was deceased. The respondent’s solicitors filed the certificate of pending litigation after his death. The appellant transferred the land subject to the certificate of pending litigation into her name only and entered into an agreement to sell the land, which could not proceed with the certificate of pending litigation. HELD: The appeal was of sufficient merit and it was not prima facie frivolous or vexatious. The appeal, however, was not found to be of sufficient importance to the practice of law or the Court of Queen’s Bench to warrant determination by the Court of Appeal. There was no new, controversial or unusual issue of practice raised by the appeal. The issues were determined to be better left for resolution by the Court of Queen’s Bench after hearing vive voce evidence at trial."
"This was an application under s. 15(1), 24(1) and 52(1)(b) of the Charter of Rights for an order declaring that the mandatory retirement of the applicants by the respondent was invalid and that their action was inconsistent with the rights of the applicant as guaranteed under s15 and s7 of the charter and that they be reinstated as full-time members of the faculty of the respondent immediately and that the respondent pay all compensation due to them as employees since the date of their mandatory retirement plus interest and costs.  This was an attempt to short-circuit the anticipated lengthy process under the Charter.","This was an application under the Charter of Rights and Freedoms for an order declaring that the mandatory retirement of the two appellant university professors was invalid and denied the rights of the appellants as guaranteed under ss. 15(1) and (7) of the Charter, and an order for reinstatement and back pay. Dismissing the application, that (1) pursuant to s. 32 of the Charter, the Charter did not apply to these employees since the university was not a subordinate body of government, and was not being controlled by government, but was an independent institution; the fact that the university's governing statute provided that teaching staff were 'deemed to be persons employed in the public service of the Province' for the purposes of their pension plan did not constitute governmental control such as to warrant the application of the Charter; and (2) the proper forum for this application was the Human Rights Commission. The court also considered the retroactive effect of the Nova Scotia decision in Sniders v. Nova Scotia (Attorney General), which struck down the provision in the Nova Scotia Human Rights Act precluding anyone 65 years or over from making an age discrimination complaint. The court concluded that the Sniders decision did have a retroactive effect to the date when s. 15 of the Charter came into force."
"The respondents were charged with possession for the purposes of trafficking and cultivation of marijuana and were acquitted on the basis of a voir dire held to determine the admissibility of evidence obtained by the police as a result of the seizure of 100 marijuana plants. The voir net was held to find whether the evidence should be excluded pursuant to s. 24(2) of the Charter or ordered by the Court of Appeal. Allowing the appeal and ordering a new trial, that the trial judge erred in concluding that the evidence did not have a reasonable expectation of privacy in the area where the marijuana plants were growing and that the search was unreasonable. The appeal should be allowed and a new Trial ordered.","The respondents were charged with possession for the purposes of trafficking and cultivation of marijuana, contrary to s. 4(2) and 6(2) of the Narcotic Control Act. RCMP had investigated a tip that a large crop of marijuana plants was being grown on a private property located in a clearing off a woods road. They did not have a search warrant to enter the property, and arrested the respondents after observing them care for the plants. At trial, the court held their right to be secure from unreasonable search and seizure had been violated, and acquitted them. The Crown appealed the acquittal. Per Roscoe, J.A., Chipman, J.A. concurring, allowing the appeal and ordering a new trial, that there was no s. 8 breach because the respondents did not have a reasonable expectation of privacy in the field where the marijuana crop was growing. The court reviewed case law regarding 'open fields', and 'uncultivated' lands, and adopted the reasoning in Oliver v. United States, 104 S.Ct.1735(1984) in reaching its conclusion. Per Pugsley, J.A., dissenting, dismissing the appeal, that the respondents had a reasonable expectation of privacy in activities carried on by them on their private property. As there were no exigent circumstances, the search was not reasonable and the evidence should be excluded."
"This was an acrimonious custody dispute between two parties. The father and his wife, both medical professionals, claimed that the mother of the two boys, his ex-wife and child and family counsellor, had wrongfully accused them of physically and sexually abusing them. HELD: 1)The mother's justification plea was withdrawn.  2)The evidence showed that both the mother and the counselling service were under-qualified to assess and counsel the children and that the report was prepared for use in family court custody proceedings. 3)The conduct of the counsellors and the court's consideration of the children's best interests, particularly in view of the fact that they were the only children in the family, was at odds. 4)The court dismissed the application for variation. 5)The information communicated must be reasonably appropriate in the context of the circumstances existing on the occasion when that information was given. 6)The co-defendants were ordered to disgorge the children with the full report. 7)Costs were left to the trial judge.","Allegations by the former wife and a child and family counsellor that the father and his new wife had physically and sexually abused the two children were found by authorities to be baseless. The co-defendants, the mother and counsellor, protested that they were under a duty to report the disclosures of abuse. At issue was whether the publication of four reports was libellous thus causing damage to the plaintiffs' reputations, whether they conspired to libel them in order to obtain custody, and whether the counsellor was incompetent and unqualified to assess and counsel the children and negligent in the preparation of the reports. HELD: Judgment was awarded against the defendants jointly and severally in the amount of $27,000. Aggravated damages of $1,000 was awarded against the mother and $15,000 was awarded against the counsellor and her company.  1)To prove that each defendant published written defamatory statements likely to injure their reputations, three presumptions must be made: the statements were published maliciously (malice in law); the statements were false; and the plaintiffs suffered damages. 2)Every publication of a defamatory statement is a new publication. It is no defence that the mother merely distributed the counsellor's reports. 3)Counsel conceded that the allegations in three of the reports, on their face, were defamatory.  4)The mother enjoyed qualified privilege prima facie because parental duty is so compelling. Two reports containing untrue and degrading allegations were in themselves intrinsic evidence of malice. The long history of the mother's attempts to discredit the plaintiffs was extrinsic evidence of impure motive or malice. The taping of the phone calls was considered to be just another trick to try and advance her cause. 5)The counsellor's reports tendered in court enjoyed absolute privilege but that privilege was lost when she published them to various social workers, the police and the doctors. This is true whether the reports were of an ordinary or expert witness. 6)Both criteria, making a report maliciously and without reasonable grounds, must be satisfied before an action will lie pursuant to s.12 of the Child and Family Services Act. Three reports were slanderous. 7)The conspiracy claim was dismissed. 8)The counsellor had extensive educational background but no clinical training in counselling or interviewing children and 45 sessions were excessive. 9)The counsellor owed a fiduciary duty to the children as their counsellor but owed no corresponding duty to their parents. The negligence claim was dismissed. 10)The long-lasting mental distress of the plaintiffs was clear and they were entitled to aggravated damages. They were not awarded punitive damages as there was no need of further deterrence."
"The applicant sought an order in the nature of prohibition to prevent the respondent hearing officer, in his capacity as Hearing Officer under The Police Act, from proceeding with the hearing into the applicant's conduct pursuant to discipline charges brought against him by the respondent police chief. HELD: 1) The applicant was a member of the Regina Police Service. Pursuant to the Act the applicant was charged with discreditable conduct. He was served with the Notice of Formal Discipline Proceedings in Form under the Act on October 28, 1998. He received no notice of the investigation pursuant to s. 54(1) of the Act. The hearing officer held that the existence of an adequate alternative remedy was held to constitute a bar because judicial review is a discretionary remedy and if an adequate remedy was available, it ought to be accessed.  2) The respondent argued the Court should decline to hear judicial review applications of interim decisions in discipline hearings. The applicant argued the fundamental questions to be resolved on a standard of correctness and that there should be an exercise of the court's extraordinary jurisdiction at this stage to prevent further denial of natural justice. 3) The convenience of the alternative remedy, the nature and extent of the error, and the appellate body (i.e., its investigatory, decision-making and remedial capacities) did not believe the category of factors should be closed as it is for the courts in particular circumstances to isolate and balance the factors which are relevant. 4) There was insufficient evidence to determine the merits of this application. The alternative remedies were not adequate. 5) In light of the inherent unfairness in the process of the commission, an appeal was not an appropriate alternative remedy.  6) There were no special circumstances existing in the scope of the application.","The constable sought a writ of prohibition to prevent the respondent hearing officer from proceeding with the hearing into his conduct pursuant to discipline charges brought against him by the Chief of Police on the grounds there were contraventions of the Act, the Municipal Police Discipline Regulations and the rules of natural justice and the duty of fairness which resulted in the hearing officer having exceeded or lost jurisdiction to proceed with the hearing. He sought a declaration that a member of the police service must be informed of any investigation of his conduct prior to the commencement of the investigation as required by s.54 of the Police Act.; the Act does not permit the amendment in Form A discipline notice since it is a statutory form. The relief sought regarding disclosure had been abandoned by the applicant. The applicant argued that the fundamental questions to be addressed revolved around issues of statutory interpretation that must be resolved on a standard of correctness and the alternative remedies were not adequate. The respondent took the position that this Court should not entertain the application as there is a convenient alternative remedy provided in the Act by way of appeal to the provincial Police Commission; that the Chief was entitled to amend the notice and would be entitled to grant leave if required; the hearing officer erred in holding that s.54(1) of the Act requires notice of an internal investigation to be provided to the subject member. HELD: The application was dismissed. There is an adequate alternative remedy which should be pursued. There were no 'special circumstances' upon which the court should exercise its discretion to determine the merits of the application."
"FIAT. The applicants, charged separately with cultivating marijuana and possession of marihuana, plead not guilty to the charges. As is the practice in this jurisdiction, defence counsel brought a Charter motion in advance of jury selection to set aside two provisions of the authorization: a section 186 CCC 60 day authorization for electronic surveillance and a search warrant authorizing the observance of the applicant's marijuana grow operation; a 9 day video surveillance authorization authorizing the acquisition of up to 2,500 plants and a warrant for search of the residence of the accused authorizing the operation of the marijuana grow site; a search warrants, and a copy of the affidavits obtained at preliminary inquiry. HELD: The authorization for the electronic surveillance was set aside. Leave to cross-examine was granted when the trial judge was satisfied the authorization was necessary to obtain the evidence obtained pursuant to the authorizations and warrant and to direct a stay of proceedings on all charges against both applicants. The granting of leave to cross examine was not the general rule, but rather a preserve of the trial court. The 1993 amendments to s. 187 of the Code were no reason to deprive the trial Judge of the discretionary power to use the authorization. The purpose of the 1993 amendments was to prevent an abuse of what is essentially a ruling on admissibility of evidence. The Crown sought to have the evidence acquired pursuant to both the authorization and warrant excluded from trial and to have a stay imposed on all of the charges against the applicants. This should not be considered a usurpation of the appellate court's decision R. v. West (1998), 12 C.R. (5th) 106. Preliminary Inquiry Evidence: The Crown had the right to use any of the provisions in the authorization in this case, including the authorization for surveillance, to search the premises of the alleged drug dealers. The provisions in this authorization were not only redundant but also violated the provisions of s. 8 of the Charter. The application to set them aside was based on the argument that the authorization could not be set aside on the basis that the electronic authorization was a derivative of the electronic authorize which is alleged to be unlawful. The applicant sought to set the evidence aside on a basis that police officers allowed two news media camera crews onto the premises during the search. The evidence would only become admissible at trial by leave of the preliminary judge. The discretion of the judge should not interfere with on appeal the application to sets aside the authorization, as it was done in this instance. The authorization was not set aside in any event","FIAT. The applicants, charged separately, plead not guilty to cultivation and possession of marijuana and sought to have the evidence obtained pursuant to the authorizations for electronic surveillance and search warrant be excluded from trial and requested a stay of proceedings on all charges.  They argued the search warrant, which resulted in the seizure of 365 marijuana plants, should be set aside on the additional grounds police officers allowed two news media camera crews onto the premises to film during the course of the search thereby rendering the search unreasonable pursuant to s.8 of the Charter. The primary ground was that the police did not try any available investigative procedures before applying for a surveillance authorization. As the matter was not urgent s.186(1)(b) of the Criminal Code was not complied with. The Crown objected to the defences' reliance on portions of the preliminary inquiry. The Crown produced an edited copy of the affidavits in support of the electronic and video surveillance warrants wherein all dates and other information were deleted to protect the identity of a principal source of information. HELD: The application for a stay of proceedings was dismissed. The evidence obtained pursuant to the electronic surveillance and the video surveillance warrant were ruled inadmissible at trial. The search warrant respecting the residence was set aside. The seriousness of the charge combined with the real evidence of the 365 marijuana plants outweighed the breach of the Charter s.8 right to be secure from unreasonable search and seizure. The exclusion of the evidence obtained from the search of the premises would bring the administration of justice into disrepute. 1)The portions of the preliminary inquiry transcript were allowed by way of affidavit subject to the right of the Crown to call amplification evidence.  2)The affidavit in support of the authorizations were considered solely on the basis of the edited copies. 3)The affidavit did disclose a current offence. It was not obvious why the Crown edited out the dates. 4)The 1997 authorization was set aside. The search was unreasonable and in breach of s.8 of the Charter. The s.186(1)(b) pre-conditions for granting an authorization were not met. There was no information contained in the affidavit or the amplification evidence which could support an objective standard that other investigative procedures were unlikely to succeed. The impression given the issuing judge was false and misleading. The fact pattern was the reverse of that in Dosch. The information was limited to the existence of a marijuana grow operation on a rural acreage owned by Derksen with whom Begrand-Fast was alleged to be involved. Neither had a criminal record. The boilerplate paragraphs as to why other investigative procedures were unlikely to succeed had no factual basis.  5)The information submitted to establish reasonable and probable grounds was exclusively information obtained from the electronic surveillance authorization. A good faith argument was not available because the information submitted in support of the warrant was tainted by the conduct utilized to obtain the authorization. The evidence obtained was equally a product of a serious infringement of the applicant's s.8 Charter rights because once the tainted evidence was excised for the affidavit in support there was no evidence supporting the issuance of the warrant. The privacy interest was comparatively high. The nature of the constitutional breach was major. The means of obtaining the authorization was misleading because the reasons offered for not conducting a further investigation lacked a factual basis. 6)The residence search warrant was set aside. The affidavit provided no indication of the source of the informer's knowledge. The issuing justice was therefore unable to assess the reliability or the credibility of the information. The fact the source is credible does not mean the information provided is reliable. 7)The seriousness of the breach was not at the high end of the scale. There was an attempt to comply with the Criminal Code and two of the three requirements were met. While good faith was not found with respect to the information offered in support of the electronic authorization, there was nothing in the information presented with respect to the search warrant that lead to a conclusion of bad faith. On balance the administration of justice would not be brought into disrepute with the admissibility of this evidence.  8)The Criminal Code makes no provision to add the names of civilians to a search warrant. The reasoning in R. v. West applied and the search of the Derksen residence was conducted in an unreasonable manner contrary to s.8 of the Charter. A Collins analysis favoured the inclusion of the evidence including the plants. The police were attentive to privacy issues in supervising and restricting the television cameras. The officer set grounds rules that the residence could not be identified in any broadcast. The drug section was not the initiator of inviting the media along. It was coincidence that the corporal did so on a search where the warrant was subsequently held to be invalid. The two events did not amount to a course of conduct. 9)The improper seizure and retention of personal property of the accused was a collateral matter and did not affect the fairness of the trial."
"The appellant was convicted of an assault contrary to s. 266 of the Criminal Code. His sentence was suspended with a one-year probation order. He appealed the conviction. HELD: Appeal allowed. 1)The trial judge erred in law by making findings of fact based on evidence that did not exist; 2)Although correctly articulating the test in R. v. W. (D.) (1991) 1 S.C.R. 742, the trial judge failed to properly consider the test for a defence of necessity. 3)The court found that there were no photographs to corroborate the testimony of the complainant relating to her injuries. That was immaterial whether there were injuries. The conviction could not be set aside for that error of law alone. 4)It would not be appropriate in the circumstances of this case to substitute an acquittal for the conviction and order a new trial.","The appellant, who received a suspended sentence with a one year probation order, appealed his conviction of assault (Criminal Code s.266) on the grounds the trial judge erred in law in making findings of fact and credibility based on evidence that did not exist (photographs of injuries that were not introduced into evidence at trial); by misapplying the appropriate standard of proof; although correctly articulating the test in R. v. W(D), misapplying that test in determining credibility; by failing to apply the appropriate test for a defence of necessity. The complainant, frightened by the sudden verbal outburst of the appellant, fled into the bush and refused to return because his mood had not changed. The trial judge did not accept the appellant's testimony that he used force only to protect the complainant from natural hazards in that location at night. HELD: The appeal was allowed. The conviction was set aside and a new trial was ordered. 1)Finding that there were photographs to corroborate the testimony of the complainant relating to her injuries was an error of law. No miscarriage of justice resulted from that error, as it was immaterial.  2)The trial judge clearly preferred the testimony of the complainant to that of the appellant but did not state why. It could not be concluded that his belief in the existence of photographs influenced the findings of credibility. Even if it did, there was still ample evidence to support a prima facie case of assault. Again no miscarriage of justice resulted. 3)The trial judge erred in law by failing to properly consider the defence of necessity. The three elements that must be present for a defence of necessity, as determined by the SCC in Latimer, include imminent peril or danger; absence of reasonable alternatives; proportionality between the harm inflicted and the harm avoided. The defence of necessity is considered in cases where there is an air of reality. The only evidence relating to the defence of necessity came from the appellant. It would not be appropriate in the circumstances of this case to substitute an acquittal. Had the trial judge applied the appropriate test, he may have come to a different conclusion."
"Fulltext of judgment follows: [1] There is no basis to interfere with the decision of the trial judge. As his extensive reasons for decision disclose he addressed the matter thoroughly. The trial judge was required to carefully address the competing claims for custody, but mindful of the 'best interests of the child'. Throughout the trial and in his reasons the learned trial judge focussed on this predominant issue. And in our view he addressed it as required by law. [2] We cannot say that the learned judge erred in any material respect when weighing and considering the evidence. The time, energy and expenses incurred in protracted litigation could be put to better use in advancing the welfare of this young child.","Fulltext of judgment follows:[1] We do not need to hear from counsel for the respondent. I mentioned during the opening of this appeal that members of the panel had followed the usual practice of carefully reviewing the trial record and written arguments before this hearing.[2] We are all of the view that there is no basis to interfere with the decision of Mr. Justice Smith. As his extensive reasons for decision disclose he addressed the matter thoroughly. [3] This was a difficult case in which the trial judge was required to carefully address the competing claims for custody, but mindful of the 'best interests of the child'. Throughout the trial and in his reasons the learned trial judge focussed on this predominant issue. And in our view he addressed it as required by law. [4] We cannot say that the learned trial judge erred in any material respect when weighing and considering the evidence.

"The accused is charged with driving an automobile with a blood alcohol level exceeding eighty milligrams of alcohol in 100 millilitres of blood. The police observed the accused blowing into something that she described as an 'intoxilyzer' at the detachment. The Crown filed a certificate of analysis pursuant to s258(1)(g) for the intended purpose of proving the accused's blood alcohol levels. It indicates that the samples were taken at 2:40 and 3:01, with results of 120 and 110 milligramrams, respectively. There is an initialled change to the expression of the year from 19 to 2003. HELD: The accused's charge is dismissed. 1)It is not a requirement of subparagraph 258(2)(g)(i) to constitute evidence as set out in that subsection. The make and model of the approved instrument has to be set out either in the certificate or be proven by other evidence. 2)There is no evidence of blood alcohol content. 3)The accused's model was not properly designated. 4)There was insufficient evidence to establish her expert qualified technician did not adequately or adequately report the model or the ability to identify the instrument or model of which she was qualified. 5)The certificate may be used to prove facts, not law. The instrument or type of instrument used is matter of fact; whether such an instrument is an approved instrument is a matter of law. While it is probably the same person made the alteration that is not initialled, one cannot adequately be sure of this. `Probably' is rarely, if ever, adequate to meet the burden borne by the Crown in a criminal trial. The use of a certificate is shortcut afforded to the Crown. If it is to be afforded, it must be properly described. 6)There were no other special circumstances to be considered in the case of this accused.","The accused was charged with driving a motor vehicle with a blood alcohol level exceeding .08. The Crown filed a certificate of analysis pursuant to s. 258(1)(g) of the Criminal Code for the purpose of proving the accused's blood alcohol level. The word and symbol 'Breathalyzer' had a line drawn through them and above the same was written 'Intoxilyzer'. There was no symbol with it. In the blank that followed was written '5000C'. This change was not initialed. The issue was whether s. 258(1)(g) of the Code requires that the approved instrument be identified by way of make and model. HELD: The charge was dismissed. The Court found the Crown could not rely on s. 258(1)(g) of the Code and there was no evidence of the accused's blood level. 1) The Court found that in order for a certificate of analysis under s. 258(1)(g) of the Code to constitute evidence as set out in that subsection, the make and model of the approved instrument has to be set out in the certificate or be proven by other evidence.  2) It was not possible to know who made the alteration. The use of a certificate is a shortcut afforded to the Crown. If it is to be employed, it must be employed correctly. In the circumstances, the approved instrument was not adequately identified as to make and model."
"The Crown appealed the acquittals entered by the Provincial Court judge on five charges relating to the possession and storage of prohibited weapons. The Information alleged that police officers who were in attendance at a residence as a result of a fire were advised by firefighters of two sawed off shotguns in the home. The defence argued that the notice of possession had been sent to the prosecutor in May 2003, but the judge had failed to prove that the date of the offence as alleged in the Information. At trial, defence counsel brought a motion for a directed verdict on the basis that there was no evidence of one of the elements of the offense, that the trial judge erred in failing to grant a directed conviction. The Crown appealed, arguing that the judge er erred by granting a motion based on the discrepancy between the date the offences alleged in Information and the evidence presented at trial because the alleged ininformation was not an essential element of the offences. Appeal allowed; the trial court found the errors of law were reversible.","Following the close of the Crown's case on a trial of several weapons related offences, the defence moved for a directed verdict on the basis that there was no evidence that the offences occurred on the date alleged in the Information. The Crown sought to amend the Information to change the date of the offences. Without ruling on the motion to amend, the trial judge granted the motion for a directed verdict. The Crown appealed. Appeal allowed; acquittals set aside; new trial ordered. The directed verdict should not have been granted as, in this case, the date of the offences was not an essential element of the offences. If the directed verdict was not based on the discrepancy with the date, than the appeal would have to be allowed on the basis that the trial judge gave insufficient reasons which prejudiced the Crown's right of appeal."
"The petitioner and the respondent are the parents of the child. The petitioner separated in October 2003. They agreed to an order of joint custody with the child primarily residing with the respondent. The respondent opposes the petitioner's move to Edmonton. The issues on the proposed relocation are: 1) is it in the best interests for the child to relocate from Saskatoon to Edmonton; and 2) is the respondent's primary residence in Edmonton in the appropriate order. HELD: The respondent is to have joint custody of the children with the primary residence to be with the petitioner. Based on the loss of Harley as an active co-parent coupled with Charlene's vague and uncertain plans for the children's care in Edmonton, what is an appropriate access schedule for the respondent to have with Keeler. The Court reviewed the factual background in these decisions and found it was not necessary to deal with this as the petitioner had declined to allow the relocation of the petitioner to Alberta. The court allowed the relocation in part because the respondent would no longer be an access parent.","The parties separated in October 2003. They have a child born May 27, 2002. The parties have agreed to an order of joint custody with the child residing primarily with the petitioner. The petitioner wishes to move from Saskatoon to Edmonton.

"The parties were involved in a rocky common law relationship between 1985 and 1995. The parties lived in Alberta and then Nova Scotia. At the outset of this relationship, the Agency sought to have its involvement terminated, while L.M. sought the continued intervention of the Agency. The Agency consented to its continued involvement with the child, who had now run from her mother's home and stayed with her paternal uncle in [...]. The Agency applied for a supervision order from Nova Scotia which dismissed the children's protection application. The children were placed in the supervised care of T.B.'s common law partner, who was to assume sole responsibility for K.B. and the children, who were to have their adoption rights dismissed as the Agency did not have another placement for the children. During the appeal process, the agency determined that the information concerning B.R.W. was simply not germane to the decision made. HELD: The appeal was dismissed with costs. 1)The children had been in the Agency's custody pursuant to the provisions of the Maintenance and Custody Act. 2)The Agency failed to disclose relevant information to the Agency and to the court. 3)The agency was negligent in failing to inform the court and the court that the children were in need of protection. 4)The Children's Aid Society of Cape Breton-Victoria (the 'Agency') was the sole agency responsible for the care of the children and had acted in good faith by failing to do so. 5)The court found that the Agency had failed to properly inform the children of the nature of the child protection history, particularly in view of the fact that the oldest child had now moved out of the home with her mother and was now living with her father. 6)There was no evidence of physical or sexual abuse by the partner. If the partner was to return to Nova Scotia, it would be pursuant to a courtesy Supervision Order from the Nova Scotia court.","Two teenaged children were placed in the care of the father, who resided in Alberta, under the joint supervision of the Nova Scotia and Alberta agencies. Unknown to the court, the father's common law partner had an extensive child protection history. There were significant problems in the father's home, resulting in the older child removing herself from her father's care and going to live with an adult relative who also had a child protection history and the younger child disappearing for a time until the mother, who lived in Nova Scotia, finally tracked him down. The mother now sought the return of both children. The Nova Scotia agency sought to have its involvement terminated, arguing that both children were now old enough to self-protect. Although the younger child wished to return to the mother, the older child threatened to run away if removed from her current living situation. Children removed from the supervised care of the father and placed in the temporary care of the Nova Scotia agency with access to the mother and services to be provided to the mother and the children; the agency misled both the mother and the court by failing to disclose crucial information about the father's common law partner and the circumstances of the children once they were placed with the father and this failure was both inexplicable and inexcusable; costs are the appropriate remedy against the agency. Although the mother had completed some counseling, there was a substantial risk that both children would suffer physical harm if returned to her care due to her inability to supervise and protect them adequately. The mother continued to require professional intervention."
"The applicants apply for leave to appeal a decision of the Chicoine Court denying them leave to add the Aboriginal Healing Foundation as a defendant and denying the applicants leave to amend the statement of claim by inserting the document entitled 'Addendum to the Original Statement of Claim in Support of the Motion to Amend the above Claim.' HELD: The application to appeal is denied. There will be no order as to costs. 1) In any application to add a party as defendant, the Court must first decide whether there is a prima facie and meritorious claim disclosed in the amending pleading. The onus lies on the plaintiffs to establish on the balance of probabilities that they have a reasonable possibility of establishing a claim against the party they seek to add. They must establish at a minimum the possibility of a cause of action.  2) The Court agrees with the decision in respect to the application in particular that Mr.Chicoine made no error in refusing to allow the application to continue.","The applicants apply for leave to appeal a decision wherein the Court denied the applicants leave to add the Aboriginal Healing Foundation as a defendant and denying the applicants leave to amend the statement of claim by inserting the document entitled 'Addendum to the Original Statement of Claim in Support of the Notice of Motion to Amend the above Claim'.

In any application to add a party as a defendant, the Court must first decide whether there is a prima facie and meritorious claim disclosed in the amending pleading. The onus lies on the plaintiffs to establish on the balance of probabilities that they have a reasonable possibility of establishing a claim against the party they seek to add. They must establish at a minimum the possibility of a cause of action. That does not exist here and leave is denied. Similarly with respect to the application to add the addendum to the statement of claim, there was no error in refusing the application to amend the statement of claim."
"The Crown appealed an order of a Provincial Court Judge declaring that the respondent was unfit to stand trial for offences committed between March 2006 and August 2007. The Crown contended the judge misapprehended the evidence, misstated the evidence and applied the wrong legal test for fitness, applied the incorrect burden of proof and made a finding that was unreasonable and not supported by the evidence. HELD: Appeal allowed. The limited cognitive capacity test (limited cognitive capacity) requires only that an accused be capable of recounting the facts of the alleged crimes and that he must be able to appreciate his own best interest. The 'limited cognitive ability' test strikes an effective balance between the objectives of the fitness rules and the constitutional right of the accused to choose his own defence and to have a trial within a reasonable time. However, adopting a higher threshold for fitness (including 'best interests') derogates from that principle. The respondent had not been convicted in relation to any of the allegations and had not shown that he would always need a protected living environment and sheltered employment.","The Crown appeals an order from Provincial Court declaring that the accused is unfit to stand trial. The accused was charged with 29 offences arising out of failures to comply with multiple bail conditions. He was also charged with two indictable thefts. He is 22 years old and suffers from fetal alcohol spectrum disorder, attention deficit disorder and substance abuse. He was diagnosed as mildly mentally retarded and is considered incapable of handling the responsibilities that would enable him to live independently and will always need a protected living environment and sheltered employment. He was found unfit to stand trial on some previous property offences and is still under the supervision of the Provincial Review Board. The trial judge was satisfied that the accused met the first two criteria for fitness to stand trial Ã» he understood the nature of the charges against him and the possible consequences of being found guilty and he understood the difference between a guilty and not guilty plea. The focus of the decision was whether the accused had the capacity to communicate with counsel. The judge found that the accused would not be able to provide instruction to counsel during the trial process due in part to the fact that he is very distractable and could not sufficiently follow court proceedings to instruct counsel. HELD: Appeal allowed. The verdict of unfit to stand trial is set aside and a new trial ordered. The trial judge applied too stringent a test on concluding that the accused was unfit to stand trial and when the proper test is applied, it is apparent that the accused has the capacity to instruct counsel within the meaning of the Code. The trial judge's concern about the accused's distractable nature does not accord with the limited cognitive capacity test. The Courts have applied a test of 'limited cognitive capacity' for determining fitness. This test requires that, with respect to communicating to counsel, the accused is only required to be capable of recounting the fact of the alleged crimes. Limited cognitive capacity does not require analytic ability or the need for the accused to appreciate his own best interests. The authorities establish a very low threshold for fitness to stand trial in keeping with the policy objectives of the Criminal Code and the right of the accused to make full answer and defence."
"The 37 year old accused pleaded guilty to a charge of sexually touching a person under the age of 14 years, contrary to s. 151(1) of the Criminal Code. He was sentenced to a term of imprisonment of 9 months to be served in a correctional institute. In addition to the s. 490.012 of the Code, the Crown applies for s. 487.051(2) of The Criminal Code prohibiting S.C. from engaging in certain employment involving positions of trust or authority towards persons under the ages of 16 years and prohibiting him from attending certain public places as provided for by s. 161 of the code. This offence occurred in a particular circumstances and there is no indication that the acts of abuse were random nor is there any evidence that compulsive behaviours were involved. HELD: A sentence of nine months to serve in the correctional institute will be followed by a 1 year term of probation containing the standard conditions that the accused keep the peace and be of good behaviour, appear before the court when required to do so by the court, that he will notify the court or a probation officer in advance of any change in name or address and will promptly notify the Court or the probation officer of any changes in employment or occupation. The sentences were to be approximately 10 years less one day.","The accused was found guilty of the following offence: for a sexual purpose touching A. M. a person under the age of fourteen years directly with a part of his body contrary to s. 151(a) of the Criminal Code. After reviewing the circumstances of the offence and the offender, in addition to sentencing principles as set out in the case law and statutes, the Court found that this was not a case where a conditional sentence served in the community is available or appropriate. The Court found the appropriate sentence, given all the circumstances, is a term of 9 months to be served in a correctional institute in Canada, to be followed by a 1 year term of probation containing the standard conditions. HELD: The accused is sentenced to 9 months incarceration. Pursuant to s. 109(1) of the Criminal Code, a firearm order was made for 10 years prohibiting the accused from possessing any type of weapon. The accused shall also supply a sample of his DNA for analysis. There is an order under s. 490.012(1) that the accused comply with the Sexual Offender Information Registration Act. The accused is also prohibited, pursuant to an order under s. 161(1)(a), from attending a public park or swimming area where persons under the age of 14 years are present or can reasonably be expected to be present, day care centre, school ground, playground or community centre for a period of 3 years."
"The plaintiff purchased a home in 1998. She engaged the services of a defendant realtor who had been previously employed by the plaintiff company, 100% Realty. After a lengthy search, the plaintiff purchased the property in 1999. The realtor, who had recently purchased a house, had been found to be prone to cracking, nail pops and sink holes. She claimed aggravated damages against the defendants and punitive damages against them for failing to inform her that the home had been moved over 300 kilometres from its original building site. The offer of recovery for alleged latent defects in the house was rejected by the defendants. The plaintiff sued the defendants seeking recovery of damages for alleged defects in her home. She alleged the defendants, who were the realtor and owners of the previous two defendants, breached the plaintiff's warranty by misrepresenting facts, and by failing to tell her the home was a certified Dementia Disclosure Statement (PCDS) which formed a condition of the contract for sale. HELD: The plaintiff sues the defendants for recovery of costs associated with the alleged latent defect in the home. The Court found that the defendants were liable to the plaintiff in damages both in negligence and as parties to the misrepresentations made by the realtors. The court awarded aggravated damages and general damages against all defendants and aggravated damages in the amount of $10,000 against the second defendant, Jacobucci and Trevi Holdings Ltd.  1) The plaintiff was given a copy of the PCDS. It was not provided to her that she needed to see the home prior to the trial. It is not known if the PCSD was a registered trust or a trust in the first instance. The PCDS was a trust registered with the municipality. 2) The court found that although the plaintiff had valid complaints regarding the quality of the home, the defendants' conduct in the inspection of the property did not constitute breach of the fiduciary duty expected of her. The evidence was that the real estate agent had misrepresented facts to her, negligently and fraudulently, both in information given to her which induced her, in part, to purchase the home and in answers that they gave in a Property Condition Disclosure Statement, which formed part of the agreement. The defendants were not required to obtain a PCDS from the plaintiff. The home was heated by wood, fell below the standard of care required of a realtor representing the purchaser of a residential property. The problems were numerous and included cracking, nails and sink hole in virtually every room of the house. The vapour","The plaintiff bought a house. She used the services of Cecilia Mui, a realtor associated with the defendant 100% Realty Associates Ltd. operating as Re/max Saskatoon. The house was purchased from the defendants Edward and Verl Karpinski. The vendors' realtor was the defendant, Mario Jacobucci, owner of the defendant Trevi Holdings Ltd. The house did not meet the plaintiff's expectations. She now sues the defendants seeking recovery of damages for alleged latent defects. She claims Ms. Mui fell below the standard of care required of a realtor representing a purchaser. She claims Ms. Mui was negligent in misrepresenting certain facts and breached the fiduciary duty expected of her. The plaintiff claims the Karpinskis misrepresented facts to her, negligently and fraudulently. The plaintiff claims that Mr. Jacobucci and his company are liable to her in damages, both in negligence and as parties to the misrepresentations made by the vendors. Special and general damages are claimed as are aggravated damages and punitive damages. The trial took place over 22 days, spanning several years and included testimony from 14 witnesses. Two main issues are raised. The first is the liability of each of the defendants. The second issue is quantum of damages. The credibility of the parties is at the forefront of the determination of the issues. HELD: The vendors are liable to the plaintiff for breach of contract. Each of the defendants is a tortfeasor, each having breached an obligation or duty owed to the plaintiff, whether through negligence or misrepresentation. Their wrongful acts and omissions all contributed to the same damage. In that respect their liability is concurrent. The liability of the vendors and Mr. Jacobucci is joint, and that of Ms. Mui is several. As concurrent torfeasors, the fault for the damage shall be apportioned equally among the four of them.  1) Credibility is not a science, see R. v. Gagnon, 2006 SCC 17. It is not always possible to articulate with precision the complex intermingling of impressions that emerge after watching and listening to witnesses and attempting to reconcile the various versions of events. The principles and tools to be used in assessing credibility are summarized in Novak Estate (Re), 2008 NSSC 283. 2) Certain of the evidence of the Karpinskis and Ms. Mui is so unreliable that the whole of their evidence is cast with doubt. 3) The opinions and conclusions of Mr. Loraas and Mr. Epp are accepted by the court. They are professionals with no interest in the outcome of the action. Their evidence was largely unchallenged. The Court finds that the pine shakes were rotten, sealant had been applied to the shakes on at least two occasions and prior to the plaintiff offering to buy the property, the shakes were not properly installed allowing water to seep into the house, the skylight leaked and caulking had been applied to stop the leaking before the plaintiff offered to buy the house, there was improper and inadequate venting which resulted in moisture damage to the interior of the house and mold in the attic, the moisture damage in the house included damage to drywall and paint blisters. Nail pops throughout the house were largely the result of the house being moved. No inspection was done after the house was moved. 4) The Court finds the Karpinskis did not speak truthfully or completely when they answered the questions in the Property Condition Disclosure Statement (PCDS). The Court does not accept that the vendors were not aware of water and moisture damage arising from the improperly installed shingles, the missing ridge caps, the leaking skylight or the lack of venting. The sealant on the roof was sufficiently old to predate the plaintiff's purchase of the house. The vendors repaired the sink holes and moisture pockets and effectively concealed the problems. It should have been disclosed. Although the vendors denied knowing of the structural damage to their house, they knew the house had been cut in half and moved 300 kilometers and had sustained damage. The structural problems were concealed by the vendors through repairs to the dry wall, reinforcement at stress points, and repainting and patching of wall paper. The fact that the house had been cut in half and moved should have been disclosed on the PCDS. 5) It is not only current defects or ongoing problems that need to be disclosed on a PCDS. A prospective purchaser does not look to the PCDS only to ascertain that the roof is not leaking on the day it was signed, see Kaufmann v. Gibson, [2007] O.J. No. 2711 (Ont. S.C.) (QL). The Karpinskis are liable to the plaintiff for breach of contract for failing to disclose the existence of structural defects, damage due to water and roof leakage. The terms of the PCDS formed part of the agreement between the parties and the deliberate withholding of this information amounted to a false representation as to the condition of the home. With respect to damage arising from these defects, the doctrine of caveat emptor does not apply. 6) The requirements for negligent misrepresentation have been established by the plaintiff. The failure to disclose, or silence as to a known defect, amounts to an act of concealment of a material fact and has the same effect as an express misrepresentation and is sufficient to attract liability, Thomas v. Blackwell, 1999 SKQB 168. 7) The false representations knowingly made by the vendors and their silence as to material facts were fraudulent. 8) Ms. Mui was negligent and her conduct and advice to the plaintiff fell below the standard of care expected of a realtor acting for the purchaser of a rural property in 1999. She did not conduct any preliminary background checks with the Rural Municipality, which would include determining if proper permits had been obtained, prior to the plaintiff's offer to purchase. Ms. Mui did nothing more than merely mention a home inspection to the plaintiff on one occasion. At no time did she recommend a home inspection even after she knew the house had been moved and before the condition regarding a satisfactory PCDS was removed. Another reason to strongly recommend a home inspection would be in circumstances where the realtor knew that a rural municipality did not require building inspections and Ms. Mui knew this to be the case. The plaintiff relied on the representation of Ms. Mui to her detriment. Had Ms. Mui disclosed all material facts to the plaintiff and explained and recommended a home inspection, the Court is satisfied that the outcome for the plaintiff would have been different. Knowing the house had been moved and had not been inspected the plaintiff would have most likely reconsidered her decision to purchase. 9) The Court is satisfied that Mr. Jacabucci is liable to the plaintiff for negligent misrepresentation. He represented that the home was of 'quality construction'. This was incorrect. Mr. Jacobucci was also complicit in, and party to, the negligent misrepresentations made by the vendors in the PCDS. He knew the house had been moved and sustained damage. He also knew the skylight leaked. The plaintiff relied on these misrepresentations and damages resulted.  10) The costs incurred by the plaintiff to repair the house total $17,613. She is awarded $15,000 as compensation for personal time and effort that she expended in repairing the home. There is no evidence that the distress the plaintiff experienced constituted a physical injury, or a recognized psychiatric illness and she cannot be compensated for mental distress, whether under tort or breach of contract. She is awarded $10,000 for aggravated damages. Her claim for punitive damages is dismissed. Her claim for solicitor and client costs is dismissed. Corrigendum received dated December 3, 2009 and added to fulltext."
"The plaintiff, Sierra Forestry, moved for an order terminating an attachment order against it pursuant to Rule 44.10(b) of the Civil Procedure Rules (1972). The plaintiff sought a change of place of the proceeding, from Halifax to Windsor, in the area where the dispute arose. The defendant, Sterling Farm, argued that the attachment order caused Sterling Farm to shut down and that it interfered with the plaintiff's timber harvesting contract so that the contract was stopped. Sterling Farm argued that it had not established the necessary intent under the Rules. HELD: The 2007 attachment order was terminated.  1)The affidavit of February 28, 1991 did not properly incorporate the contents of the statement of claim. The mere allegation of a connection between the individual and corporate defendants is not sufficient reason to dispose of the corporate veil. 2)Sterling Farm did not establish any of the grounds available under the rules governing attachment orders. The plaintiff failed to establish facts, not allegations or suspicions. 3)Costs to the applicant were awarded in any event in the cause.","The corporate defendant moved (under Rule 44.10 of the 2008 Rules) for an order terminating an attachment order made against it, and under Rule 32.02(3) to change the venue from Halifax to Windsor. The latter was not opposed. There was also an issue regarding an affidavit filed by the respondent, which referenced but did not attach the applicant's defence. The respondent argued it was unnecessary to attach a document already filed with the court. Change of venue granted in part: the applications will continue to be heard in Halifax, but the trial will be held in Windsor as requested. Neither party has a connection to Halifax. The respondent operates from Stewiacke and the dispute arose in Hants County. The attachment order is terminated, with costs of $1,000 to the applicant. An attachment order is an intrusive pre-trial remedy and will hinder the corporate applicant's attempts to resume/expand operations. Here there is no conduct to justify maintaining the order. The mere allegation of a connection between the individual and corporate defendants is insufficient to cause the court to pierce the corporate veil. The respondent has failed to establish any of the relevant grounds governing attachment orders. The Rules require facts, not allegations or suspicions. The affidavit in question was flawed. It should have attached the defence in order to properly incorporate the references to it."
"The plaintiff commenced an action against the defendant seeking damages, alleging negligence. After the fire the defendant moved to another location and destroyed the plaintiff's building. After a second fire in May of 2009 the defendant operated out of a leased premises in the plaintiff’s building. The building was damaged by fire in October 2007. The plaintiff commenced a action against them seeking damages in alleging negligence and after the fire, the defendant relocated to another building. In May of 2010 another fire occurred at the defendant’’S location resulting in destruction of that building. As a result the motion was dismissed. The court awards costs to the defendant in the amount of $750. The commonality of a fire in separate buildings 2 years apart does not, by itself, justify disclosure of documents relating to the second fire. The fact that the defendant filed an affidavit supporting the plaintiff showing the operation of his business in the second location did not, in itself, support disclosure of the documents. The defendant argued the documents were relevant to the action. The plaintiffs motion was granted costs in the amounts of $250 to the defendants and disbursements from the court. Motion for Production of relevant documents dismissed; the commonality in a two-year-and-a-half-year span does not justify disclosure. The occurrence of a second, separate building in separate premises two years apart did not justify the disclosure of these documents. A fire in the defendant building 2 years ago did not establish relevance to the issues of negligence raised in the pleadings.","Rule 14.01 – Meaning of “relevant” in Part 5 The plaintiff brought a negligence action against the defendant, stemming from a 2007 fire in premises that the defendant had rented from the plaintiff. The plaintiff sought production of documents related to a 2009 fire at another location rented by the defendant. The defendant resisted on the basis that the documents were not relevant. Held, motion dismissed. Under Rule 14.01, the motions judge must decide relevancy based on the pleadings and evidence produced on the motion as if the matter were raised at trial. The party seeking production must establish relevance. Here, the only evidence was regarding the occurrence of the fires; there was no evidence as to the manner of the defendant's operation of the business in the second location that would establish relevance to the action regarding the first location. The commonality of a fire in separate buildings two years apart does not, by itself, justify disclosure of documents relating to the second fire."
"FIAT: Following the provisions of the Divorce Act for awards of spousal support, the court considers the economic disparity between the respondent and petitioner's incomes that is $79,320.00 versus $56,103.00 for an interim award of non-compensatory spousary spousals. HELD: 1) Following the provision of the divorce act for awards for spousa support, as interpreted by the Supreme Court of Canada in the decision Bracklow v. Brackley, 1999 CanLII 715 (SCC), the court applies the SAGE as a guide only and orders the respondent to pay interim spousousal assistance in the amount of $700.00 per month beginning November 1, 2013 and continuing until October 22, 2013 until further order of the court. The petitioner, having been the successful applicant, shall have her costs fixed at $1,200.00, payable by the respondent, forthwith. 2) Following Lapp v. Lapp, the Court does not grant retroactive spousol support prior to the respondent being put on effective notice that the petitioner was now seeking spousAL support. At the respondent's age and given his state of health, the courts will not compel the respondent by attributing to him an income which is based upon significant overtime income. At his age and Given his state in health, this Court will not require the respondent on more than a 40 hour work week by attributting to him this income which was based upon significantly overtime income.. At the petitioner's age, given his health, these court will not coerce the respondentto work more than 40 hours. This is an income that is based on significant overtime. 3) Following a review of the provisions in the Diva Act for awarding awards of awards of child support, which consider the economic disparities between the petitioner and petitioner’s incomes that are $79/320.40 versus $57,103/56,104.00 and upon which an interim awards of non compensatory and non-Compensatory support is appropriate.","Family Law – Spousal Support – RetroactiveThe petitioner commenced a family law proceeding requesting divorce and equal division of family property in 2010. She did not seek spousal support as part of her original application to the Court. In August of 2013, the petitioner sought to amend her petition to include a claim for spousal support based on the Spousal Support Advisory Guidelines. In January of 2014, the petitioner filed an application for interim spousal support retroactive to the date of separation. HELD: The petitioner was awarded spousal support, but the award was not retroactive to the date of separation. The petitioner was entitled to spousal support from the date that she put the respondent on notice of her application for spousal support. The respondent, at age 61, should not be forced to work overtime in order to meet his spousal support obligations. The Court found there was economic disparity between the income of the petitioner and the income of the respondent and awarded an interim award of non-compensatory spousal support in the amount of $400 per month, retroactive to November 1, 2013, until further order of the Court."
"The applicant applied for an order that the respondents renounce their right to probate the last will and testament of the deceased or, in the alternative, for an ordered that they be terminated as executors of the estate for a time. The respondents had failed to provide an accounting for the estate of the dead. In addition, the applicant had failed, in addition to failing to provide a detailed accounting, to the Court. HELD: The application was adjourned to February 3, 2016 at 9:00 a.m. at the Court House. The notice of adjourned application and all supporting material must be served on all the parties and filed in court three days prior to the adjourned date.","Wills and Estates – Executors – RemovalCivil Procedure – Wills and Estates – Applications – Requirements The applicant applied for an order that the respondents renounce their right to probate the last will of the deceased testator, Anne Reiter, or in the alternative, for an order that they be terminated as executors of her estate. The testator died in January 2015 and application for probate had not yet been made. The deceased’s will had bequeathed all her property to her husband, Michael Reiter, who died in October 2015. The respondents were named executors of his estate. A simultaneous application had been brought by the same applicant to remove the respondents as executors of his estate (see: 2016 SKQB 15). The applicant had failed to serve the respondents with notice of this application or the alternate executor and beneficiaries named in the will. In addition, the applicant had misunderstood that she could rely upon evidence filed in another action that was also before the court in this application. HELD: The application was adjourned. The applicant was instructed to serve notice of the application and the adjournment on the alternate executor and the named beneficiaries. As the applicant had not understood that evidence from another action could not be considered by the court on this application, the applicant was also required to file further affidavit evidence. She was instructed to serve the material on the respondents, the alternate executor and the beneficiaries."
"The plaintiff suffered a posterior dislocation of his right hip, a compound injury involving his right knee with a disruption of the medial collateral ligament and a fracture of the third right metacarpal in the hand. He underwent surgery to repair the damage to his knee and underwent a further three years of intensive medical treatment. He was awarded $41,000.00 in general damages and $21,000 in non-pecuniary damages. The court considered the matter of costs separate and apart from the non-policiary damages and awarded further compensation.","A 19 year old motorcyclist collided with a dump truck and suffered a dislocated hip, knee injuries and a minor hand injury. He was hospitalized for 22 days. Three years after the accident, continued physical activity caused him pain. Further hip surgery, as well as progressive degenerative arthritis, was likely. Awarding the plaintiff $21,000 for future pecuniary loss, that his employment opportunities were less now than before the accident and he was entitled to lump sum compensation. No weight was given to the plaintiffs actuarial report since there was no history of income and no evidence of projected income from the family hotel business in which the plaintiff was expected to continue. Non-pecuniary damages of $41,000 were awarded."
"The appellant and his wife appealed a corollary relief judgment, dividing matrimonial assets and ordering support for the children of the marriage, with respect to their effective commencement date. The husband argued that he should have included in the assets money manager account the money had already been divided equally by the parties. The trial judge observed in his decision that the furniture had already be divided equally. The appellant sought an earlier effective date so he could obtain income tax deductions for monies he paid prior to March 1, 1991 covering largely expenses relating to the matrimonial home in which the wife was living with the children. Dismissing the appeal, that the trial judge did not err in not finding that the spent money should be included in this division.","The trial judge's decision fixing a retroactive effective date for child support was also upheld as there was no error on the part of the trial judge in fixing the date.,the Appeal Division upheld the trial judge's decision which did not include in the division of matrimonial assets a bank account held in the wife's name alone where the uncontradicted evidence of the wife was that the spouses had agreed when the wife went back into the work force that anything she earned would be hers. At the time of this agreement the marriage was already in difficulty."
"This was an appeal from an order setting aside, as premature, an order of the Labour Relations Board directing that a vote be held to determine which of two unions should represent the employees of the applicant. Two health care institutions, one residential lodge and one hospital, each of whose employees were represented by a different union, were to be integrated into one new institution, this Centre. This was undisputed that the long term intent was this integration. The application to the Board by the appellant to determine whether it represented the majority of the employees was made under s. 37 of The Trade Union Act and on an application to quash, the first question to be asked by the reviewing court is whether the interpretation is patently unreasonable. To jump immediately to an analysis in the facts premised on a different interpretation does not serve. This is the first issue which should have been addressed by the chamber judge.","Appeal from an order aside, as premature, an order of the Labour Relations Board directing that a vote be held to determine which of two unions should represent the employees of the Health Centre. Two health care institutions, one a residential and one a hospital, each of whose employees were represented by a different union, were to be integrated into one new institution, this Centre. HELD: It is within the purview of the Board to interpret s.37 and on an application to quash, the first question to be asked by the reviewing court is whether the interpretation is patently unreasonable. To jump immediately to an analysis of the facts premised on a different interpretation does not serve. The interpretation of the board of s.37 was not patently unreasonable. It does not apply to other areas of the law, such as financing, conveyance of property or insurance, where a more precise and predictable delineation may be appropriate. The Board is interpreting s.37 for the purposes of labour law alone. Appeal Allowed."
"The Maintenance Enforcement Office reduced child maintenance from $300 per month to $50 per month for the following reasons: based on the federal guidelines for Saskatchewan, she would be required to pay $142.00 permonth to the father of the children, Cassandra and Anastasia; however, the respondent has unusually high costs forexercising access as she lives in Saskatoon, Saskatchewan and the former husband lives in Calgary, Alberta. In light of that cost, reduce child maintenance to $100 per month, or $50.","Reasons for confirming provisional order. HELD: The provisional order was confirmed but the monthly child maintenance was reduced from $300 per child to $50 as the respondent earned approximately $12,000 per year gross. Based on federal guidelines she would be required to pay $142 for the two children but had unusually high costs for exercising access as the former husband lived in Alberta."
"The appellants appealed a decision granting summary judgment to the respondent, Chrysler, on the basis that it was not vicariously liable for the negligence of the plaintiff. The Chambers judge found that there was no real chance of success on the arguments advanced by the respondent respecting Chrysler's alleged liability by operation of the Motor Vehicle Act. The issue was whether the Chambers judge erred in determining that the action against Chrysler had no reasonable chance of succeed. The issues were whether the law of vicarious liability extended to leasing companies, whether Chrysler was in the business of renting cars, and whether the Law of Conduct was appropriate. HELD: Appeal dismissed. The court found that s. 248 has no application on the facts of this case.  1) The Chambers decision did not err in determining there were no material facts in dispute. The lease agreement did not fall within the type of rental agreement contemplated by s. 62 of the Act. 2) The evidence raised by the parties was that the lease agreement between the appellant and Chrysler had none of the characteristics of a rental agreement as contemplated by the Motor Vehicles Act. 3) The reverse onus provision did not apply.  4) The issue had no application to the appellant. The evidence did not support the conclusion that the leasing agreement had a real chance to succeed.  5) The lease clearly fell into the 'lease with right of purchase' exception to the definition of owner.  6) The appeal turned on the interpretation of two provisions of the Vehicle Act, s. 2(ak) and s.2(ak). The lease contains the characteristics noted in s. 1(ak); it cannot realistically be depicted as a rental contract as defined in s 62. Further support for Bazley was found in s63.","The first defendant was the lessee and driver of a motor vehicle that was involved in a motor vehicle accident with the plaintiff. The second defendant was the lessor of the vehicle. The plaintiff brought an action against both the lessor and lessee, arguing that the second defendant was liable, both as the owner of the vehicle under the Motor Vehicle Act and pursuant to common law vicarious liability, for the lessee's negligence. The second defendant successfully applied for summary judgment, with the court finding that the lessor was not liable under the Motor Vehicle Act as the lease was not a 'rental contract' as defined in s. 62 of the Act and the lessor was not an 'owner' as defined in s. 2(ak) and the current state of the law did not suggest that a claim of vicarious liability had a real chance of success between a lessor and lessee. Both the plaintiff and the first defendant appealed. Appeal dismissed; the reverse onus provision in s. 248 does not apply in this case; the argument that the lease was not a conditional sales agreement but rather a rental agreement had no real chance of success and the fact that a vehicle is subject to a lease does not change the fact that there is no vicarious liability at common law between the owner and the driver of a vehicle."
"The accused, a young person, was arrested after police stopped a car suspected of being involved in a robbery with a firearm at a specific address in Sackville. The car was stopped minutes after the robbery with the person who had pleaded guilty to the robbery and a gun and number of items reported to have been stolen in the robbery. The gun was found under the back seat of the car loaded. The accused was not asked to implicate the accused directly but said that he had been picked up at some building somewhere in Fairview. HELD: The court found that the circumstantial evidence did not support the inference that the accused was either mistaken or not telling the whole truth. The evidence of the accused’s involvement would have to be so strong that it would allow the inference to be made that he was not involved with the robbery at all. It would also be reasonable to infer that the people who got in the car when it was stopped were the same people who had picked up the stolen property.","The female driver, the accused and two other men were in a vehicle that was stopped on suspicion of being involved in a robbery. A gun and many of the stolen items were found in the vehicle and all the occupants were charged with a number of offences, including robbery. The accused denied being in the area where the robbery occurred but alleged that they had stopped and picked up the two other men. While at the police station, he pulled a ring that had been reported stolen out of his pants and placed it on his finger. At his trial, one of the other men testified that he had pled guilty to the robbery; the driver testified that she had driven directly from her home to where the vehicle was stopped by the police, without stopping; and the complainant testified that he had been lured to the driver's house, where he was ambushed by her and three men, robbed and threatened. Although his descriptions matched the two other males in the vehicle, he positively stated that the accused was not the third person. Accused found not guilty on all charges; the Crown had not proven that he was involved in the robbery or that he should have known there was a gun or stolen property in the car. Although the circumstances in which the accused was taken into custody were more than suspicious, the fact that the complainant had clearly seen the robbers but had made a positive non-identification created an inconsistency that raised a reasonable doubt."
"The court refused to issue summonses to the defendant in relation to a number of claims. The defendant had submitted 18 claims for issuing to the court on behalf of the claimants. In the interim, the defendant responded to an Interim Ruling issued by the judge. The judge did not provide a clear understanding of what was going on in the interim Ruling or the principles related to an accounting by way of lawsuit. The plaintiff alleged that under the Small Claims Act the defendant breached his fiduciary obligation and incidental duties to preserve the rights and privileges of the plaintiff and to not engage in illegal, unlawful, coercive or obstructive acts. The issues raised by the claims were important issues to the potential plaintiffs and litigation, in the court's view, must be done in the Court of Queen's Bench, by either issuing a new claim or by enforcement proceedings of the claim.","The plaintiff filed a number of duplicate claims on behalf of a number of individuals. The issue was whether the claims should be issued. HELD: Section 7(1) of The Small Claims Act provides that a Provincial Court Judge acts as a gatekeeper to insure that claims comply with the Act before they are issued. In this role, the Provincial Court judge is exercising a quasi judicial function. Counsel for the plaintiff has clearly indicated that the claim is a test case. The plaintiff seeks declaratory relief. A substantial amount of the claim involves an allegation of breach of contract, but neither the plaintiff nor the proposed defendants were signatories to the contract. Accordingly, they would not be entitled to the benefit of the agreement. As virtually all of the potential issues raised by these claims are declaratory in nature, they are outside the jurisdiction of the Provincial Court. Any litigation over these issues must be done in the Court of Queen's Bench."
"FIAT: The plaintiffs commenced their statement of claim under Part 40 of The Queen's Bench Rules of Saskatchewan on April 27, 2009. Their claim is with respect to construction contract of purchase and sale. The plaintiffs are claiming the return of their deposit of $25,000 and the costs of plans prepared for them at cost of $3,533.25. The defendant corporation filed a statement of defence on September 17, 2009 denying the plaintiffs claim. In February 2012 counsel for the plaintiffs withdrew and Orion Morgan, president of the defendant corporation, asked for an adjournment of the simplified trial which was granted on May 2, 2012. At that time, Orion Morgan advised counsel/the plaintiffs that his corporation had recently been dissolved. Counsel/the defendant corporation then filed a brief of law opposing the Court accepting that affidavit primarily on the basis that it was filed on the eve of trial. HELD: The simplified trial is to continue on September 5, 2012 in compliance with the provisions of the Rules.  1) The Court is aware that there is case law authority that has found contrary interpretation to similar provisions in other provinces. It is also aware that other case law jurisdictions have found similar decisions. 2) The court is not prepared to follow the decisions of other provinces but to follow other case laws that support the interpretation the Court made in this case of s. 219 of The Business Corporations Act. 3) As agreed by both parties, the Court has jurisdiction to hear the simplified trials despite the dissolution of the corporation.  4) The plaintiff corporation has given notice that it wishes to cross-examine the deponents of affidavits filed in each other's case. Orion Morgan shall be produced for the purpose of cross-examination. If the plaintiffs wish to cross‑examine, they will be produced. 5) The defendants are requesting that the affidavit of Marilee Fehr be considered by the Court on its behalf. She should make herself available for cross- examination. If not, the court will disregard the contents of her affidavit.  6) In accordance with the Rules, arrangements are to be made with the Local Registrar.","Under Part 40 of The Queen's Bench Rules (QBR), the plaintiffs commenced an action in 2009 against the defendant for the return of their deposit and the recovery of their costs for plans with respect to a residential construction contract. The defendant denied the claim and affidavits were exchanged before a simplified trial date was set for May 2012. The trial was rescheduled to June when counsel for the defence withdrew. Just before the trial, the president of the defendant corporation requested that he be allowed to represent his corporation pursuant to Rule 10(2) of the QBR and notified the Court and the plaintiffs that his corporation had just been dissolved. This development raised three issues to be decided before the simplified trial could proceed: 1) did the Court have jurisdiction to hear the simplified trial; 2) what is the status of the dissolved corporate defendant?; and 3) what is the appropriate process during the trial? HELD: Regarding the first issue, the Court held that it had jurisdiction pursuant to s. 219(2) of The Business Corporations Act. With respect to the second issue, the Court held that again, pursuant to its interpretation of s. 219 of the Act, that the trial should proceed and that the dissolved corporate defendant be allowed to defend the action on the ground that if liability continues, so should the right to defend the action. As far as the third issue was concerned, the Court held that simplified trial would proceed and that the president of the dissolved corporate defendant would be permitted to represent it. Since the parties had given notice that they wished to cross-examine the deponents of affidavits filed in each other's case, the Court ordered that the deponents be produced for the purpose of cross-examination."
"HELD: The court upheld the sentence of $1,000 with a 40% surcharge for the offence of unlawfully trafficking in forest products. The court found that, after considering all of the evidence, it was not satisfied that during the period in the indictment, the Crown had proven beyond a reasonable doubt the actus reus on Count No.1 of unlawfully harvesting forest products, nor Count 2 of unlawfully possessing forest products contrary to s. 79(1)(f) of the Act. The Crown appealed the sentence imposed on the basis of the illegal sale of 211 cords of firewood consisting of 150 truckloads, 58 truckloads and three cords sold to Clarke. The defendant argued that he harvested the wood from Crown lands and not on Crown lands. The evidence presented by conservation officers was uncontradicted. The defence argued that the defendant sold the wood to an undercover officer for his personal heating and firewood business and that since the trial judge acquitted him of related charges of unlawfully extracting forest products and unlawfully possessing wood, it logically follows that he should not have been convicted of unlawful trafficking in such wood. HELD: 1)The court held that the Crown was not entitled to take this as an admission that the wood he sold was from Crown land and that it was unlawfully trafficked. 2)The defendant was entitled to have his conviction quashed. 3)The Court of Appeal would not interfere with a sentence imposed under s. 822 of the Criminal Code. The standard of review applied by an appellate court hearing summary conviction appeal is a narrow one. An appellate court ought not interfere in the decision of a trial judge in the absence of palpable and overriding error in law. The trial judge is to be given proper deference on matters of credibility since the appellant judge has the opportunity to see and hear witnesses. 4)The sentence imposed was an unreasonably low penalty for an offence the evidence established. The Court of Queen's Bench ordered the execution of the sentence on each count.","The defendant was charged with unlawfully harvesting forest products contrary to s. 79(1)(a) of The Forest Resources Management Act, unlawfully possessing forest products without a licence contrary to s. 79(1)(c) and unlawfully trafficking in forest products contrary to s. 79(1)(f) of the Act. He was acquitted of the first two charges and convicted of the third. He appealed his conviction. He was fined $1,000 with a 40% surcharge. The Crown appealed the sentence. The appellant argued that since he was acquitted of the related charges, it followed that he should not have been convicted of trafficking. The charges had arisen as a result of a lengthy undercover investigation into the activities of the appellant. He was known to be harvesting fire kill in the Nesbitt Forest, which was Crown land. He stored wood on his property and on that of a relative. If the appellant was using it himself, he did not require a permit. The undercover conservation officer purchased fire wood from the appellant, who told the officer that the wood was from Crown land in an answer to officer's question whether it was cut on private land. The appellant did not testify at his trial nor did his relative and so the evidence of the conservation officer was uncontradicted. The evidence presented on his behalf was from individuals who had purchased wood from the defendant. The trial judge held that the charges against the appellant were strict liability offences and once the Crown had demonstrated beyond a reasonable doubt that the prohibited acts had been committed, the appellant had to establish on the balance of probabilities that he had been duly diligent and took all reasonable care to avoid offending. With respect to the first two charges, the trial judge held that he was not satisfied that during the period described in the indictment that the Crown had proven the actus reus of the offences but that it had on the third count, based on the appellant's own words to the officer. The appellant argued on appeal that his words could have been taken to mean that he was describing where he harvested wood for his own use and therefore his statement was not an admission that he sold wood to the officer or anyone else from Crown lands. HELD: The Court held that the trial judge erred in his reasoning and conclusion that appellant was guilty of trafficking because he had not been duly diligent. It is only if the actus reus was proven beyond a reasonable doubt that the considerations of whether due diligence had been proven would arise. The conviction could not be maintained because the qualifying actus reus was not proven. However, the other aspect of the evidence, which was not expressly considered by the trial judge and which would sustain a conviction, was if evidence established trafficking via another modality. Since s. 2(dd) of the Act defines 'traffic' to mean 'to offer for sale, barter, deal, solicit or tradeÃ ' and s. 79(1) states that it is an offence to traffic in forest products from Crown land without a licence, then the offence is complete by offering the product for sale without a licence. The appellant led no evidence to establish he had either the required permit to harvest forest products from Crown lands or a licence or any other form of authorization to deal in forest products. Thus, the evidence established beyond a reasonable doubt that the appellant was guilty of trafficking in forest products contrary to s. 79(1)(f) of the Act. The conviction was upheld. Regarding sentencing, the Court held that it was important to deter other offenders. The trial judge's sentence of a fine equivalent to the levy avoided (the provincial charge per cord of wood) was inappropriately low. The Court set the appropriate fine at $5,000 plus a victim fund surcharge of 40% as required by s. 3 of The Victims of Crime Regulations. If the fine was not paid within 60 days, the appellant would serve a term of imprisonment of 90 days."
"HELD: The court granted the divorce and ordered the child to be registered in the Montessori program. The parties were one year removed from the original decision and the matter would not get to pre-trial. There was no reason for the court to delay the trial. The child was now fully potty trained and would be able to attend school with the respondent. The issues were resolved prior to the matter coming to chambers. The mere passage of time is not sufficient reason to vary an existing order. The statutory requirements pursuant to the Divorce Act for the granting of the divorce are present. The matter will not get past a pre- trial conference for several months to decide whether to proceed with the parenting arrangements. As the child is only five days removed from having given birth, matters involving the children and the petitioner's parenting are very much in flux. The court should carefully review the material to determine whether there exists a compelling reason to change an interim order. This is one of those things that arose during the course of an action and following an interim court order being made. There is more than a minor change in circumstances and the threshold test set forth in Guenther has been met. HELD: 1)The child was to be registraded in a MontessorI program. 2)The petitioner was ordered to have the child in the program by the petitioner. 3)The parties were able to transport him to the program. 4)The court was not required to make any determinations on either the creditability of the parties or on any allegations of misrepresentation having been made. The facts of this matter speak for themselves and allow for decisions to be made on the various issues. 5)The applicant was granted access to the courtroom. 6)The children were to have additional time with the petitioner and to have her accompany him to his appointments and activities. 7)The respondent was to have custody and access. 8)The issues of child and parenting were to be decided on the basis of the evidence before the court. 9)The Court was prepared to impose costs on the application.","Family Law – Custody and Access – Best Interests of ChildFamily Law – Custody and Access – Interim – VariationFamily Law – DivorceFamily Law – Evidence – AffidavitThe parties were in a high-conflict situation and brought five interim applications with various requests. They had three children, the youngest being born five days before a previous application. At the initial application the respondent mother was living in the family home and the petitioner was living at the family cottage and expected to move into the new home when it was ready. The petitioner did move into the home, which was a few blocks from the family home. The youngest child was almost a year old and the petitioner was having increased parenting time with him. The parties agreed to have a custody and access report prepared. The issues were: 1) divorce; 2) registration of the middle child in Montessori school. The respondent opposed the child attending the school because he was not yet potty trained. The petitioner advised that the school was okay with the child not being potty trained; 3) to take the child to a speech therapist. The parties ended up resolving the issue before chambers; 4) varying the existing parenting arrangements.  There was an interim order from January 2015 made shortly after the third child was born. The respondent had since hired a full-time nanny. The respondent did not necessarily oppose the petitioner spending more time with the youngest child, but she wanted to be the one to control the developing of that time. The petitioner wanted the child Wednesday afternoon to evening and Sunday from 11:00 am to 4:00 pm. He also wanted increased time with the two older children so that he could get them to their necessary activities and so that they could continue to develop their bond with him; 5) arrears of child and spousal support; 6) the respondent’s request to return the 2005 vehicle. The vehicle had been at the parties’ farm and was damaged beyond repair without insurance. The petitioner then towed the vehicle to the respondent’s home; 7) objections to one of the petitioner’s affidavits; and 8) costs. HELD: The issues were decided as follows: 1) the divorce was granted because the parties had been separated in excess of a year and no satisfactory reasons were argued for not allowing it; 2) the court held that it would be appropriate for the child to be enrolled in the Montessori school. The cost of the program was ordered to be paid by the petitioner. The parties were to agree on the child’s transportation to the school and if they could not agree the petitioner would transport him; 3) the court kept the issue under its jurisdiction so that either party could bring the matter back upon two days’ notice; 4) the pre-trial conference was months away and the court did not find it appropriate to have the matter of increased parenting time proceed to a pre-trial conference, as a stand-alone issue. The court found that it was in the best interests of all the children to have further time with the petitioner as he requested. The court also dealt with transportation for the hockey and the middle child’s skating; 5) counsel agreed that the issue of arrears due under the support provisions would await further discussion at the pre-trial conference with either party having leave to bring the matter back on two days’ notice; 6) the matter was adjourned sine die on two days’ notice; 7) the complaints were not generally well-founded; and 8) the petitioner was entitled to costs of $1,000 in any event of the cause. The respondent was entitled to costs of $200 in any event of the cause. The court declined to send the matter to the high-conflict mediation program."
"HELD: SaskTel brings an application seeking an order striking the defendant's Statement of Claim under Rule 7-9(1)(a) of the Queen's Bench Rules on the basis that it discloses no reasonable claim and for an order for costs. SaskTel is awarded its costs. The claim against SaskTel has no reasonable prospect of success. The defendant filed a Notice of Intent to Defend on August 13, 2014 along with a Demand for Particulars. The notice of intent to Defence was struck out along with the demand for particulars and the pleading or other document disclosed information. HELD: The claim has no a reasonable prospect for success and should be struck. The pleadings are carefully reviewed. The plaintiff is entitled to plead the facts upon which he relies in making his claim. The Court concludes that the defendant’s claims against Sasktel have no reasonable prospects of success and are awarded costs.",Civil Procedure – Pleadings – Statement of Claim – Application to Strike The defendant applied for an order striking the plaintiff’s statement of claim under Queen’s Bench rule 7-9(1)(a) on the basis that under rule 7-9(2)(a) it disclosed no reasonable cause of action. HELD: The application was granted. The court reviewed the pleadings drafted by the self-represented plaintiff and found his claims had no reasonable prospect of success and struck them.
"The ultimate issue in the insurance premium surpluses was who was entitled to the money. Empire Life Insurance claims no interest in the funds but is concerned that the claim of Ag Credit to these funds is not clear and that the rights to refund of such surplus may belong to individual borrowers of the insurer whose lives were insured over the years under the Policy. Thus it seeks to interplead, pay the monies into court and have the Court give directions as to how the determination of ownership will be made. HELD: 1)The insurer will have the court determine, on this application, that it alone is entitled to payment of the funds in question. The argument that any monies received by Ag Credit are 'public money' within the meaning of the Financial Administration Act, 1993, they are also therefore 'public Money' under Ag Credit's Act and thus Crown property for the present purposes is non-sequitur. 2)The only conclusion drawn was that the insurer had acted in full compliance with its duty of uberrima fides in bringing the potentially valid claims of the insured clients to the attention of the Court and in resisting the claim by Ag credit to pay the full monthly premium surplus of $3,552,881.00 which was paid directly to the insurer from the date of the Policy termination to January 1, 2015 when Ag Credit terminated the policy. 3)The insurance policy and predecessor polices contained provisions for so-called 'Experience Credits'. The insurer claims no entitlement to the surplias. The insurer will be appointing a representative party to advance the case and interests of the class.","Civil Procedure – Queen’s Bench Rules, Rule 6-75 The applicant insurance company sought an order for interpleader pursuant to Queen’s Bench rule 6-75 regarding premium surpluses it held in the amount of $3,550,800 that were generated between 1990, when it issued a group life insurance policy to the respondent, Agricultural Credit Corporation (Ag Credit), and 2015, when Ag Credit terminated the policy. The applicant requested that the monies be paid into court and that directions be provided as to how the determination of ownership would be decided. Ag Credit took the position that the funds paid as premiums were Crown funds and thus any surpluses were the property of the Crown and properly payable to Ag Credit as its agent. It argued that the interpleader order was unnecessary. The purpose of the group life insurance was to ensure that outstanding loans made by Ag Credit to borrowers were paid in the event of the borrowers’ deaths. Individual borrowers paid the premiums applicable to them by paying those amounts to Ag Credit, who remitted the payments to the applicant. There was no clear direction regarding the surpluses in the policy or in the Superintendent of Insurance Guidelines or applicable legislation. HELD: The application was granted subject to the court hearing further submissions from both parties regarding such things as whether the surplus should be paid into court or left to be administered by the applicant during the proceedings. The court found that the insurance company was entitled to some form of interpleader relief and dismissed Ag Credit’s claim to the surplus. It ordered that a representative be appointed to represent the class of insured clients in the proceedings in order to determine who was entitled to the surplus."
"A decree dissolving the marriage at trial and reserved judgment on the issues of maintenance, costs and division of matrimonial property. Although the applicant claimed spousal maintenance in her petition, her counsel indicated she was willing to withdraw her claim if she was awarded an equal share of the property. HELD: 1)The evidence presented by the applicant was uncontested. That evidence discloses no exceptions, exemptions or equitable considerations that would make an equal distribution unfair or inequitable. 2)The lis pendens registered as item 84-S-26535 shall be vacated. 3)The exemption to which the respondent may be entitled was refused.","Division of matrimonial property. Husband owned farm land at the time of the marriage. During the marriage he spent heavily on booze and drugs. Wife spent her savings and employment income on the farming operation and family expenses. Held: Inequitable and unfair to exempt value of farm land from matrimonial assets. Equal division ordered, to be paid in installments secured against the land. Husband ordered to pay maintenance for support of the children."
"The respondent purchased a sailing vessel from Finland in 1988 and sailed to the Carribean in 1989. The vessel was based in Lunenburg, Nova Scotia but was in Halifax at the end of the Marblehead race. In August 1990, an assessment of $195,785.90 was made against the respondent because the vessel was registered in Nova Scotia and had been used in the province. Notice of objection was filed and eventually the matter came before the N.S. Tax Review Board, which concluded in January 1991 that the vessel did not have a sufficient presence in the Province to attract tax under s.7(1) of the Act. Dismissing the appeal, that s.2(4) is a supplementary provision to guard against the methods of avoidance of the purchase tax. It is a provision which, if enacted, might well be construed as infringing upon s. 121 of the Constitution Act, 1867 which provides that 121. All Articles of Growth, Produce, or Manufacture of any one of the Provinces shall be admitted free into each other.","A sailboat, which was owned by a resident in Nova Scotia and registered in the province, but which was purchased in Finland and kept in the United States and the Carribean, and which was twice in Nova Scotia under customs permits to participate in races, did not have a sufficient presence in the province to be subject to an assessment under the Health Services Tax Act."
"FIAT. The first two plaintiffs brought an application seeking an order for production of documents by the defendants. The plaintiffs sought to have the defendants produce an order in respect to the plaintiffs documents and an order that the plaintiffs provide further and betterparticulars. The third plaintiff sought documents relating to the franchise agreement, lease, advertising, signage and the potential for damages arising from an alleged defamation of the defendants and for damages resulting from an allegation of improper charges. The defendants had agreed to produce the documents. HELD: Application dismissed. 1)The documents requested were not privileged and must be produced. 2)The affidavits, tapes, receipts and bank records of the franchisee and related businesses were not relevant. 3)The letter was not privileged. 4)The plaintiff was not prepared to reply to the pleading. 5)The requested documents were not prepared in anticipation of litigation. 6)The affidavit was not filed as it was not clear whether the request pertained to the period when the plaintiffs were operating the franchise or the period prior to that. 7)The return of the documents was not ordered. 8)The defendants were not required to supply the plaintiff with the documents except in the amount of $3,000. 9)The plaintiffs were not entitled to any other lawyer's or company's records. 10)The lawyer's affidavit was filed as well as the other affidavits and viva voce documents. 11)The defendant was not required by law to provide further or betterparticles. 12)The court declined to order production of the original documents. 13)The applicant was entitled to costs of production in any event of the cause.","FIAT The Plaintiffs purchased a Robin's Donuts franchise from the Defendants. They later tried to sell the franchise without success. Eventually they turned the franchise back and sued for damages alleging that the Defendants had interfered in their attempts to sell the franchise and had wrongfully refused to consent to a sale negotiated by the Plaintiffs. The Defendants counterclaimed for unpaid royalties and rent. The parties each prepared and served their Statements as to Documents. Both parties then applied for production of additional documents under Rule 212. The Defendant also sought further particulars of certain matters referred to in the Plaintiff's Defence to Counterclaim under Rule 164. HELD: Applications allowed. Both of the parties were ordered to produce some of the documents requested. 1)A party must disclose all documents which may contain information which either directly or indirectly enables the other party to advance his case or to damage the case of his adversary.  2)The test of relevance on discovery is wider than that of admissibility at trial. 3)Documents brought into existence with the dominant purpose of using them in order to obtain legal advice or to conduct or aid in the conduct of litigation which is in reasonable prospect at the time of their creation are privileged. 4)Particulars are appropriate only (i)to enable a party to properly plead in response or (ii)to eliminate surprise. 5)The Court found that further particulars were appropriate in this case on the second ground, given the vague nature of the impugned paragraph in the Plaintiff's Defence to Counterclaim."
"The respondent owned several buildings converted into apartment units. The proposal to replace these buildings with high density apartments was rejected by Halifax City Council. The Crown appealed, raising two grounds on appeal. 1) that the trial judge erred in law in her interpretation of s. 363 of the Halifax City Charter; and 2) that when the legislators turned their minds to the unsightliness of buildings, they drafted subsection 6.6 which restricted this offence to unsightly caused only by neglect. The trial judge made no error in law.","The respondent landowner haphazardly painted his buildings in order to protest a decision of Halifax city council. The city charged the respondent under the unsightly premises provisions of the Halifax City Charter. At trial, the court held the wording of the City Charter could not support the charge, and that a conviction would violate the respondent's s.2(b) Charter rights to freedom of expression. The city appealed. Dismissing the appeal, that the trial judge did not commit an error in law. S.363(3) of the Halifax City Charter, under which the respondent was charged, refers to land as opposed to buildings, and cannot be interpreted to include the exterior finishes of buildings, a category already dealt with in s.363(6), which covers the unsightliness of buildings caused by neglect, not overt actions."
"This was an action for damages for injuries suffered by the plaintiff as a result of a motor vehicle accident. The plaintiff was stopped on the highway by a flagman to allow a piece of heavy machinery to back out onto the roadway. The defendant admitted liability and liability. The Plaintiff was awarded damages for the injuries suffered. The Court found that the Plaintiff had discharged her burden of establishing on a balance of probabilities that the described pain problems were caused, or contributed, by the defendant's negligence.","The 46-year-old female plaintiff sought damages for injuries suffered as a result of a motor vehicle accident. Her car was stopped by a flagman as a result of highway work when the defendant's vehicle struck her from behind. Awarding $15,000 for the whiplash injury and $75,000 for back injury as general damages. This amount was reduced to $25,000 due to a pre-existing condition. The court was satisfied there were degenerative changes in the plaintiffs spine which were accelerated by the accident. The pain problems were caused or contributed to by the defendant's negligence. An award for lost wages was also reduced by a factor of 33.%."
"FIAT. Acting under the authority of The Victims of Domestic Violence Act, a justice of the peace madean order granting Khamseng Dolgopol exclusive occupation of the family residence and restraining him from having contact with his wife or daughter during thecurrency of the order. HELD: The order was terminated.  1)There was no element of urgency and the application for relief should have awaited the regular Queen's Bench chamber chamber chambers. 2)The evidence at the hearing suggested that there was a problem with the wording of the statute and the procedure for obtaining a rehearing of the matter. 3)The respondent should have been given the opportunity to respond.","The Respondent and the Applicant had a violent argument after which the Applicant and the child left the matrimonial home and moved to Transition House. The Applicant sought and obtained an emergency intervention order under The Victims of Domestic Violence Act from a Justice of the Peace giving her exclusive occupation of the matrimonial home and restraining her husband from having any contact with her or their daughter during the currency of the order. This order was then brought before a Queen's Bench Judge as required by s.5 of the Act for review. The reviewing Judge refused to confirm the order and directed a rehearing as permitted by the section. The matter then came before this Judge for the rehearing ordered. HELD: Order vacated.  1)An emergency intervention order is granted by a Justice of the Peace under s.3 of the Act without notice to the person whose conduct it restrains and without any representations from that person or on that person's behalf. It is an extraordinary remedy to be granted only where serious and urgent circumstances indicate a need for prompt action to protect the victim. 2)Absent such urgency, the application should be one for a 'victim's assistance order' brought to a Queen's Bench Judge in Chambers under s.7 in accordance with The Queen's Bench Rules. 3)In this case the domestic violence complained of occurred on January 28. There was no evidence that on February 1, 1995, Dolgopol was at risk of immediate harm. There was by then no element of urgency and the application for relief should have awaited the regular Queen's Bench Family Law Division chamber sittings.  4)The Court commented that it was unclear whether this rehearing was to proceed de novo or as a review but determined that the order should not stand in any event and therefore terminated it forthwith."
FIAT. The petitioner sought interim custody of his son born in 1996. The Divorce Act requires either spouse to be ordinarily resident in the province for at least 1 year immediately preceding the commencement of the proceeding. The Court had jurisdiction under the DivorceAct but did not have jurisdiction under The Children's Law Act. The father argued that the seven factors listed are conjunctive and the petitioner must satisfy all seven in order for the Court to exercise jurisdiction. HELD: Interim custody was granted to the father. 1)The child had a real and substantial connection with Saskatchewan and it was appropriate for jurisdiction to be exercised in Saskatchewan. The court had jurisdiction pursuant to s15(1)(b) as the child had no connection of a consequence to Alberta. 2)Interim custody would continue to reside with the petitioner's parents in the city of Regina. 3)The father was ordered to not be removed from the city or move from the province without further order from the court.,FIAT. The petitioner sought interim custody of his son. The respondent contested that the petition for divorce was a nullity and Saskatchewan courts did not have jurisdiction to hear the divorce proceedings and lacked jurisdiction or ought to decline to exercise jurisdiction under the Children's Law Act. Both parties made serious allegations against the other and there was substantial conflict in the affidavit evidence. HELD: An order for interim custody was granted on the condition the petitioner continued to reside with his parents in Regina and that the child not be removed from Regina without further court order. 1)The respondent did not acquiesce to the child's residing in Saskatchewan such that it may be said he was habitually resident here for the purposes of the Children's Law Act.  2)The seven factors listed in s15(1)(b) are conjunctive and the petitioner must satisfy them all. With respect to (iii) a petition for divorce was commenced in July 1996. 3)The child had a real and substantial connection with Saskatchewan and it was appropriate to exercise jurisdiction pursuant to s15(1)(b). Jurisdiction existed pursuant to s15(3) as the child had a closer connection to Saskatchewan then to Alberta. Both sets of grandparents and other family members on both sides reside in Saskatchewan. The child had no connection of consequence to the Province of Alberta.
"The applicant was the mother of a child who had been placed in the permanent care of Family and Children's Services of Digby County. She applied under Rule 37.11(2) of the Civil Procedure Rules for an order setting aside the decision of the Chief Judge of the Family Court setting aside permanent care and custody. The applicant had failed to recognize and take control of her alcoholism and had been prevented from attending a hearing scheduled for November 14, 2002. The Respondent had placed the child in the Agency's permanent care. The Applicant withdrew from the proceeding and requested that the Court set aside the permanent custody order and allow her another disposition review hearing. Application granted; matter set aside; the court ordered that the applicant have ten days from the date of her application to appear at the hearing to file a written plan for long term care of the child; the order was set aside and the matter set down for disposition review on a date convenient to counsel.","The mother of a child applied to have the court set aside its decision granting permanent care and custody of the child to the Agency. When the applicant did not appear at the original hearing, her counsel withdrew as solicitor of record. She now argued that she had made a mistake in the hearing date. Application allowed; previous order set aside and matter set down for disposition review hearing. In order to protect the best interests of the child, the court must take jurisdiction and set aside the previous order to allow the applicant another disposition review hearing."
"The defendant made an application for the exclusion of evidence found following a search conducted at his residence pursuant to a warrant issued by fax from the Justice of the Peace Centre in Dartmouth, N.S. The defendant argued that there was sufficient reliable evidence to constitute the reasonable and probable grounds for the issuance of the warrant. HELD: The application was granted and the evidence obtained by it was excluded under s. 24(2) of the Charter of Rights. There were at least three concerns to be addressed in weighing evidence relied on by the police to justify a warrantless search. First, was the information predicting the commission of a criminal offence compelling? Second, where that information was based on a 'tip' originating from outside the police, was that source credible? Finally, the evidence corroborated by police investigation prior to making the decision to conduct the search. The police did not seek a warrant on the basis of this information alone, but conducted surveillance, which corroborated the information provided by their sources.","The defendant applied to have evidence found during a search of his premises excluded on the basis that the search warrant was invalid. Application dismissed; there was sufficient evidence to constitute reasonable and probable grounds for the issuance of the warrant. Overall the nature of the evidence was compelling with four separate and independent sources all confirming either that the defendant was selling drugs or that drugs were being sold at his residence; although individually none of the sources was of known or proven reliability, collectively they reinforced and confirmed each other; and the police conducted surveillance which corroborated the information provided by the sources."
"An appeal by a tenant against a decision awarding his former landlord $1,245.00. The appeal questions the correctness of the award and the validity of the notice of the hearing. HELD: The application is allowed; the award is set aside; and there will be a new hearing on a date to be fixed by the Rentalsman. There will be no costs.","An appeal of an award of $1,245. The tenant's father contacted him about the hearing while he was out of the country. The father appeared at the hearing and objected to service of the hearing notice. HELD: The appeal was allowed. The award was set aside and a new hearing was ordered. The Deputy Rentalsman committed an error in law by denying 10 days notice. The Landlord and Tenant Act s.60(5.1) empowers the Rentalsman to validate a defective service provided the notice came to the attention of the person to be served. The day the notice was received and the day of the hearing must be excluded in calculating the notice period (Interpretation Act s.24(4)). In this case the tenant received only 8 days notice. No costs."
"This was an application for an order extending the time to apply for leave to appeal and for leave/adrenaline and leave to appealed. Sections 13 and 14 of the Companies Creditors Arrangement Act govern the proposed appeal. The applicant took no steps to appeal within the twenty-one day period due to an inadvertence of its lawyer. Although the applicant cannot bring itself within s.14(2), it argues that the court nevertheless has the power to extend the time either under s13 of the Creditor Arrangment Act which empowers the appeal court to grant leave to appeals on such terms as to security and in other respects as the judge or court directs or under s9(6) of the Court of Appeal Act, 2000, S.S. 2000, s9.1, which emulates the Court's power to further appeal.","This was an application for an order extending the time to apply for leave to appeal and for leave to appeal. Sections 13 and 14 of the Companies' Creditors Arrangement Act govern the appeal. The applicant took no steps to appeal within the 21 day period due to an inadvertence of its lawyer. HELD: The appeal was dismissed. The plain and ordinary meaning of the words of s. 14(2) of the Act is that only the court appealed from has power to extend the time within which leave must be sought. Section 14(2) of the Act prevails over s. 9(6) of The Court of Appeal Act, 2000."
"All parties agree that the case turns on the interpretation of article XIV of the joint venture agreement, s. 14.01 of which provides that: If a party wishes to sell, assign, transfer, convey or otherwise dispose of all or part of its Participating Interest, the parties being absolutely prohibited from selling, assigning, transferring, conveying or disposing of any interest other than all of its participating Interest to establish its case that the voting agreement contravenes the terms of the Joint venture agreement. However, s14.01, with the words in parenthesis deleted, creates a complete right of first refusal. The words in the parenthesis, rather than being intended to create substantial new contractual obligations, were intended, as is buttressed by the parenthetical structure, merely to recall to the parties their dedication of assets to the joint joint venture and their inability to dispose of them qua non. HELD: The appeal was dismissed with costs to be taxed.","All parties agree that this case turns on the interpretation of article XIV, subsection 14.01 of the joint venture agreement. They also agree that the subsection is a right of first refusal clause. It is clear that the subject matter of the clause is a 'Participating Interest in the Program Land or a Project Area'. HELD: Appeal dismissed orally. The appellant relies on the words in parenthesis 'the Parties being absolutely prohibited from selling, assigning, transferring, conveying or otherwise disposing of any interest other than all of part of its Participating Interest' to establish its case that the voting agreement contravenes the terms of the joint venture agreement. However, subsection 14.01, with the words in parenthesis deleted, creates a complete right of first refusal. In our view, the words in parenthesis, rather than being intended to create substantial new contractual obligations, were intended, as is buttressed by the parenthetical structure, merely to recall to the parties their dedication of assets to the joint venture, and their inability to dispose of them qua separate assets. Thus, the phrase in parenthesis is mere surplusage in that it does not add or subtract substantively to subsection 14.01 or the joint venture agreement as a whole. Accordingly, the voting agreement is not caught by subsection 14.01."
"The plaintiffs filed an Originating Notice and Statement of Claim in 2000. They claimed that the defendant RBC caused them to suffer losses on investments. Two of the plaintiffs, who were associated in the practice of law, filed an application for want of prosecution pursuant to Rule 28.13 of the Civil Procedure Rules (1972). The application was dismissed in accordance with the 1972 Rules because it was filed before December 31, 2008. The plaintiffs submitted that RBC was responsible for a considerable period of delay and that it acquiesced to a slow tempo of litigation. They alleged damages for breach of fiduciary duty, breach of contract and breach of the contract. RBC counterclaimed for contribution and indemnity from RBC's solicitors in 1990. The Court refused to dismiss the action on the basis of (i) an inordinate delay; (ii) an inexcusable delay and (iii) the conduct of RBC, as a defendant, was to blame for the delay. It was not RBC who acquiesced or approved of the action. The solicitors did not file a list of documents. There were additional delays between the filing of the original Notice and the subsequent Notice of Intention to Proceed. There was additional time where nothing happened on the file due to delay by RBC. Even allowing for the two-and-a-half year delay, this means the delay of attributable to the plaintiffs was of some eight years.","The action, originally filed in 2000, concerned allegations of breach of - fiduciary duty, trust, industry regulations/standards, contract; and claims of negligence and malpractice. These claims related to the actions of an investor formerly employed by the defendant. The matter had languished at a slow pace for many years. The evidence showed the plaintiffs had taken three years to reply to a demand for particulars. There was also delay when the defendant requested a change in the plaintiff's counsel (because of a conflict of interest). The defendant applied to dismiss the plaintiffs' action, claiming want of prosecution under the Rule 28.13 of the old Civil Procedure Rules (1972), and asserting it has suffered significant prejudice as a result of the delay such that it will be impossible to properly defend the claim. Application dismissed. While there has been inordinate delay (eight-and-a-half-years) attributable to the plaintiffs, the defendant is also responsible for some of the delay (another two-and-a-half-years). While the plaintiff's delay could be considered inexcusable if viewed in isolation, the defendant's contribution to the delay is not irrelevant. There were actions on the part of the defendant that could be interpreted as acquiescing to the delay. After considering the case law concerning the circumstances in which a presumption of prejudice will arise as a result of the passage of time, the court found no presumption of prejudice here. On the facts, there is not a sufficient causal connection between the delay/blameworthy conduct and the prejudice. There is a significant documentary record of the transactions. The defendant has been in contact with its former employee and could have taken the opportunity to discover him sooner. The defendant's failure to act to secure the evidence available to them at time mitigates the effects of the passage of time. While there is a possibility of some prejudice should the matter proceed, the defendant has not established it will suffer serious prejudice. Even if there was serious prejudice, the balance of convenience weighs in favour of the plaintiffs given that dismissing the action would leave them with no other recourse."
"Applicants, Peter Boone and Loren Bough, seek to convert some $2.5 million of debentures issued by the respondent to Medusa Medical Technologies Inc. (MEDusa) into an action. Boone and Bough are taking steps to attempt to secure payment of their debenteures by means of an application to this Court. Medusa has commenced a separate action for damages against them. At issue is whether the respondent can quickly ascertain who their important witnesses will be; if so, what action will be taken. In any event, the respondent will have its costs on the motion to convert as it failed to satisfy the Court on a balance of probabilities that an application was not appropriate. At the same time, the moving party, Medusa, has failed to meet its burden of proving the proposition on a balanced of probabilities. HELD: The application is dismissed.  1) Rule 6.03(5) provides a number of factors which can go long way to make future events more predictable and more certain. 2) The affidavit evidence in this regard, as provided by both parties, is sketchy and speculative. There is a dearth of detail on the evidence, especially the witnesses the parties would introduce. This is a prime case for determining whether the parties can be ready to be heard in months rather than years. The issue that will necessarily drag the proceedings to years is the intended counterclaim by Medusa for as yet undeterminable, possible or potential economic losses allegedly caused by the Respondent's enforcement application.","motion dismissed. There are factors that suggest there is a presumption in favor of proceeding by way of an application (Rule 6.02(3)). The respondent failed to show that, on balance, an action is the preferable route. While not all of the witnesses will be ascertained quickly, the important ones can be, which is all that Rule 6.03(5)(a) requires. The hearing should be predictable in scope and length and ready to be heard within months. The issues are straightforward. The only thing that would cause delay is the intended counterclaim."
"HELD: The petitioner was granted joint custody with the mother with primary residence with the father and access for the mother. The parties had separated in November 2012. The petitioner filed an Answer and Counter-Petition in January 2013 contesting the respondent's claims for sole custody, specified and supervised parenting time, the request for restraining order and costs. The respondent counter-petitioned claiming division of property under the Family Property Act, S 1997, C-8.2, joint custody of Z. and S. to be with the wife and child support for the father set aside for 6 months. The interim agreement provided that the parties would have Z. in the interim care of the mother and that the respondent would receive parenting time. The mother was to have her own home. The father was to pay child support and the parties had been locked out. HELD: 1)The mother was concerned that the father was holding her child from her and that she needed to end the relationship. She telephoned the respondent the next morning principally to try and get the child back to her house. 2)The father was in constant pain and the mother was afraid to get out of his house. 3)All communication went through their lawyers. 4)The parties had followed the interim agreement which provided that all materials would be provided to the petitioner. 5)The evidence from the parties’ lawyers was that although the father had not seen the child for some time, he was often verbally abusive, grabbing the petitioner and hugging her and saying things like “I’m sorry” and “Get out of here!” The petitioner’s counsel had accurately summarized the verbalizations in the statement of mind given by the father that the child would not be able to sleep with her for several days because of the restrictions placed on his access to the computer and the Internet. 6)The petitioner was awarded one-half of the day and one-third of the parenting time that was to be paid for by the respondent. 7)The respondent was ordered to pay $600 in child support, the cost of the settlement and the costs of the application. 8)The wife was to bring the child to her home in Warman and the respondent was to provide the other half of the household with necessities such as books, toys and books. 9)The child was to spend one day with his mother in her home. 10)The parents would have access on a shared week-on/week basis until trial could be held","The court concluded that the respondent was not a credible, trustworthy, or reliable witness for many reasons. The petitioner, on the other hand, was found to be a truthful and reliable witness. The court was also impressed with the petitioner’s witnesses because they were close family members, long-time friends, and her live-in partner. By contrast, the respondent’s witnesses were friends seen from time to time, neighbours, and his mother. The court found the respondent’s mother to be evasive and guarded at times. To determine custody the court reviewed the factors set out in s. 8 of The Children’s Law Act, 1997. The petitioner was found to be the primary parent of the child since his birth. The court was left with a degree of uncertainty as to the day-to-day activities of the child when he was with the respondent. The quality of the child’s relationship with the petitioner was found to substantially exceed that of the respondent’s relationship with the child. The court accepted that the child said disturbing things upon his return to the petitioner from the respondent. The child’s need for a stable, reassuring, and positive home were found to be met in the petitioner’s home. The court indicated that decreasing the respondent’s time with the child may ameliorate the adverse effect on the child’s emotional needs. The child was also found to be afforded more social fulfillment in the petitioner’s care. The petitioner also had more constructive plans for the child’s future. The respondent’s negativity towards the petitioner was found to negatively impact his ability to parent. The court concluded that it was in the child’s best interests to primarily reside with the petitioner. The petitioner was granted sole custody of the child so as to minimize further conflict between the parties. The respondent was given unsupervised access every other weekend. The court added $5,000 to the petitioner’s line 150 income for the personal component of her vehicle expense deduction. After determining the respondent’s income the court found that the s. 3 Guideline child support due by the respondent to the petitioner was $676 per month and that he should be responsible for 37 percent of the s. 7 expenses. The petitioner did not request child support but instead asked the court to consider it in the distribution of property. The respondent discharged the onus of establishing a common-law relationship of two or more years. The respondent’s pension value available for division was found to be $11,663.97.  The court did not find an extraordinary circumstance to warrant an unequal division of the family home. The value of the home was $360,000. The court used the date of application to determine the amount owing on the home. The petitioner also had rental properties and was given an exemption of $90,641.43 for those properties. After taking into consideration all of the property and exemptions, the respondent failed to prove that he was entitled to any distribution under The Family Property Act. The petitioner did not claim an equalization payment. Costs were awarded to the petitioner and the respondent was restricted from bringing a further court application until those costs were paid."
"HAL applied for leave to appeal the decision of an arbitration panel. The arbitration panel had constituted to resolve a commercial contractual dispute between HAL and SecurTek. The dispute concerned the exclusive right to market, licence and distribute HAL's products in Canada. The parties entered into three separate contracts in 2008 that each provided that any disputes which could not be resolved by the parties would be settled by binding arbitration. The contracts each provided an implied condition that allowed the parties to appeal an arbitrators' decision based on an error of law, which the parties clearly intended to avoid. HELD: The application was dismissed. 1)The language of the agreements was so clear with respect to the arbitration clauses and their finality that it cannot be overridden by vagueness or inadvertent omission. 2)Leave to appeal under s.45(2) of the Act simply does not fall into the category of the obvious or something that 'it goes without saying' in the factual matrix of this case. Such an implied term is not akin, for instance, to the implied term of good faith in contractual negotiation, or the term of reasonable notice of termination in contracts of employment, and if there is a contrary intention on the part of either party, they cannot be taken to have abrogated their right to appeal. 3)The agreements were not intended to be a means for an arbitrator to reach a final decision on a final, binding arbitration decision. 4)The parties referred to one, and only one, specific instance in which an appeal would be permitted, which was a very narrow issue. There is simply no other reasonable interpretation of such wording.","HELD: The application for leave to appeal was dismissed. The court found that a term permitting an appeal from an arbitrator’s decision on an error of law did not fall into the category of the obvious and was not the same as an implied term, such as that of good workmanship in contracts for repair. The contractual language used by the parties was clear that they intended to resolve disputes by final and binding arbitration. Even if it had found that the parties had not contracted out of s. 45(2) of the Act, the application for leave would have been dismissed because the proposed grounds of appeal did not raise a pure issue of law."
"Civil Procedure – Default Judgment – AppealHELD: Pursuant to Rule 10-13 of The Queen's Bench Rules, Key's counsel applies to set aside the default judgment and seeks leave to file a defence. The plaintiff obtained default judgment against the defendant, The Key First Nation, totalling $102,703.62 plus costs assessed at $1,598.50. The default judgment was set aside on the basis that Sollows' counsel failed to exercise its authority to bind the plaintiff prior to the signing of the agreement. The Court cannot accept that a time frame of 28 days is sufficiently long for the court to prevent the plaintiff from defending the action. That is only 7 days past the date S.H. was permitted to note the action for default. Given that Key's then counsel responded to the action soon after it was entered, this delay is insufficient to deny the plaintiff its day in court.","HELD: The application was granted. The judgment was set aside and the defendant given leave to file its statement of defence. The court found that the judgment should be set aside as a matter of right because it was in excess of the amount due. The judgment was also set aside on the merits. It found that the time between service of the statement of claim and the default judgment was not sufficiently long to prevent the defendant from defending the action. As well, the defendant had provided an arguable defence to the claim in that it pled in its proposed defence of non-compliance with s. 2(3)(b) of the Indian Act. The delay had not caused the plaintiff irreparable harm."
21 year old appellant was convicted of armed robbery pursuant to s. 343(d) and s. 344 of the Criminal Code. He was sentenced to three years imprisonment and a ten year s. 100 order. He tried again to leave the convenience store with some of the submarine sandwiches while holding a pocket-knife. The Crown conceded this was a 'technically robbery' offence. The appeal against conviction was dismissed and a sentence of 1 year incarceration was imposed along with a 10 year section 100 order HELD: The Crown appealed the conviction. The Court of Appeal agreed with the Crown the robbery was at the low end of the scale of seriousness and what originally would have been a simple shop-lifting became more serious because of the altercation between the clerk and the appellant.,"The 21 year old appealed his conviction of armed robbery, the sentence of three years imprisonment and a ten year s.100 order. HELD: The conviction appeal was dismissed, the sentence appeal was allowed and one year incarceration with a ten year s100 order were imposed. The Crown was correct in characterizing the incident as technically a robbery which was at the low end of the scale of seriousness. What originally would have been a shop-lifting became more serious because of the altercation between the clerk and the appellant."
"The plaintiff municipal tax payer paid its property taxes as assessed for the years 1994, 1995, 1996 and 1997 but on appeal was held entitled to a refund for each of the three years in the total of $420,177.13.  The plaintiff sought interest pursuant to s. 41(i) of the Judicature Act, supra on the refund from the date it made the overpayments in response to HRM's tax invoices requiring payment of those amounts on the due dates. The Nova Scotia Court of Appeal upheld the Utility and Review Board's assessment determination which translated into $420 in value. Canada Trust sought interest on the overpayment of taxes for the five month period between the Nova Scotia court of appeal assessment determination in March 1997 and the payment of the property tax refund in September 1997 as well as on the unpaid interest until the date of judgment.  Awarding a refund of overpaid taxes to the plaintiff was not an appropriate interest claim. An interest rate of 8.75% being a rate equatable to the interest charged by HRM on overdue taxes (prime plus 4%) was an appropriate rate on the principal amount of $410,177,13 fro m March 3, 1997 to the date the assessment was reduced and on the pending interest only from September 6, 1997 until September 6 1997.  Court ordered counsel to make the appropriate calculations and subject to any agreement to hear the parties as to costs.","The plaintiff paid its municipal property taxes as assessed for three years. On appeal it was held to be entitled to a refund for each of the three years in the total amount of $420,000. The plaintiff, pursuant to s. 41(I) of the Judicature Act, sought payment of interest on this amount from the date of the payments. Awarding 5 months interest, that the date from which interest is calculated in this type of action is upon completion of the appeal process. An appropriate interest claim under s. 41(I) therefore only exists for the five month period between the Court of Appeal's assessment determination and the refund of the property tax five months later."
"This appeal was taken under s. 33.1 of The Municipal Board Act. It was from a decision of the Assessment Appeals Committee of the Saskatchewan Municipal Board. It is one of a series of appeals heard at the same time dealing with the application of a newly introduced market adjustment factor to assessments for municipal tax purposes. HELD: The appeal was allowed on the same basis as the grounds of appeal in respect of the 1997 assessment of Market Mall. 1) Market Mall was built in 1966 and underwent expansions in 1979, 1982, 1987 and 1992. As with all other fully enclosed shopping centres in Saskatoon, the assessor calculated MAF of 0.94 for the mall. 2) In this case, the appellant only raised two issues: 1) Did the assessment Appeals Committee erred in law by concluding that functional obsolescence does not apply to an add-on type of construction or by finding that there must be an inability of an improvement to perform the function for which it is used? Or, to put it another way, it was decided on the evidence or lack thereof. 3) The decision was arrived at not as a result of any wrong interpretation of the manual but because of the failure to establish to the satisfaction of the committee the facts on which it based its case.","An appeal under s.33.1 of the Municipal Board Act from a decision of the Assessment Appeals Committee of the Saskatchewan Municipal Board, one in a series of appeals heard at the same time dealing with the application of a newly introduced market adjustment factor (MAF) to assessments for municipal tax purposes. In issue was whether the assessor erred in law by misconstruing or misapplying the provisions of the Assessment Manual in determining the MAF for the appellant's shopping centre properties by using a single sale to calculate the MAF; and by creating as a commercial building neighbourhood the grouping of fully enclosed shopping centres which encompassed the entire city. HELD: 1)The assessment was set aside and the matter was remitted to the assessor to be dealt with according to the manual. Both issues were dealt with in Cadillac Fairview v. Saskatoon (TWL CA00074) and the same reasoning applied. 2)The appellant conceded that the question of whether the various expansions of the shopping centre resulted in abnormal functional economic obsolescence was a question of mixed law and fact and was thus beyond the scope of this appeal. 3)The second branch of the appeal was dismissed. Whether the committee erred in law by saying the definition of functional obsolescence did not apply to an add-on type of construction was beside the point since that was not the ground for the decision. The decision was not the result of any wrong interpretation of the manual but was the result of the appellant's failure to establish to the committee's satisfaction the facts on which it based its case. The decision was therefore beyond the Court of Appeal's jurisdiction to review.  4)There was no order as to costs as success was divided."
"Six persons shared an upstairs apartment. The complainant was the boyfriend of another tenant. The parties had been drinking in the basement and had stumbled into a fight in the living room. The accused, who had invited the complainant to join them for a fight, advanced and struck the complainant in the face. HELD: The accused was charged with assault causing bodily harm. The Court found that the accused cannot rely on the Criminal Code s.34(1) for his defence. His subjective belief that the action of the complainant presented to him an imminent danger of grievous bodily harm and that his counter action was necessary to protect himself was not reasonable. On the total evidence, the Court found there was no evidence to support the conclusion that without justification the accused provoked the assault upon himself.","The accused was charged with assault causing bodily harm. The complainant willingly took part in a fight club after which the accused followed him and engaged in a second physical altercation with him. During the fight, the parties fell into a dresser, onto the floor and out a window. At some stage of the fight, the complainant sustained a nasal fracture, which was the basis of the charge. Accused not guilty of assault causing bodily harm. The confrontation between the accused and the complainant was one continuing episodic event and the complainant's actions were provoked by the accused. However, no causal relationship was shown between the blows of the accused and the broken nose sustained by the complainant. There were too many variables and probabilities as to how the complainant's nose might have become broken."
"FIAT: The petitioner applies to have arrears fixed with regard to s. expenses related to her daughter's post-secondary education and in addition requests that the amount of the ongoing s. 7 expenses be specified. HELD: 1) The respondent has not paid any s.7 expenses since Justice Dickson’s September 23, 2004 order. In addition, in addition to ongoing support for the parties’ oldest child, Corry and the two youngest children, the petitioner also claims for 2003/2004 s.8 expenses. The respondent also objects to some of the educational expenses claimed by the petitioner. It is uncontroverted that the respondent has disabilities which necessitate certain tools such as a computer to be successful in her postsecondary education. Accordingly, the respondent accepts responsibility for his proportionate share, being 66% of the cost of any retainers required by Brina. 2) The Court finds the respondent to have reasonable idea of the extent to which his postsecondary costs are related to the 2006/2007 university year by September 2006. It also finds that the crisis prevention class was a reasonable expense incurred on the respondent”s part and will assist her in her future plans. The Zellers supplies, however, would normally be covered under Table support. 3) The petitioner was awarded $391.80 per month for the 2005/2006 year by virtue of the court order. The Court also awarded $1,000,000 in student loans to third parties.","FIAT: The sole issue before the court is the amount to be fixed for the ongoing s. 7 expenses. The s. 7 expenses claimed by the petitioner include dental work of $112.90 for Kristen, orthodontic work for Brina and costs associated with Brina's post-secondary education. It is uncontroverted that Brina has disabilities that necessitate certain tools such as a computer for her to be successful in her post-secondary training. HELD: 1) The respondent accepts responsibility for his proportionate share of the girls' dental and orthodontic expenses and there shall be an order accordingly. 2) The September 2004 consent order provided that computer repairs and equipment were included in Brina's s. 7 expenses. Accordingly the costs relating to the computer are legitimate s. 7 costs. 2) The crisis prevention class was a reasonable expense incurred on Brina's part and will assist her with her future plans. 3) The Zeller's supplies would normally be covered under the Table support and that expense is disallowed. 4) Brina's s. 7 post-secondary expenses are $7,123.72 and include tuition, crisis prevention class and books, required university books, bus pass, black cartridge for the printer, Shaw internet, Microsoft licence, computer repairs and updated virus protection."
"At a June 2, 2006 trial in Provincial Court, the appellants were found guilty of breaching a bylaw of the Rural Municipality of Vanscoy No.345. The trial justice convicted them of breaching Bylaw 2-1995, which provides that no poultry or livestock be permitted in districts zoned hamlet. The appellants did not lead evidence at trial. They did not dispute that they were keeping cattle on their property. Their defence related to points of law. HELD: The application to admit new evidence was dismissed. 1)The appellants had not given notice under the Constitutional Questions Act. Notice is required when the constitutionality of bylaw is questioned. 2)The uncertainty suggested by these appellants does not exist. Under the no livestock policy in the province, no livestock is permitted in the district. Cattle are livestock, and so the bylaw under which they were convicted is not adduced. The appeal could have been allowed on appeal if it bears upon a decisive or potentially decisive issue in the trial. 3)There was no basis on the trial decision based on the argument the three bylaws were tendered. The first bylaw purports to be an amendment to the rural municipality's zoning bylaw. The amendments in this document are not reflected in the version of the zoning bylaws that was put in evidence at the trial and thus it shares the lack of relevance. 4)The bylaw referred to an operation relating to keeping livestock, 'livestock', includes cattle. The second bylaw, which prohibits livestock in district zoned 'Hamlet', shares the similarity to the 'hamlet' but is not the current version. 5)The trial justice made no error in law. His findings of fact were supported by the evidence.","The appellants were found guilty of breaching a rural municipal bylaw which provides 'That no poultry or livestock be permitted in districts zoned Hamlet [sic].' There were four grounds of appeal: 1) an application to admit new evidence on appeal; 2) a constitutional challenge seeking a declaration that the bylaw was ultra vires for uncertainty; 3) the significance of the word 'hamlet' in the bylaw; and 4) the meaning of the word 'livestock' in the bylaw. HELD: The appeal is dismissed. 1) New evidence will not be admitted on an appeal if, by due diligence, it could have been adduced at trial. Further, new evidence will be admitted only if it bears upon a decisive or potentially decisive issue in the trial. Neither of these requirements is met. 2) The constitutional challenge is not properly before the Court as notice is required when the constitutionality of a bylaw is impugned. In any event, the uncertainty on which the appellants rely in attacking the bylaw does not exist. 3) The appellants misunderstand the use of the word 'hamlet' in the bylaw. 4) Whatever definition of 'livestock' is used, the definition always includes cattle."
"The applicant Board applied for an order pursuant to the Civil Procedure Rules 14.25(1) and 38.11 to strike the affidavits of Sonya Lorette and her colleagues as an attempt to put evidence to the court on matters not in or forming part of the Record of the Council Panel. The Attorney General had previously dismissed the applicant Board's application. The applicant sought to have the affidavit evidence struck as being inconsistent with the Board's positions on several issues concerning the validity of the Merks brothers' licences and their respective roles in the application of the management plan. In addition, the applicant argued that the Court ought to restrict itself to considering the record as produced by the tribunal and not to allowing the application to proceed. Application dismissed; the affidavit evidence is admissible; the record is not an issue for the purposes of this application; if the matter is a jurisdictional dispute the application can be dismissed as a matter of fact rather than a new hearing.","The defendant council, charged with the general oversight and administration of matters under the Natural Products Marketing Act, delegated certain authority to commodity boards such as the plaintiff. The plaintiff requested that the defendant hold a show cause hearing to determine whether certain producers had contravened their licence but when a procedural breakdown occurred as to how that hearing would be conducted, with the plaintiff seeking and being denied an adjournment, the hearing was held without the plaintiff's participation. The plaintiff brought an application for mandamus to compel the defendant to hold a new hearing and filed two affidavits providing some detail and background information as to its reasoning for its failure to attend the hearing and the parties' differing positions regarding their respective roles in the application of the management plan. The defendant brought an application to strike certain of the affidavits filed by the plaintiff on the basis that they were an attempt to put evidence to the court on matters not forming part of the record. Application to strike affidavits dismissed; the Rules do not preclude the admission of affidavits on an application and, in the present circumstances, reason and fairness militated against ruling the affidavits inadmissible. There was no authority for denying the parties the use of affidavits should this application proceed as a jurisdictional dispute and, should it proceed by way of an error of law on the face of the record, the affidavits were also admissible to complete the record."
"The applicant mother sought a lifting of the stay of execution on the judgment of the trial judge (indexed as 2013 SKQB 212 (CanLII)) which was automatically imposed upon the father's appeal from that decision. HELD: The application was granted and the stay was lifted in accordance with the factors set out in s. 8(a)(i) of the Children's Law Act. The reasons for the decision were: 1) the mother's lack of involvement in the child's life was due more to concern that the father would be held responsible for an injustice than any other factor; and 2) the father had not bothered to have any involvement with the child from the time he was an infant until he was again contacted by the mother. The father's seeming inability to facilitate access to his mother and his sister especially where access has been ordered by the court, is of considerable concern. The court lifted the stay in proceedings arising pursuant to Rule 15(4).","The respondent mother applied to lift the stay of execution imposed by Court of Appeal Rule 15(1) when the appellant father appealed the trial judge's decision to award custody of the parties' son to the mother with the child to have access to the father for one extended weekend per month during the school year (see: 2013 SKQB 212). The trial judge had found that both parties had exhibited a lack of interest in their child and there was little to distinguish either of them as the better custodial parent. As the mother had facilitated the father's access to the child and he had not demonstrated the same willingness and that the most important relationship in the child's life was with his sister, who resides with the mother, the trial judge found that it was in the child's best interest to foster that relationship and grant custody to the mother. HELD: The Court granted the application. There would be no harm to the child if the stay was lifted. The father was directed to perfect his appeal and the stay of proceedings arising from Court of Appeal Rule 15(4) was also lifted."
"The tenant was served with notice to deliver up premises municipally described as 201 1st Street West in the Town of Blaine Lake. When this failed to produce the desired result, a writ of possession was issued. The tenant did not attend and in his absence a writ was issued authorizing possession of the premises. HELD: The appeal was allowed and the order of the Rentalsman and the consequent writ of possessions were quashed. There was no costs of the appeal.","A notice to vacate rented premises contained an erroneous address. The Rentalsman granted a writ of possession and after the issuance of the writ, amended the writ to correct the address without notice to the tenant. The tenant appealed. HELD: Appeal allowed. There had not been compliance with s. 23(1)(b) of the Act. The notice to vacate was therefore ineffective and the consequent writ of possession was quashed. Given the tenant's obstructionist tactics he was denied his costs of the appeal."
"The owner of a land subject to a right of way in favor of all landholders out of the original undivided piece of land refused to consent to the registration. The applicant sought an order in the nature of mandamus directing the Registrar to accept the applicant's property without a declaration of consent from users of the right ofway or, in the alternative, a declaration that such consent is not required by that section of the Act. The Registrar of Condominiums advised the applicant that s.11(b) of the act prohibits him from registering a declaration with respect to the property unless the owners of right of right-of-way consent consent. The Applicant had not formally applied to the Registrar ofCondominiums for registration. HELD: The application was granted. The Court was prepared to issue a declaration in favorof the applicant and pointing out to the registrar of Condos that consent is neither required nor required of users of rights-of‑way over servient tenements.","The applicant landowner sought to register a declaration with the respondent respecting a condominium property, which was subject to a right of way in favour of all the original landowners. An adjacent landowner refused to consent to the declaration. The applicant sought a declaration that the consent of the adjacent landowner was not required. Granting the application, that the word 'encumbrance' as defined in s.3(1)(o) of the Act involves a security feature and as there is no security feature to a right of way, unlike a mortgage or lien, it is not an encumbrance. The consent of the adjacent landowner, who had a right of way over a servient tenement, was not required."
The defendant applied to strike the plaintiff's summary application in relation to its use of solicitor as a witness. The application was supported by the 17 page 123 paragraph affidavit of the plaintiff. The intervenor was allowed to cross-examine on the affidavit. At issue was the application to remove the solicitor from his practice and the application concerning the use of a solicitor in the employ of the defendant. The applicant put himself in the position of a witness who may be cross-examination. Rule 10.11 of the Nova Scotia Barristers' Society Handbook and Code of Ethics was not to be taken as precedent.,"The plaintiffs original application was supported by her solicitor's affidavit. The Defence wanted the solicitor removed. The solicitor agreed to withdraw from the original application but wanted to appear on the Defence's interlocutory application to strike. Ordering the solicitor not to continue in the original or any related applications, that a lawyer has a duty not to give evidence in a matter in which he or she is involved as counsel except in merely formal or uncontroverted matters. Here the applications were so closely related that where it was improper to act in one, it was improper to act in the other."
"A young offender escaped custody following his guilty plea to four Criminal Code offences. He was sentenced to a 5 months closed custody disposition concurrent to a 9 month open custody disposition previously imposed. Shortly after he started to serve his 9 month closed custody sentence, he escaped custody and took a truck from the parking lot of a residence. A police officer tried to stop the truck, but the vehicle was driven off side of an attached garage. The Crown appealed the sentence. HELD: The sentence was reduced to 5 months secure custody, concurrent to the 9 month remaining open custody sentence. 1)The sentence was not fit with the background of the offender, his previous record and the nature of the offences committed, including the escape custody and dangerous driving, which were all in breach of probation. 2)The offender was 18 at the time of this appeal.","The accused, a young offender, was convicted of escaping lawful custody, theft of property valued in excess $1,000.00, dangerous driving and being in possession of stolen property. A Provincial Court Judge sentenced him to 5 months closed custody concurrent with a sentence of 9 months open custody which he was serving at the time of his escape. The Crown appealed. HELD: Appeal allowed. 1)The accused had a lengthy record as a young offender and turned 18 two days after the commission of the last of the offences for which he was being sentenced. 2)The Court substituted a sentence of 12 months closed custody, concurrent with the 9 months open custody which he was already serving."
"The plaintiff Seeds claims damages from the defendant for an alleged breach of contract. The plaintiff Seeds purchases specialty crops from producers and contracts with purchasers, including other traders or packagers, for the resale of these specialty crops. To secure the product for resale, the plaintiff entered into contracts with growers prior to the seeding and harvesting of the same. The contract stipulated that the plaintiff should receive a fully executed copy of the contract by January 2, 1994. The defendant attempts to have matching contracts for the quantum of specialty crops required with various producers with options for differing times of delivery to match the demand of the purchaser and to meet the delivery date requirements in the sales contracts. HELD: 1)The plaintiff had verbally confirmed on at least two occasions that he did have a contract with Johnson Seeds and at all times the defendant confirmed that such a contract did exist. 2)There was a valid contract between the plaintiff and Johnson Seeds. In the instant case the contract was signed in person, by telephone, by fax and by mail. 3)Although it may have been in the reasonable contemplation of the plaintiff that he would receive back a fully formed copy of a contract, there was no doubt that in the telephone conversations he had with the defendant in November and December 1993, he verbally confirmed that a contract existed. 4)Johnson Seeds knew that it had a binding and legally enforceable contract and it was important that it be clearly stated in the contract. 5)In all discussions prior to May 1993 the plaintiff had used the mail to communicate the offer to the defendant. The post office was legitimate agent of Johnson Seeds for the purpose of communicating the acceptance of the offer and confirmed that it was a contract. 6)The defendant knew that the formal written contract (signed by both parties in May 1993 and in November 1993) was an instrument to revoke the offer. 7)It was incumbent on the plaintiff to insist that this term be expressly stated in his contract. Whether the plaintiff took calculated risk and sold the canary seed was an issue.","The plaintiff, a specialty seed marketing company, claimed damages from the defendant for an alleged breach of contract. Johnson Seeds entered contracts with growers prior to the seeding and harvesting to secure product for resale. After extended negotiations the defendant eventually signed and mailed the standard form contract but never received an executed copy. The price of the canary seed escalated substantially during 1993. The defendant thought that as he did not have a copy of the contract signed by the plaintiff it was not a valid contract and sold the seed to a third party for more than double the contract price. HELD: Johnson Seeds was awarded judgment for $50,850.05 and pre-judgment interest together with costs of the action. 1)There was a valid contract between the parties. Damages were assessed as of January 1994 when Johnson Seeds knew that the defendant was in breach of the contract. 2)The issue was whether communication by delivery of the fully executed contract was necessary to complete the contract. The parties communicated by fax, mail and telephone. There was no doubt that the defendant verbally confirmed that a contract did exist. Discussions prior to May 1993 were pre-contractual negotiations. 3)Johnson Seed knew that it was prepared to pay 10 cents only if delivery occurred after January 1/94. The formal contract did not expressly set forth these conditions. Both parties knew these terms were absent when they executed the contract but both considered that they had a legally binding contract in 1993.  4)Farr took a calculated risk and sold the seed which alleviated his immediate cash-flow problem. Johnson Seeds waited until the last possible day under the written contract terms to call the contract in an effort to position itself to claim increased damages for breach of contract."
"The issue was whether it was appropriate for the Court to require the accused to commence the trial by calling evidence on a Charter voir dire, where the accused has given notice of a Charter application. This would differ from the procedure which is usually utilized, wherein the Crown commences the trial in the trial proper and thereafter the accused applies to the court for leave to apply the Crown evidence to the Charter application, where it is appropriate to do so, and in addition to calling other defence evidence on the application. HELD: The application was dismissed.  1)It is in the interest of conducting an orderly trial that the trial judge is entitled to insist and should insist that defence counsel state his or her position on possible Charter issues, either before or at the outset of the trial. All issues of notice to the Crown and sufficiency of disclosure can be sorted out at that time. 2)This can quite properly occur by the application to exclude evidence of some or all of the evidence which is already before the court and on the record on the substantive issues. The admissibility of that evidence can be reserved pending the determination of the Charter issue on its merits and the application of s.24 remedy, if any.","The issue was whether it was appropriate for the court to require the accused to commence the trial by calling evidence on a Charter voir dire, where the accused gave notice of a Charter application. This would differ from the usual procedure, wherein the Crown commences the trial by calling its witnesses in the trial proper, and thereafter the accused applies for leave to apply the Crown evidence to the Charter application, where it is appropriate, in addition to calling other defence evidence on the application.HELD: In R. v. Kutynec, the court made the following determinations: 1) whatever procedures are used should not unnecessarily interfere with the inherent jurisdiction of the trial judge to control the conduct of the trial; 2) instead of creating procedures for Charter applications in provincial court, it is better to leave judges the discretion to determine matters such as sufficiency of notice and the extent of the offer of proof; 3) counsel should give timely notice to the Crown of the Charter issue, and at trial, the accused should be able to state with reasonable particularity the grounds upon which the application is made; 4) objections to admissibility of evidence must be made before or when the evidence is proffered; 5) the onus is on the accused to demonstrate on a balance of probabilities that he or she is entitled to a Charter remedy; 6) the trial judge should insist defence counsel state his or her position on possible Charter issues, either before or at the outset of the trial; 7) failing timely notice, a trial judge is entitled to refuse an application to assert a Charter remedy; 8) fairness may require the accused be given some latitude to explore potential Charter issues which he or she had no opportunity to develop prior to trial; and 9) the trial judge must control the proceedings to ensure this legitimate exploration does not become a fishing expedition. In R. v. Loveman, the court said the trial judge must ensure fairness and preserve the integrity of the trial process. This may require a judge to refuse to hear a motion where insufficient notice has been given, even when the motion involves an application to exclude evidence under s. 24 of the Charter. In R. v. Habhab, the court was asked to consider a procedure which involved entering into voir dire at the start of the trial and the Crown proceeding to lead their evidence at the outset regarding the Charter application and substantive issue. The court dismissed this proposal and stated that the case law implies it is the accused's obligation to lead the evidence on the voir dire. The court was not able to justify the proposed procedure. If the authorities imply there is an obligation on the accused to call evidence first on the Charter voir dire, this can occur by the application of some or all the evidence which is already on the record on the substantive issues. The admissibility of evidence can be reserved by the court pending judgment on the Charter and any s. 24 remedy. An advantage of having the Crown evidence on record at the outset is it removes uncertainty as to the nature of the testimony as it relates to the Charter application. This is preferable to the accused calling the Crown witness at the outset on the voir dire, discovering aspects of the evidence are contrary or unfavourable, and then having to convince the court to grant leave to cross-examine. It avoids a scenario where the Crown witness evidence is led by the defence on the voir dire, and then the accused must impeach the creditability of this witness in cross-examination as it relates to the proof of the substantive issues. The court concluded the fairness of the proceedings and public confidence in the administration of justice, were best served by the Crown first leading its evidence on the charge alleged and the accused having leave to request the evidence be applied to the Charter issue, if appropriate."
"The accused was charged under s. 253(b) of the Criminal Code with operating a motor vehicle when his blood alcohol level exceeded the prescribed limit. The accused was found to have reasonable and probable grounds for a blood demand. Blood demand acceded to and the accused was convicted of impaired driving. The Court found that the accused possessed sufficient understanding of the circumstances surrounding the accident to conclude that the blood demand was a legitimate demand for sample and that he had not waived his right to counsel as required by law. Furthermore, the accused demonstrated an honest and reasonable understanding of his situation through words and actions spanning a significant period of time. There was no evidence of mechanical defects or failures in the accused's vehicle.","The accused was charged with operating a vehicle when his blood alcohol level exceeded the prescribed limit and impaired driving. After being involved in an accident, the accused was taken to hospital where a blood demand was given and eventually acceded to. The accused challenged the validity of the blood demand and argued that his right to counsel was violated. Accused guilty of operating a vehicle when his blood alcohol level exceeded the prescribed limit; there was no violation of the accused's right to counsel. The officer had valid grounds to make the demand, having been advised that the accused was in an accident, that someone had said the accused was either high or intoxicated, having smelled a mild odour of alcohol on the accused and the accused having advised him that he only had three beer. Even if the accused's claim to amnesia for all the events around that time was believed, there was no medical evidence to suggest that he could not understand what the officer said to him at the hospital. Although his degree of alertness may have fluctuated, he displayed an understanding of the situation by showing appropriate concern for how much he had been drinking and asking questions which showed an understanding of his situation and what speaking to counsel would entail."
"An application for a DNA warrant was made by the prosecutor and, pursuant to s.487.05 of the Code, an officer was required to appear before the judge to swear the Information to Obtain the Search Warrant. The Provincial Court Judge had previously swore an Information on an Ex parte application but had since changed his mind and sworn the Information on the Form 5.01 form which was incorporated into the form. The applicant now argued that the Information as sworn before the Judge elevates form over substance in the context of the concerns raised by the applicant about the potential prejudicial or negative effects of a personal attendance by the judge. Granting the application, that the information is on sworn Information and it's in accordance with the Code. To ask the question whether there is any more truth in an officer's affidavit of Information because he swore it before a provincial judge or a Notary Public rather than before a commissioner of oaths or a notary public, that seems to me to be the better practice. The better practice is to put as much as you can in the Information and to deal with Informations, except in emergency situations as provided for in that protocol.","An application for a DNA warrant on the basis s.487.05 (the general warrant provision) of the Criminal Code with respect to DNA warrants does not refer to a form. The applicant suggested a tape recording would avoid the potential problems in bringing the application before a Provincial Court Judge. HELD: These concerns were raised in the January 21 decision concerning potential prejudicial or negative effects, which outweigh any requirement to swear the Information before a judge. An oath taken before a commissioner or notary is as valid as it is before a provincial court judge and avoids all the possible problems that relate to personal attendance. The intention is to make protocol work as flexible as possible, not impeding the police in their legitimate role, while making sure the court maintains its independence. Form 5.01 is specifically set out in the Code. Section 487.1 does not have a form, but even if it did and used the same words 'taken before me', that would elevate form over substance in a significant way."
"The applicant applied to vary spousal support provisions of the Corollary Relief Judgment. Although the parties were married for over 29 years prior to their separation, the divorce settlement was made into an agreement incorporating the terms of that agreement. The applicant found that there had been no material change in the circumstances of either of the parties since it was signed and that the respondent did not take advantage of any vulnerability as contemplated by the Supreme Court in Miglin (supra). HELD: The application was dismissed with costs. 1)The Agreement was sound when signed and there have been no changes in circumstances. The parties agreed to be bound by the provisions of this Agreement. There was no pressure exerted upon the applicant and no oppression during the course of the negotiations or the signing of the Agreement and the rental income more than covered the mortgage payment. 2)There was no evidence of coersion or anything of that nature. The agreement was designed to avoid the necessity of future court proceedings. Retirement was contemplated by both parties and by the Respondent in particular and the Agreement was designed with retirement in mind. 3)The agreement was not unconscionable. The mere presence of vulnerabilities will not justify the court's intervention. The degree of professional assistance received by the parties will often overcome any systemic imbalances between the parties. The rental income was surpassed by the portion of household expenses which were borne by the applicant. 4)There were no adverse impacts on the applicant's earning capacity following the separation.","Two years after the divorce, the wife applied to vary the spousal support provisions of the parties' Corollary Relief Judgment, which incorporated the terms of Minutes of Settlement. Pursuant to the Corollary Relief judgment, the husband was currently paying the wife $4,350 per month as spousal support. The wife now wished to increase the monthly support to a figure which would more closely resemble that assessed pursuant to the Spousal Support Advisory Guidelines, along with a substantial lump sum to compensate her for the underpayment of spousal support for the past two years. She also sought removal of a clause which provided for the discontinuation of support if the husband's professional income dropped below $80,000. The parties had been married for approximately thirty years and had one child, who was now independent. Application dismissed; the parties' current circumstances did not constitute a significant departure from the range of reasonable outcomes anticipated by the parties when the Agreement was signed. Both parties' income had increased since the divorce and the wife was not deeply in debt, as she alleged; there was no pressure exerted and no oppression during the course of negotiations; the Spousal Support Advisory Guidelines are not law and allow for exceptions to the general formulas provided, one such exception being the assumption of debt by one of the parties (the husband in this case); the spousal support figure recognized the husband's reasonable expectation of retirement and the fact that he was experiencing health problems; it was completely foreseeable at the time that the Agreement was signed that, given the wife's age, she might experience difficulty in finding employment in her narrow field; the subsequent increased value of one of the husband's properties was not a reason to vary the spousal support provisions of the Agreement."
"The defendant was charged with the death of his sister and three others when his car veered off the road and struck a power pole. The accident victim, a farmer, claimed that he swerved to avoid hitting a dog that ran onto the highway. Others brought an action against the defendant, alleging negligence in the ownership and operation of the vehicle. The chambers judge dismissed the summary judgment application, holding that the applicant had met the burden placed upon him in applying the test for summary judgment. The issue before the court was whether the chambers judge erred in the application or whether the judge misinterpreted the test. The test is well established and has been reiterated by the court in Milbury v. Nova Scotia (Attorney General), [1999] N.S.J. No. 124 (Q.L.) (NSCA) and in Eikelenboom, [1988] BC. The requirement for leave to appeal an interlocutory order is found in Judicature Act s. 240 (d. 240), save by leave of the Court of Appeal. Rule 62.11 allows a third party to invoke Rule 13.01 to challenge a plaintiffs claim. In this case, the Chambers judge appeared to blur the two parts of the test and seemed to forget that there was at least a genuine issue that should be left to be determined at trial. He did not refer at all to the real chance of success test.","A single vehicle accident occurred when the driver swerved to avoid hitting a dog that ran onto the highway. An action was brought against both the driver and the farmer who owned the land on both sides of the highway on the basis that the farmer owned the dog in question and was negligent in failing to keep it off the highway. The farmer contended that although he owned a dog, it was tied to a tree at the time and his was not the dog that had run onto the highway. When his application for summary judgment was dismissed, the farmer appealed. Appeal dismissed. At this stage of the proceedings, it was not necessary for the plaintiffs to prove that the defendant's dog contributed to the accident or the truth of the statements and evidence attached to the affidavit. It was only necessary to show that the facts were contested, there was some evidence to support their version of events and, if their evidence was accepted by the trier of fact, their action had some merit. Although the judge appeared to blur the two parts of the test on a summary judgment application, the Court found that the farmer failed to meet the first part of the test; namely, that there was no genuine issue of fact for trial as there was conflicting evidence as to the identity of the dog involved."
"The plaintiff was charged with dangerous driving causing death following a serious motor vehicle accident. Following the laying of criminal charges, the plaintiff's employer suspended him from work without pay. They offered, however at their expense, the use of their legal counsel to defend him in relation to the criminal charges. The plaintiff filed an expert's report alleging that the trial judge erred in admitting into evidence the video re-enactment of the accident that had been prepared by the police and in allowing into evidence, the opinion of an RCMP traffic analyst when there was an insufficient factual basis established for his opinion. The expert's evidence was not admissible and, in light of the fact that the video was taped at the defendant's expense and the fact the still photographs were not being admitted into evidence at the appeal, the court found that the opinions expressed in the report were not adduced.","The plaintiff bus driver was in a serious bus/motor vehicle accident that killed two people. He was charged with dangerous driving. His employer offered the services of its lawyer, who eventually transferred the file to the defendant who represented him at trial. At trial, the Crown introduced a video of a purported accident re-enactment. The defendant chose not to object to its admission, saying he felt it was a perfect example of the Crown's 'doomed to failure' theory. As for the problems (it was recorded in the daytime, while the accident happened at daybreak; it assumed the vehicle that was struck was stopped, although there was no proof it was; and it didn't show all of the vehicles at the original scene), he felt these could be addressed by cross-examination. The plaintiff was convicted. He retained a different lawyer to represent him on appeal, and won. Eventually, the charges were dropped. The lawyer's competence was not raised as an issue on appeal. In their decision, the Court of Appeal criticized him for not objecting to the admission of the video and other evidence. They found this evidence was inadmissible, highly prejudicial and should never have been put to the jury. The plaintiff sued in negligence and breach of contract. The parties introduced conflicting opinions from criminal law experts to support their respective positions. Action dismissed. The standard of care is that of a reasonably competent lawyer. Lawyers make strategic decisions and exercise judgment, but are not responsible to ensure a certain result. Sometimes the decisions are wrong: it is only negligence if it was outside the realm of acceptable possibilities in the circumstances of the case. The appeal panel had the benefit of hindsight - it is improper to judge the plaintiff's actions in light of their conclusions. While the experts were not helpful in establishing what a reasonably competent lawyer (as opposed to a specialist in the field) would do, their differing opinions illustrate how the admissibility of evidence can be the subject of much debate."
"FIAT: By order and judgment dated March 29, 2010, the Court of Appeal certified the within action as a class action. The defendants were granted leave to appeal the certification order and all other aspects of the order pursuant to s. 39(3)(a) of The Class Actions Act. A number of grounds of appeal were advanced including that relating to the breach of duty of care cause of action. HELD: 1)Leave was granted. Steps were now available to move the matter forward concurrently with the appeal even though there was an appeal pending on only one aspect of the certifying order. Steps could now be taken to move this action forward at this time given that there is an appeal in the matter pending before the court of appeal. 2)The class action was definitely advancing and it was not known whether the class action would proceed on the basis of one cause of actions or two.  3)The situation that now exists is that the class actions will definitely advance, although, until after the appeal concerning the CPA cause of Action is finally determined, it is not known if the class will proceed on a basis of either cause of an action orTwo. 4)The plaintiffs requested a case management conference call to address the next steps. A conference call was convened in September 2010 at which time the parties were given the opportunity to discuss possible moves. 5)The plaintiff took the position steps could be taken. Steps had been granted in relation to the possible timeline for the matter to move forward.","A class action was certificated at Queen's Bench on the basis of breaches of The Consumer Protection Act and a breach of duty of care. The defendants were granted leave from the Court of Appeal to appeal the portion of the certification order dealing with alleged breaches of The Consumer Protection Act only. The certification on the basis of duty of care was upheld. As a result, a situation existed where the class action process could continue on only part of the claim until the appeal of consumer protection act issues was heard. HELD: Rule 15 of The Court of Appeal Rules is engaged and the entire certification judgment is stayed pending the disposition of the appeal. If the plaintiffs wish to apply to lift the stay they must do so to a judge of the Court of Appeal."
The accused was charged with two counts being driving over.08 contrary to s. 253 of the Criminal Code and one count being impaired by alcohol. The accused was granted leave to cross-examine on the information to obtain blood samples as a result of the breach of his rights under s. 8 of the Charter to be free from unreasonable search and seizure. HELD: 1) The accused's blood alcohol concentration at the time of the accident was.08.  2) The Court found that the officer had not provided sufficient detail in the Information to Obtain so as to permit the Justice of the Peace to determine that reasonable grounds exist for the warrant to issue. The Certificate of Analyst and the report from the analyst were admitted into evidence at trial. 3) The officer omitted a crucial ground for his belief. The officer did not depose that the driver of the vehicle was unconscious. The information toobtain did not constitute reasonable grounds for the belief that the accused had committed an offence under ss. 253. 4) The warrant to search for blood was invalid. 5) The information was not a reasonable grounds upon which the authorizing judge could be satisfied that the relevant statutory pre-conditions of s. 256 of the Code existed.  6) There was a relatively narrow basis for exclusion and the accused was found to have failed to communicate the basic information required of a warrant to be issued. The Court held that the information was insufficient to invalidate the warrant.,"The accused was charged with impaired care and control of a motor vehicle and care and control of a motor vehicle while his blood alcohol level exceeded .08. The accused was found in the driver's side of a vehicle with his legs near the pedals. His body was slumped over into the passenger side. The vehicle had collided with a power pole and sustained significant damage. The engine was running when the police arrived. There was no one else in the vehicle. The accused was transported to hospital where the doctor suspected he had a brain bleed and recommended the police obtain a blood warrant. The officer who swore the Information to Obtain the warrant indicated that the interior of the vehicle smelled strongly of beverage alcohol and the accused smelled of beverage alcohol. The Justice of the Peace did not sign the Information to Obtain. The issues before the Court were whether there had been a breach of the accused's s. 8 right to be free from unreasonable search and seizure and whether the Crown had proven beyond a reasonable doubt that the accused was in care and control of the motor vehicle. HELD: The blood warrant was found to be invalid, meaning that the blood samples were obtained as part of a warrantless search in breach of s. 8. The Information to Obtain the blood warrant did not depose that the officer believed the accused was the driver of the vehicle which had crashed into the power pole or that the accused was in care and control of the motor vehicle. The officer should have included information about the accused's position in the vehicle and that the accused was unconscious. Without this information, the Information to Obtain did not contain reasonable grounds to believe that the accused had committed an offence under s. 253 of the Criminal Code. However, the blood sample evidence was admitted after a s. 24(2) analysis. The Court held that the officer was acting in good faith and that he honestly held the belief that the accused was drinking and driving when he swore the Information to Obtain. The impact on the accused was technical in nature and did not seriously undermine the accused's rights. The Court held that the truth seeking function of the trial process would be better served by admission of the Certificate of Analysis. The Court found that the accused was in care and control of the motor vehicle at the time of the collision. There was no evidence that anyone else was in the vehicle and the position of the accused when discovered suggested he had been driving the vehicle. The accused was found guilty of driving while his blood alcohol level exceeded .08. The Court held that his blood alcohol level was between 236 mgs% and 283 mgs%."
"HELD: The Court granted the petitioner exclusive possession of the family home, primary residence of the children and supervised access only for the respondent father. Although no reasons were given on the granting of the interim exclusive possession order, the petitioner raised concerns that the respondent had anger management problems that made her and their children fearful of him and addictions to pornography and masturbation that made it impossible for them to continue to reside in the same home. The respondent took the position that the petitioner's allegations of sexual abuse were based upon speculation, conjecture, suspicion or unreliable testimony and evidence, which the Court could not reasonably attribute to the respondent. The Court found with respect to the totality of the evidence that: 1) the respondent was significantly involved in his children's lives, well beyond the level of many or most fathers who have normal work commitments; 2) the petitioner was entirely entitled to rebut the presumption that increased contact between the respondent and the children would in fact be beneficial. The evidence suggested that the relationship was one of the factors that led to the decision to impose a minimum supervision order; and 3) that, even if the petitioner had been diagnosed as a risk of harm, it was not in the children's best interests to restrict access to that parent by imposing a minimum supervised access order. The petitioner's grounds for so applying stated that the father had been unable to help but to masturbate in the presence of his children; and 4) that the children were unconsciously adopting their mother's view that she was the only person to put the children to bed. All of these factors justified the imposition of a minimum access order for the father.","HELD: The court found that both parties were significantly involved in the day-to-day parenting of the children such that a conclusion that one parent or the other was the primary caregiver could not be made. The court also found that the respondent responded positively and appropriately to the petitioner’s concerns regarding masturbation and pornography. The respondent indicated that he had not watched pornography since December 2014 and that software on his cell phone and computer provide assurances that he had not watched pornography to the petitioner. The petitioner did not dispute that evidence. The court could not reasonably give weight to the petitioner’s opinion evidence regarding the respondent’s alleged addictions. The court listed numerous problems with the petitioner’s evidence of addiction. The court was unable to conclude that there was a risk of harm to the children caused by the respondent. With respect to the petitioner’s allegation of the respondent’s anger management problem, most of the incidents were dated. The respondent had since taken anger management counselling, accepted that he suffers from ADD, and began taking medication for ADD. The court held that it was in the best interests of the children to continue to reside in the family home and that it would not be in their best interests for one parent to be classified as or be the primary parent. It was also in the children’s best interests that their parenting be shared on an equal basis. A nesting arrangement was found to be in the best interests of the children. The court ordered that the parties would have joint custody of the children and each party had exclusive possession of the family home when they were enjoying their assigned periods of parenting. The parents would alternate weeks living in the family home with the children."
"This was an appeal from a decision of the Family Court, which held that a lump sum payment made under the Family Maintenance Act could not be varied after payment. For the appellant and the respondent, that the lump sum payments were subject to variation under the Children of Unmarried Parents Act. The matter had been adjourned several times since the merger of the two courts, but the decision had been appealed. The parties were entitled to know as soon as possible what their decision would be.","This was an appeal of a decision which denied variation of a maintenance award where a lump sum had been previously ordered. The judge determined that since the respondent had paid the lump sum, his obligations were terminated; therefore, the Family Court did not have jurisdiction to hear the application. Allowing the appeal and returning the matter to the Family Court, that orders for child support made under the Family Maintenance Act do not have the finality which they did under other previous legislation. The order is always subject to variation in appropriate circumstances. Accordingly, the Family Court has jurisdiction to vary awards of lump sum child support made pursuant to the Family Maintenance Act."
"This was an application for an order varying the judgment of Dickson J. of the 5th of January 1990 in which he gave judgment for divorce and joint custody to the parents of two boys born April 22, 1984 and June 3, 1986. The mother had moved from Ontario to Saskatchewan with the intention of obtaining joint custody with principal residence with the father. The father applied to vary the judgment in order to have the children move out of Saskatchewan where they had lived since the divorce and into a new community with the mother. Counsel for the mother opposed the application on the grounds that it would result in the children uprooting from their home in Melfort and moving to a virtual paradise in Aurora. HELD: The application was granted. 1)The mother was granted reasonable access. 2)The father was granted generous access. 3)The move was not unreasonable. If the course he wishes to take is not offered atthe Dental College of the University of Saskatchewan the move would be in the best interests of the children. 4)The decision of the mother was made in good faith. 5)Costs were borne by the parties in the application.","The Mother applied to vary the custody provisions of the decree nisis for divorce which provided for joint custody of the parties' 2 children, aged 11 and 9 years. Under the existing order the children's primary residence was with their Father. A custody investigation conducted in 1990 when the mother had first commenced this application had recommended that the existing arrangement be continued. The Father now intended, however, to move with the children to Ontario to take additional education. HELD: Application dismissed. 1)The Judge found that the move to Ontario was a sufficient change of circumstances to permit a variation application to proceed. She therefore proceeded to consider if the move was in the best interests of the children. 2)The Judge reviewed recent authorities from across Canada dealing with whether a custodial parent should be permitted to move with the children. 3)In the circumstances of this case the Judge was convinced that the move was reasonable and was not motivated by any desire on the part of the Father to thwart the Mother's access."
FIAT. At the confirmation hearing the wife testified that she was receiving $880.00 per month in unemployment insurance and that subsequent to the provisional order the applicant received promotion at Safeway (September). HELD: 1)The Court was not satisfied that the court had accurate information as to the applicant's present income so as to be satisfied there was a substantial change in circumstance such as to warrant variation. 2)The court adjourned the confirmation hearings and remit the matter back for further information as as to their income.,On the confirmation hearing the Respondent testified that the Applicant was receiving unemployment insurance when the judgment for divorce and corollary relief were granted. Subsequent to the provisional order there was evidence that the applicant had received a promotion and may also have income as a musician. HELD: The confirmation hearing was adjourned and the matter was remitted back for further information. The court was not satisfied that it had accurate information as to the applicant's present income so as to warrant variation.
"FIAT. The mother sought to have ongoing child support of $180.00 per month per child for three children of the marriage increased. The father filed his last three income tax returns. The returns indicate that, after adjustments, he had an average gross taxable income of $28,000. However, the file also indicates that his net worth has increased substantially since the original order in 1993. HELD: The respondent's assets were not being reasonably utilized to generate income. In the circumstances it was appropriate for the respondent to impute income to the mother. The respondent was to pay the applicant $957.00 for the child support payable on the first day of each month as long as the children remained children of this marriage under the Divorce Act. There will be no order as to costs.","FIAT. The mother sought to have the ongoing child support of $180 per month per child for the three children of the marriage increased. The last three income tax returns of the father indicated an average gross income of $28,000 after adjustments. His net worth had increased substantially since the original order in 1993 from a net worth of $105,744 after deducting debts of $352,655 to $484,684 after deducting debts of $342,000. He purchased stock totalling $202,061 in 1996 using income generated from the farm. He claimed he could not work full time in the oil field because he was involved in a bison operation. HELD: The respondent was to pay monthly child support of $957 for as long as the children remained children as defined by the Divorce Act. It was appropriate to impute income of $56,000 as the respondent's assets were not being reasonably utilized to generate income."
"FIAT. The wife sought to vary the child support provisions of a judgment for divorce granted in September 1997 to an amount that complied with the Federal Child Support Guidelines. Pursuant to the terms of their 1995 divorce agreement, the respondent had custody of the children and the applicant had reasonable access on reasonable notice. The parties entered into an interspousal agreement in 1997 which required the applicant to pay child support in the amount of $700 per month for each child. The husband was on leave from his employment with the federal government and had requested a transfer to the province. He no longer enjoyed that income. HELD: A variation of the pre-judgment order was warranted based on the applicant's financial means and circumstances.  1)No special provision was contemplated by s17(6.2) of the Divorce Act given the change in thecircumstances of the applicant and the respondent. 2)The wife was to pay the respondent $975 per month in child and spousal support, continuing on the first day of each month until further order and $341 per month thereafter.  3)No order as to costs.","FIAT. The father sought to reduce the support contained in the 1997 divorce judgment which incorporated the parties' interspousal agreements regarding custody, access and child and spousal support. The parties were married in 1985 and separated in 1995. The mother was on leave from her employment. When his federal government management position was declared redundant, the applicant received a retiring allowance of $75,646 in May 1997. The respondent opposed the application on the basis there had been no change in circumstances since the judgment was granted; she had no other income than the support payments and child tax credit; alternatively, there were special provisions in the parties' separation agreement which would permit the court to award an amount that differs from the amount prescribed by the Guidelines.HELD: 1)The judgment the applicant sought to vary was made after the coming into force of the Guidelines. It did not however include a determination of child support made in accordance with the Guidelines. There was no change in the childrens' or mother's circumstances. The applicant was unemployed but was still benefiting from his retiring allowance at the time of the order which he no longer enjoyed. A variation was warranted as there had been a change in the father's financial means and circumstances. The Guideline support obligation for two children is $341 per month.  2)It could not be concluded on the evidence presented that there was any special provision in the parties' agreement that directly or indirectly benefited either child. The provision for child support in a specified amount greater than that provided in the Guidelines was not a 'special provision' as contemplated by s17(6.2) of the Divorce Act given the change in circumstances of the applicant whose annual income had dropped from $55,500 to $24,000 a year.  3)No order was made as to costs."
"Although custody was the most conspicuous issue in the proceeding, there were also questions of child support and division of matrimonial property that required resolution before the parties could put an end to their acrimonious marital breakdown. The father was unrepresented at trial. HELD: The tapes were admitted to their entirety and went in unedited.  1) Although the mother's recognition of past problems with depression and her progress in dealing with it through medication and counselling, the father was insistent that the tapes were of central importance to his case and that they discredited the conclusions of the custody and access report and demonstrated the abuse that was occurring in the mother’s home.  2) The tapes had the opposite effect of revealing the true character and motivations of the father and shedding little light on the mother. They spoke volumes about the father”s character, motivations, and psychological well-being and demonstrated his need to “grow up and realize the children are the biggest thing in his life”. 3) The father had no redeeming excuse for such calculated, offensive and immature behaviour. He had exploited the parents’ unhappiness at every turn and incited and encouraged willful and unruly behaviour to suit his own purposes. The parties’ hostility towards one another during the course of the relationship was palpable and it was difficult for the father to maintain a reasonable distance from his children. The evidence gathered by the mother was that the parties were in aprotracted pattern of dysfunctional, conflictual communication and that the father would always be there to rescue the children. Over time, the tapes became a source of frustration and anger for both parties. It was difficult to describe the tone and content of the tapes without lapsing into cynicism and disbelief.","Custody, child support and division of matrimonial property were in dispute. The mother was awarded interim custody of the three children in 1997. The father was ordered to pay child support of $405 per month but had made only one voluntary payment of $100. He agreed to abandon his appeal of the order for sale of the matrimonial home. He had been unable to obtain financing to buy out her share. The father, unrepresented by counsel, sought to have selected portions of 14 hours of taped telephone conversations with the children and wife admitted into evidence. He insisted the tapes were of central importance to his case; that they discredited the conclusions of the custody and access report and demonstrated abuse was occurring in the mother's home. HELD: 1)Sole custody was awarded to the mother. The father was to have access Friday from 5:00 p.m. until Tuesday at 9:00 every second weekend. 2)The tapes were admitted in their totality, unedited. The two lines of cases respecting the admission of audiotapes in a custody hearing were reviewed. The tapes had the opposite effect to the father's intent. The father 'alternatively interrogated the children about their mother; prompted them to make unfavourable comments about her; magnified every incident of childish squabbling into a crisis; magnified the children's distress over the marital breakdown, encouraged the children to run to his home at every opportunity; and generally undermined the mother's parental authority at every available turn.' The petitioner's depression had been ascribed to environmental stresses rather than innate. The father acknowledged that his drinking had lessened but not discontinued as he suggested in the custody and access report. 3)The property was to be sold. The father was responsible for mortgage payments from July 1998 until the date of sale as he had stopped making mortgage payments after the previous order while continuing to reside in the home. A corresponding adjustment in the net sale proceeds was to be made in the wife's favour. Child maintenance was to be satisfied from the father's share of the sale proceeds. 4)The mother's employment pension was to be divided equally and one half rolled into an RRSP designated by the father. RRSP's were to be divided equally. Furniture, furnishings and personal effects in their possession would be retained by each party. Hunting clothes or supplies and one half of the family photographs were to be returned to the father. The loan from the respondent's mother was statute-barred. No repayments had been made in 10 years. The debt for the half ton acquired after separation was the father's sole responsibility. 5)The prior order of $405 for child support remained in effect. The father made no income disclosure until trial and evidence of his 1991 income was unsatisfactory. Rental income was deemed to his 1998 income. No order was made for day care costs due to inadequate proof. The parties could seek a review if more comprehensive evidence were produced. 6)Judgment for divorce would be made final on the expiration of 31 days."
"The plaintiff practising lawyer commenced an action against the defendant in March 1999 for fees and disbursements in the amount of $4,647.85. On March 1999, Tapp obtained a garnishee summons issued prior to judgment against the said defendant and served it on Saskatchewan Property Management Corporation (""SPMC""). In April 1999, the plaintiff obtained default judgment against SPMC. In May 1999, he made an ex parte application for payment out of the moneys which had been paid into court by SPPC. On April 13, 1999, an application was made by SPSC on Q.B.G. 969 of 1999 for an order pursuant to Rules 411 and 415(1) of the Queen's Bench Rules of Court that the sum of $2,521.68 and any further amounts due and owing from SPMC to the defendant company be paid into Court and disposed of as the court may direct in full satisfaction of SPMCs obligations to the various parties who may have a claim against the money. Tapp served all of the various interested parties with the notice of motion and the matter was heard in Chambers on June 17, 1999. No one appeared on behalf of the other parties. At the time of the application, the Minister of Labour had not obtained judgment against any defendant company and there was no certificate of the Minister on file. This was later obtained and filed with the judicial centre at judicial centre of Regina on July 12, 1999 and was granted by Justice Wright together with costs of the Application to be taxed. Prior to the application for the payment out, the Director of Labour Standards directed that the application should be made by notice of a motion and that all parties interested in the funds should be served. The matter was reserved for decision on that date. HELD: 1)The application was dismissed according to the evidence.  2)The applicant was not entitled to a judgment for the third party claim as he had not entered into court with respect to potential wage claims owing by the defendants company to its employees pursuant to s.54 of the Labour Standards Act. 3)The third party's claim was proven by reason of the certificate issued by the Director in 1994 and was therefore dismissed. 4)The first two grounds of appeal were dismissed.","The plaintiff lawyer commenced an action for fees and disbursements in the amount of $4,647.85. The proposed garnishee, SPMC, paid $337.46 into court and brought an application for an order pursuant to Rules 411 and 415(1) of the Queen's Bench Rules of Court. An order that any further amounts due and owing from SPMC to the company be paid into court to be disposed as directed by the court was granted with taxed costs to SPMC. Labour Standards filed notice of potential wage claims. The plaintiff obtained default judgment and made an ex parte application for payment out of the monies paid into court by SPMC. HELD: The applicant/plaintiff was to be paid all monies paid into court by SPMC with respect to the two files together with accrued interest less the amount previously paid out. The claim by the Minister of Labour was dismissed. Although the monies paid into court according to the decision in Polyco Window Manufacturing Ltd v. Prudential Assurance Co create a fund from which creditors must be paid, the claim by the Minister of Labour as of the date of the application was not a proven claim. No certificate had been issued and no judgment had been entered as of that date. A judgment had been filed by the plaintiff. He was the only party entitled to the monies."
"The appellant appealed his conviction in Provincial Court on a charge of criminal harassment. The appellant alleged the trial judge erred by failing to properly review and re-review the evidence, in its entirely, with respect to the trial's findings on credibility, reasonable doubt and other key issues. He also alleged the judge had erred in his consideration of the evidence of reasonable doubt. Dismissing the appeal, that the trial court judge did not apply the wrong test in applying the curative provision in s.686(1)(a) of the Code. The appeal court judge's findings of credibility were not excluded from consideration.","The appellant appealed from his conviction on a charge of criminal harassment. He alleged that the verdict was unreasonable and not supported by the evidence. In addition, he claimed that the trial judge had erred in admitting as evidence an audiotape of a confrontation between the complainant and the appellant. The Summary Conviction Appeal Court judge dismissed the appeal. The appellant appealed. Dismissing the appeal, that the Summary Conviction Appeal Court judge did not err in the test which he applied in reviewing the trial decision, nor did he err in accepting the trial judge's decision to admit into evidence the audiotape."
"The parties were the natural parents of a son born in 1992 in Cape Dorset, Nunavut. In November 1999, the Court issued an order that it would take jurisdiction and hear the application under S. 18 of the Family Maintenance Act. The problem had been with translation services and obtaining a transcript. The mother had been very angry at the father and had taken him outside, placed him on the ground and punched him until friends intervened. This took some time to arrange and complete and during this period the child had remained in Nova Scotia. HELD: Custody was granted to the father. He had to spend considerable time with his father to retain ties with her and his Inuit culture. The paramount consideration of what is in the best interest of the child would require the Court to consider this as one of the factors to determine custody.","This was a hearing to determine the proper venue for a custody hearing. The parties resided together in 1991 and 1992 in the Territory of Nunavut. The first language of the respondent mother and the child is Inuktitut. The child, born in 1993, lived with the mother in Nunavut until 1999, when he moved to Nova Scotia to be with the father by agreement of both parties. This arrangement was not to exceed one year unless agreed to by the mother. Determining that the courts in both Nunavut and Nova Scotia have jurisdiction to deal with the issue of custody, that it was in the best interests of the child to remain in Nova Scotia and for the custody hearing to be held in Nova Scotia."
"The accused was charged with failing to comply with a demand to provide a sample of his breath by a peace officer pursuant to s. 254(2)(a) of the Criminal Code to enable proper analysis of my breath to be made by means of an approved screening device. The accused argued that he was not intentionally trying to avoid providing an adequate sample. He was attempting to supply sample as directed by the officer. HELD: The accused was found guilty. 1)The officer's lack of cander in giving his testimony in this regard has raised doubts in the mind as to his forthrightness in respect to other important details.  2)Where there is a discrepancy between the testimony of the officer and that of the accused, the court accept the evidence. The officer was properly instructed on what to do with the sample and the officer was reasonably instructed on how to provide the sample. 3)The mental element of the offence of refusal created by s.254(5) consists of intentional non-compliance.",The accused was charged with failure to provide forthwith a breath sample contrary to Criminal Code s.254(5). HELD: The accused was found not guilty. The court accepted the evidence of the accused where there was a discrepancy between the testimony of the officer and the accused. The mental element of the offence of refusal consists of intentional non-compliance. The officer in his conversation with another officer said he could not understand why he was not getting a proper sample. There was a reasonable doubt that the officer did understand why he was not getting a proper sample and could not provide the accused with adequate instructions.
"A cocaine fuelled encounter between the appellant and the woman with whom he was living resulted in his conviction for assault and sexual assault. He appealed the conviction submitting that it was unreasonable, was based on misapplication of the burden of proof and that the judge's reasons were so deficient as to constitute an error of law. HELD: The appeal was dismissed. There was ample evidence which, if believed, justified the conviction. The judge applied the proper test and did not apply his or her mind to the possibility that despite having rejected the appellant's evidence, there might nevertheless be a reasonable doubt about guilt. The court applied the correct standard of proof to the whole of the evidence.","The appellant was convicted of sexual assault, with the only live issue at trial being whether the Crown had proved the absence of the complainant's consent beyond a reasonable doubt. Appeal dismissed; the judge's reasons disclosed that he applied the reasonable doubt standard to the evidence as a whole; although the reasons for judgment were very brief and open to criticism, they did not preclude meaningful appellate review. The test for legal error in a judge alone case is not the same as would apply to a judge's charge to a jury on the issue of reasonable doubt. It was not an error for the judge to assess the credibility of the appellant in relation to that of the complainant as long as he went on to take the next step, as he did in his 'short-hand reference' to the evidence."
"Fulltext of judgment follows:[1] There will be an order pursuant to s. 680 of the Criminal Code directing a review by the Court of Appeal of the decision in this matter made by Gerein C.J.Q.B. on May 7, 2004. The Registrar will fix a time and date suitable to the Court and counsel.","Fulltext of judgment follows: [1] There will be an order pursuant to s. 680 of the Criminal Code directing a review by the Court of Appeal of the decision in this matter made by Gerein C.J.Q.B. on May 7, 2004. [2] The Registrar will fix a time and date suitable to the Court and counsel. DATED at the City of Regina, in the Province of Saskatchewan, this 21st day of May, A.D. 2004."
"The parties were married for four years and had purchased a home in Nova Scotia. The husband sought a more favourable division of assets and an entitlement to health insurance. The wife, who was a self-represented litigant at trial, sought to introduce fresh evidence. The trial judge found no palpable or overriding error in the manner in which the judge calculated the value of the assets retained by the wife and the amount owed to the husband from the sale of the Chicago property. The judge also found no major errors in the accounting standard. The evidence was readily available at trial and was irrelevant or both.","The parties separated shortly after relocating from the United States to Nova Scotia. As part of the divorce, the Supreme Court ordered a division of assets. Both parties appealed the asset division; in the process, both parties sought to introduce fresh evidence. The wife also questioned the level of assistance offered by the trial judge to the husband who was self-represented at trial. Appeal and cross-appeal dismissed with the exception that the wife is to be given immediate access to her personal belongings; both applications to introduce fresh evidence dismissed; on the sparse record before him, the trial judge did not err in his division of assets and did not offer the husband unwarranted assistance as a self- represented litigant. Faced with two competing claims as to the amount of the proceeds of sale, if any, of one of the parties' properties, the trial judge committed no error in finding the amount owed to be half-way between the two claims and then setting it off against the amount owed to the other party."
"The plaintiff entered into a contract with the defendant to provide banking, blending and lifting of coal at its coal preparation plant. The defendant was the successful bidder. The plaintiff sued for loss of profits, damage to the plaintiff's equipment and breach of contract claim. Awarding the defendant $270,307.05 in damages, that the defendant erred in finding that it was in breach of the contract and in holding it was not entitled to rely on the exclusion from liability provisions in the contract. Further, the defendant cross-appealed, claiming damages for negligent misstatement. It was also found that the plaintiff did not provide the approximate tonnages as required by the contract, and thus there was no loss of profit arising as a result of the defendant's termination.","The defendant obtained a tender to bank, blend and load coal at the plaintiff's coal preparation plant. In performing the contract, the defendant experienced equipment problems resulting in the plaintiff having to rent other equipment. The plaintiff terminated the contract without any prior warning or notice to the defendant and brought an action for reimbursement of monies advanced under the contract and expenses incurred for the equipment rentals. The defendant counter-claimed for damages arising out of the termination of the contract, for services performed under the contract and for extras which had not been paid. The court found that the plaintiff was entitled to reimbursement for overpayments and equipment rentals and that the defendant was entitled to fair and reasonable compensation for extras for which the court awarded the sum of $10,000. Both parties were found to be in breach of the contract, the plaintiff's breach occurring because the volumes of coal supplied did not approximate the tonnages represented in the contractual documents. The clause excluding liability for errors in the forecast did not excuse the plaintiff because the actual volumes were not even approximate to the forecasted tonnages and the rates bid by the defendant were directly related to the anticipated tonnages. Absent evidence as to how the plaintiff arrived at the information used in the calculation of the forecasted tonnages, no negligent misrepresentation could be found, as there was no evidence that the information was negligently obtained. Both parties appealed. Appeal and cross-appeal dismissed; the trial judge's finding that the defendant had fundamentally breached its contractual obligations which entitled the plaintiff to terminate the contract without notice should not be disturbed; thus, the trial judge did not err in awarding the plaintiff damages for the defendant's breach of contract. The defendant did not establish that the plaintiff had been negligent in making the tonnage estimates and thus, the judge did not err in dismissing the defendant's claim for negligent misrepresentation. Although the trial judge found that the plaintiff had also committed a fundamental breach of the contract (in failing to provide the approximate tonnages referred to in the contract), the defendant had not chosen to terminate the contract and the plaintiff's breach did not undermine its right to terminate the contract as a result of the defendant's breach."
"The plaintiff brought an application to strike pleadings and for summary judgment upon the court concluding that mere intentions, negotiations, etc., and pleadings of a cause of action failed to create a cause for action. The defendant applied to strike the pleadings, for summary judgement, and for costs and disbursements. The originating notice action was filed July 21, 2003 and therefore the new tariff of September 29, 2004 does not apply. In many applications where the results bring finality the court has utilized Tariff A. The solicitor and client fees to the date of the hearing were approximately $2,000,000 was not, in the court's view, the appropriate amount involved. The hearing was less than 2 hours in duration however, there were a number of steps taken prior to the application including filing a list of documents, exchange of documents and apparently two days of discovery. In the circumstances, a reasonable and fit party and party level of costs is $5,000 plus disbursement of $510.97 and the defendant is entitled to judgment for costs taxed and allowed in the amount of $5 million.","The court granted the defendant's application for summary judgment of claim. Costs were at issue. Costs awarded in the amount of $5,000 plus disbursements; although the hearing was less than 2 hours in length, there were a number of steps taken prior to the application, including two days of discovery examination."
"The plaintiff sought wages that she would have earned had she worked to the end of the term of her employment. The defendant advertised for two positions in the local newspaper. The advertised position for a receptionist had been advertised but had not been delivered. The plaintiff claimed that the job advertised for a'summer student' with a minor in history and that she had been negligent in not processing certain documents. HELD: The plaintiff was dismissed without just cause. 1)It was well established law that section 43 of the Act provides a minimum notice period and does not prevent an employee from seeking remedy at a common law for breach of contract. 2)The plaintiff was awarded damages in the amount of $2,083.73. Certificate of judgment would issue in her favour in that amount and for costs of $20. 3)In the circumstances it can not be said that it is more probable than not that the plaintiff was guilty of serious misconduct or a breach of such a fundamental nature respecting office policies - policies that may not have been made known to her, that there was just cause for her dismissal.","The plaintiff student argues that she was unjustly dismissed and so sues the defendant business for wages that she would have earned had she worked to the end of the term of her employment. The employer argues that the plaintiff was dismissed for cause. HELD: 1) The employer spoke to the employee on three occasions about her work and by his own admission, the employee made an effort to improve. At no time was she advised in any detail what was expected of her and that a failure to meet a particular standard could result in the termination of her employment. It would appear that the employer attributed the misfiling of a paper in an income tax return to the plaintiff and he decided to summarily dismiss her. In the circumstance, it can not be said that it is more probable than not that the plaintiff was guilty of serious misconduct or a breach of a fundamental nature respecting office policies, policies that may not have been made known to her, that there was just cause for her dismissal. Therefore the defendant was dismissed without just cause.  2) The contract of employment was a term contract extending from May to August 31, 2004. The plaintiff was dismissed on July 12. But for her dismissal, she would have worked for the rest of July and for the month of August or 36 days. 3) In this case the plaintiff made reasonable effort to seek and maintain employment. She earned $657.83. 4) The plaintiff is awarded judgment in the amount of $2,083.73."
"The plaintiff alleged the defendant has injured his reputation and feelings, and caused him humiliation, distress, and humiliation through her actions as Reeve of the Rural Municipality of Sherwood. The plaintiff claims general and aggravated damages of $5,000 for these injuries. HELD: 1) The restriction placed on the plaintiff by the defendant was not in her personal capacity and she was free to discuss municipal issues with the ratepayers in his division and within the municipality and with the media and others. 2) The Court was not prepared to award damages to the plaintiff and thus enable him to gain a personal benefit from a limitation which only had a small effect on his right to represent his constituents. 3) The dispute was a political one and a court should be reluctant to get involved. 4) The defendant was acting on the advice of legal counsel when imposing sanctions upon the plaintiff that she had not breached the standard of care. 5) The plaintiff failed to establish that the defendant acted with knowledge she had no legal authority to do what she did in imposing sanctions on her. The Court dismissed the action.","The plaintiff alleges the defendant has injured his reputation and feelings, and has caused the plaintiff humiliation and distress, through her actions as Reeve of the Council of the Rural Municipality of Sherwood. The plaintiff claims general and aggravated damages of $5,000 for these injuries. Both the plaintiff and the defendant were elected to their positions. The plaintiff is a councillor. The defendant determined that the plaintiff was in a conflict of interest and asked the plaintiff to remove himself from the Chambers pursuant to s. 45(1) of The Rural Municipality Act. There was a further determination by the defendant that the plaintiff had misrepresented his situation to the council. The defendant then prepared a letter to the plaintiff in which she advised that until such time as he apologized to council and remedied the 'deficiencies' that created the conflict of interest he would not be recognized by the chair to speak or to move motions. HELD: The claim is dismissed. 1) Even if the defendant's decision did infringe on the plaintiff's Charter right to expression to some limited extent and could not be upheld pursuant to the section of The Rural Municipality Act (the Court made no conclusions as to which of the competing legal opinions is right) the Court was not prepared to award damages to the plaintiff pursuant to s. 24(1) of the Charter. While the plaintiff's decision might have been politically advantageous to her and her supporters in council, it was not without some justification because the plaintiff was in breach of the Building Bylaw, there could be a perceived conflict of interest, and the Reeve did have some evidence before her that the plaintiff had misrepresented his situation to council. The Court was not prepared to award damages to the plaintiff so he could gain a personal benefit from a limitation which only had a small effect on his right to represent his constituents. The dispute between the parties is a political one. A court should be reluctant to get involved. 2) With regard to the tort of misfeance in public office, even if the defendant acted without lawful authority in imposing the sanctions in order to be actionable, the defendant had to be aware that her conduct was unlawful. This requirement has not been met. The defendant was acting on legal advice from legal counsel to the municipality. There is no evidence, nor even the suggestion, that legal counsel did not act in good faith in providing advice to the defendant. As a result, the plaintiff has failed to establish that the defendant acted with knowledge she had no legal authority to do what she did in imposing sanctions on the plaintiff. 3) With respect to the tort of negligence, the Court found that because the defendant was acting on the advice of legal counsel when imposing the sanctions upon the plaintiff, she has not breached the standard of care. Her actions were not negligent."
"FIAT: Wal-Mart is seeking an order pursuant to Queen's Bench Rule 664 and Rule 673 prohibiting the Saskatchewan Labour Relations Board as presently constituted from hearing and/or making any orders involving it or until further order of this Honourable Court. The application of the Union seeks an order striking and removing virtually all of the material filed in support of the application. In the other motion, the union applies for an order dismissing the application by the applicant. HELD: The relief sought by the Union should be granted and the application brought by the employer should be dismissed. Although there is no admissible evidence before the court, believe my account is accurate. The affidavits of the members of the Board and the union are admissible. There is no necessity for their admission. The applicant must be available to swear an affidavit. The critical allegations originate with him. Absent any explanation for his absence, there was no basis upon which to conclude that it is necessary to accept the proferred documents as evidence. Reliability presents an equal problem. Since everything attributed to the Matkowski family has an aura of self-interest, it does not generate confidence in its reliability. At no time have the allegations been tested for accuracy and truthfulness. In reality, contradictions are found within the very documents. The affidavit of one Walter Matkowski, a former vice-chairperson of the SRLB, who maintains this came about through the influence of certain unions with the Department of Labour, in consequence, he commenced an action for damages alleging wrongful conduct by the Government of Saskatchewan. He also participated in an interview in which he suggested that the Department interfered with the operation of the board. In other words, the critical allegations originating with the Matkowski family were critical and disparaging of the retailer. When the store became aware of these circumstances it filed this Affidavit. It is argued that the actions of the Unions, the interference by the government and the presence of certain publications demonstrate that the Saskatchewan LRB is biased or, at the very least, there is a reasonable apprehension of bias against Wal-mart. The Court would be acting on pure conjecture or fantasy.","FIAT: The former vice-president of the Saskatchewan Labour Relations Board commenced an action for damages alleging wrongful conduct by the Government of Saskatchewan. He alleges his term was not renewed through the influence of certain unions with the Department of Labour. He participated in an interview where he suggested that the Department of Labour required members of the Board to read the newsletter of the Saskatchewan Federation of Labour. When Wal-Mart became aware of these circumstances, it filed this application. Wal-Mart alleges the Board is biased or, at the very least, there is justification for a reasonable apprehension of bias against Wal- Mart. It argues that the only way to rectify the situation is to prohibit the Board from holding hearings involving Wal-Mart. The Union applies pursuant to Rule 319 of the Queen's Bench Rules to strike almost all the material filed by Wal-Mart. HELD: The application of Wal-Mart is dismissed. The Union will have taxable costs, but only of the application by Wal-Mart and the Union's application to strike the material filed.  1) The affidavit filed by Wal-Mart swears that the affiant has 'personal knowledge of the facts and matters herein deposed to' and then he goes on to swear that various exhibits are attached to his affidavit. This achieves nothing more than compel the court to examine the exhibits to determine their admissibility. The affiant does nothing more than provide copies of 27 documents. 2) There is no necessity for the admission of the documents. There is no basis upon which to conclude that it is necessary to accept the proffered documents as evidence.  3) It is alleged there was interference with the Board and that it was required to read publications which were highly disparaging of Wal-Mart. Yet there is absolutely no evidence before the court to prove the allegations. Many newsletters contain negative comments about Wal-Mart. However, there is no admissible evidence to prove that these newsletters were provided to the Board, or that any member actually read them. Mr. Matkowski has not come forward to assert his allegations under oath. Without such evidence, it is impossible to conclude that bias exists within the Saskatchewan Labour Relations Board or that there is justification for a reasonable apprehension of bias. To conclude otherwise, this court would be acting on pure conjecture or fantasy. That is not good enough."
"The appellants sought leave to amend their notice of appeal. Leave was required because the underlying proceeding was an application for leave to appeal and, if granted, an appeal from an order requiring the appellants to post security for costs with respect to certain interlocutory applications in which they will be the moving parties. The application was opposed by the respondent 2301072 Nova Scotia Limited and the intervenor 2301042 Dominion Bank. HELD: Leave to amend was granted. The amendment was reasonably necessary for the presentation of the appeal and will not occasion prejudice in the sense which is relevant to this application. The amendments will not interfere with the date set for filing the appeal book or result in any wasted effort to address the appeal as originally framed. As for prejudice, the application must be on the question of whether there is any prejudice to the respondent or intervenor as a result of the appellant raising this issue now by way of amendment rather than in the original notice. There is no suggestion of any prejudice in that sense resulting from the amendment.","The appellants applied for leave to amend their notice of appeal in regard to an order requiring them to post security for costs with respect to certain interlocutory applications. The application was opposed, inter alia, on the basis that the allegations which underlie the proposed amendment were not justiciable issues before the trial judge, were irrelevant on the application and were not ruled on by the trial judge. Application to amend the notice of appeal allowed; the amendment is reasonably necessary for the presentation of the appeal and will not occasion prejudice to the respondent. The respondent's opposition to the application fundamentally misconceived the role of a chambers judge who is asked to grant leave to amend a notice of appeal. It is not the role of a chambers judge to rule on the substantive merits of the arguments the appellants wish to make. The focus in this situation is on whether there is any prejudice to the respondent as a result of this issue being raised by amendment rather than in the original notice of appeal."
"The Bankrupt, who had outstanding student loans of about $39,000, applied for relief under s. 178(1.1) of the Bankruptcy and Insolvency Act. She had applied for interest relief in the amount of $2,000.00. Although she had good income, it would still take several years to discharge the loans without prejudicing the reasonable frugal lifestyle she and her family enjoy. To expect them to pay in a shorter period would be a continuation of financial difficulty which prevented her from paying the loans. Any period longer would be too long. It would also protract the burden of these loans in a manner inconsistent with the overall objectives of the BIA.","The bankrupt, who had outstanding student loans of approximately $39,000, applied for relief under s. 178(1.1) of the Bankruptcy and Insolvency Act. She had completed her studies to become a teacher 13 years ago and had erroneously been advised that a consumer proposal would discharge these loans. Although both she and her husband had good incomes, it would still take several more years to discharge the loans without prejudicing her family's reasonably frugal lifestyle. Relief granted; to require the bankrupt to discharge the loans in a reasonable manner would require an additional 10 or more years on top of the 13 years with which she had already been burdened, and to expect her to pay in a shorter period would cause her continuing financial difficulties. The bankrupt had acted in good faith and had been unable to service the loans in the early years when she did not have permanent employment. Compromising the debt and requiring her to only pay half of it was not an available option."
"The accused’s stepmother called him early in the morning with the news that there had been a police raid on the home she shared with the accused. The police found two guns, a sawed off shotgun, a Lakefield Mark II rifle and ammunition, in a careless manner. The intercepts were also of significant importance to the firearms trafficking charges. The accused was charged with possession of firearms and ammunition contrary to s. 8 and s. 9 of the Criminal Code. At issue was whether the accused had constructive and/or joint possession of the firearms. HELD: 1)The accused was presumed to be innocent until the Crown proved he was guilty beyond a reasonable doubt. 2)The evidence collected from the accused was that the sawed-off shotgun and ammunition were found in a box in the master bedroom of their home.  3)Evidence collected through various case management conferences and the assistance of the Canada Firearms Centre had not been dispensed with.  4)Although evidence collected at the scene of the search had been considered at trial, it was not accepted that the accused could assert a privacy interest in order to obtain protection of s.8 of the Charter and then, when that application went badly and the evidence is admitted, turn around and claim to be a stranger to the item in which the privacy interest resided. 5)There was nothing to suggest that the guns and ammunition introduced as evidence in this trial were not the ones that were located in the other two individuals’ home. The evidence collected through the course of the trial was that of a witness. The witness’ testimony did not meet the burden of proof and there was no suggestion of a continuity problem.  6)Evidence obtained through the destruction of the evidence and the exchange of photographs between the parties was not considered relevant to the charges. 7)Statutes of the Custody and Interpretation of the Evidence and the Access to Information Act were not to be relied upon. The Crown and the accused were jointly responsible for the search of the premises. 8)The Crown had not established that the contents of the three guns seized were a prohibited device within s. 84(1) of the Code and a section of Part II of the Regulations. 9)Countries were not required to accept the evidence of the persons who possessed the firearms at the time of their arrest. 10)Counts were not issued pursuant to the Part VI authorization.  11)The essential issue on the firearms seized from the victims was whether Kyle had constructive possession of them.  12)","The accused was charged with numerous weapons-related offences, including possession and trafficking. The police had intercepted numerous ambiguous calls between the accused and others and had interpreted the coded language used as involving discussions about firearms. The defence had been unsuccessful in arguing that the inferences drawn were mere hunches and the conversations could not support a reasonable inference that the subjects under discussion were firearms. A search at his parents' residence had resulted in the seizure of several firearms but none were found in the accused's actual possession. One of the issues was whether the accused had constructive or joint possession of the firearms seized from his parents. Accused found guilty on all the weapons' possession charges and some of the trafficking charges, but not guilty of careless storage of a firearm. It was clear that the accused had much more than a passive or quiescent knowledge of the guns seized from his parents' home and there were a number of indicators that he had a measure of control over them, such as his telling his father on occasion to get rid of them, his being notified immediately when one of the firearms went missing, the way he pressed his parents to explain how that could happen and his ability on other occasions to tell his father where in the home a particular firearm was located. However, despite his knowledge of the location of some of the firearms at certain times, the court was unable to find that the accused had stored the firearms in the manner they were found when the search warrant was executed. The evidence also established that he was stashing guns at locations other than his residence and he possessed those guns for the purpose of transferring them to others. The only reasonable inference to be drawn from the intercepts was that the speakers were talking about guns and the communications revealed the commercial nature of the accused's activities. Given that the accused had asserted a privacy interest with respect to an application to exclude the evidence arising from the police search of the cell phone seized from him, he could not now deny that the phone was his."
"The defendant entered into a contract with the plaintiff for seeding 1,050 acres. The plaintiff refused to allow the defendant's lawyer to refer to exhibit P-5 of the contract, arguing that it was not a matter raised or dealt with by the appeal judge. The defendant sued for the price of the custom seed and sought leave to appeal. HELD: Leave to appeal was denied. 1)Leave to appeal should not be granted to the defendant. The court reviewed the transcript of the trial judge's cross-examination of the plaintiff and found that it did not relate to an error in the law. 2)The trial judge made no error in weighing the central issue of law with respect to the issue of costs. The central issue was whether the plaintiff could have seeded all but 70-100 acres of the tract of land shown in the contract plus the balance of the Knudsen property. 3)Leave was granted to appeal on the principle that the Small Claims Act may not be invoked on a question of law basis. 4)Leave must not be obtained in the interest of expediency.",The court denied leave to appeal. The applicant’s proposed grounds of appeal were not questions of law but of fact.
"FIAT: The applicants ask the Court to remove the respondent as executor of the estate. They seek a revocation of the grant of probate and an order that the Will be proven in solemn form and related relief. HELD: 1) The respondent is removed as an executor pursuant to the Grant of Probate ordered by Gabrielson J. in July 2016. His grounds are that he has brought an application that effectively challenges the validity of the Will, the Will and the testator's signature. 2) There is no evidence that either of the parties has acted contrary to their obligations to administer the estate in accordance with the directions contained in the Will.  3) The Court has the jurisdiction to remove a person of the deceased's will, both pursuant to its inherent jurisdiction and pursuant to s. 17 of The Administration of Estates Act, SS 1998, A-4.1 [Act]. With respect to the applicants' application, the Court ordered that the respondent be removed from the job. The direction for the respondent to take no steps to distribute assets in the estate until after February 15, 2018 was extended to allow them an opportunity to bring their application back.",HELD: The application was granted. The court ordered the removal of the respondent as an executor in the grant of probate and ordered that the applicants remain as executors but that they should take no further steps to distribute the assets of the estate. It found that there were “special circumstances” within the meaning of s. 17 of The Administration of Estates Act. The respondent was entitled to challenge the validity of the will but not entitled to remain as an executor.
"This was an action for wrongful dismissal. The plaintiff was assigned to work for the defendant company as an expatriate. He received a salary of $60,000. In return, the defendant offered him a position as a senior geophysicist. The position was based on a contract between the parties that required the plaintiff to give 30 days notice of termination if the company desired to terminate the contract. The defendant refused, and the plaintiff went into deep depression. He underwent treatment for several years and then quit work. He claimed that he could leave the company on three months notice. He alleged that this clause did not refer to termination of his employment by the defendant but rather to a period of time when the contract would terminate. Awarding the plaintiff $500.00 in salary and benefits, that the 30 day notice provision in the contract did not abrogate the doctrine of law that reasonable notice must be given.","In a contract of employment, which involved an agreement changing the plaintiff from 'expatriate' to 'local' status, a termination clause providing that the agreement could be terminated upon 3 months' notice was held to be inadequate language to abrogate the implied term of reasonable notice. The plaintiff had correctly interpreted the clause as relating to the termination of the agreement, not of his employment. The agreement provided that it was governed by the laws of the province of Alberta. The plaintiff had been employed by the defendant for 12 years and was awarded compensation in an amount equivalent to 18 months notice less the three months pay he already received and any income from his new employment over the balance of the 15 months. He was also awarded the loss resulting from the difference in vacation and loss of an auto allowance for the 15 months. For emotional trauma, which lasted only briefly, he received $500."
"This was an appeal from an assessment of damages in a wrongful dismissal action brought against Saskatchewan Transportation Company (STC). The plaintiff was the former president and chief executive officer of the provincial Crown corporation.STC awarded damages against the corporation in the basic amount of $165,000. For the most part we can find no tenable basis for concluding that the award of damages was inordinately high. The trial judge assessed the damages on the general principles, that the object of these awards is to compensate for the loss of income sustained in consequence of the wrongful dismissal; second, that their measure is prima facie the amount that would have been earned had the employment continued subject to deduction of such amounts as might have occurred in light of the duty upon persons suffering losses to keep them to minimum; and third, that all of the plaintiff's Crown corporation service should have been calculated on the premise his annual salary was $102,000 rather than $110,000 less. The plaintiff resisted the attribution on pragmatic grounds arguing that the company had not paid any salary, that there was no guarantee the company was going to earn profit, that it needed working capital, and that it was mere fledging.","On appeal from 106 SaskR 277. 47 year old respondent, former President and Chief Executive Officer of STC, had been awarded $165,000 (18 months) for wrongful dismissal. He had successively served three Crown Corporations over a period of ten years. On appeal held the award of damages was not inordinately high. The court however reduced the damages by $16,500 as it disagreed with the trial judge's determination regarding mitigation of damages. Appeal allowed to the extent of reducing the damages from $165,000 to $148,500."
"The appellant was convicted of two counts of indecent assault following a dispute in a trailer where the two young complainants were living with their mother. He denied assaulting the complainants and sentenced him to 9 months in prison followed by 2 years probation. He appealed the convictions on the grounds of credibility. The trial judge carefully considered the evidence of the witnesses including the contradictions in the testimony. After carefully reviewing the evidence, they concluded that the verdict was not unreasonable or not supported by the evidence and the appeal was dismissed.","The appellant was convicted of indecent assault against two young girls. He appealed on five grounds related to a substantial conflict in the evidence. Dismissing the appeal, that there was no error on the part of the trial judge in weighing the evidence."
"This was an appeal from a decision of the trial judge arising out of an interpleader application by the respondent Band to determine which of several parties was entitled to be paid a sum of money owing by the Band under a construction contract entered into by the Respondent with the respondent Francis for the construction of residential homes on the Shubenacadie Reserve. The Respondent had made a number of assignments of book debts, some general and some specified to the various claimants. The respondent had made several assignments to entities other than the Indian Band under the construction contract. In one of these assignments, Francis assigned to the respondent the sum of $101,636.33 to be held at the Council Office in trust. The Chambers judge found that s. 89(1) of the Indian Act was applicable and ordered that the sum be paid to the Eskasoni Band. Another appellant appealed. Allowing the appeal, that the Chambers judge erred in his interpretation of s.89(1). The Act does not either expressly or impliedly confer any greater right upon an assignee of a chose in action that he had before. When an Indian is in business he holds and deals with his or her business property in the commercial mainstream on terms no different than those applicable to all other Canadians. The protection afforded by s.(1)of the Act was limited to the amount owing to Francis from the time of registration.","This was an appeal from a Supreme Court decision on an interpleader application by the respondent Shubenacadie Band to determine which of several parties was entitled to be paid a sum of money owed by the Band to the respondent Francis, an Indian residing on the Eskasoni Reserve in Cape Breton, for the construction of residential homes on the Shubenacadie Reserve. Francis had made a number of assignments of book debts, some general and some specific, to the various claimants. The trial judge concluded that he was bound by s.89(1) of the Indian Act, which holds that the real and personal property of an Indian or a band situated on a reserve is not subject to charge, pledge, mortgage, attachment, levy, seizure, distress or execution in favour of or at the instance of any person other than an Indian or a band. He concluded that the money owed Francis by the Shubenacadie band was the property of an Indian on a reserve, and that assignment of book debts, both general and specific, were included within the meaning of s.89(1). He found that the respondent Eskasoni Band was the only Indian entity among the several claimants and ordered the money paid to them. The appellants appealed. Allowing the appeal on the issue of the Indian Act, that s.89(1) does not prevent an Indian from assigning book debts of his construction business to secure business loans. When Indians are in business they hold and deal with their business property in the commercial mainstream on terms no different than those applicable to all Canadians. Nevertheless, the Eskasoni Band is still entitled to the money owed to Francis by reason of having obtained the first general assignment of book debts from him and having registered it prior to Francis making further assignments. The registration of a general assignment of book debts is constructive notice of the assignment to subsequent assignees falling within the provisions of s.3 of the Assignment of Book Debts Act."
"FIAT. The applicant sought an order pursuant to s.87 and s. 251 of the Land Titles Act, cancelling the existing Certificate of Title in the name of the respondent and herself as joint tenants and directing the Registrar to issue a new title in their joint names with right of survivorship. The sellers were not represented by legal counsel. They prepared a transfer of the property and sent it to the Land Tittles Office for registration. On August 20, 1997, a mortgage was registered by the lawyer on August 21, 1997. The error describing the purchasers on the title went unnoticed by the owner. The lawyer acknowledged that it was a mistake that the title issued as it did and that the mistake was not noticed by him when he reviewed the documents. HELD: The application was dismissed. 1)The respondent was entitled to an order directing the registrar to cancel the existing title and to issue new one in his name. 2)The applicant had an alternate remedy. Not a remedy that would correct the mistake but could provide compensation in the form of damages from the lawyer for any loss suffered as a result of the mistake. Damages in the circumstances were not a reasonably convenient remedy or procedure for giving relief. The title would remain registered in the names of strangers, neither of whom could be compelled to sell to the other.","FIAT. The applicant sought an order pursuant to s.87 and s.251 of the Land Titles Act cancelling the existing certificate of Title in the names of the deceased and herself as tenants in common and directing the Land Titles Registrar to issue a new title in their joint names with right of survivorship. The deceased and applicant who had been living together purchased residential property in 1997. Their lawyer prepared a written agreement for the sellers and purchasers as well as the mortgage describing the purchasers as joint tenants. The sellers, unrepresented by legal counsel, prepared the transfer of the property and title issued without the words 'joint tenants'. The error describing the purchasers went unnoticed by their lawyer. The respondent had been married to the deceased when he died intestate in 1998. As the title stood an undivided one-half interest was owned by the estate and would devolve to the respondent pursuant to the Intestate Succession Act. HELD: The Land Titles Office Registrar was to amend the existing certificate of title by inserting 'joint tenants' after the names of the registered owners. 1)The requirements set out in Bank of Nova Scotia v. Rochon were satisfied. There was an obvious mistake which required rectification. The deceased and the applicant intended to purchase the property as joint tenants and instructed their lawyer accordingly. The lawyer acknowledged that it was a mistake that the title issued as it did. 2)Although the applicant had an alternate remedy of seeking damages for any loss from her conveyance lawyer, damages were not a reasonably convenient remedy in this case as title would remain registered in the names of strangers, neither of whom could be compelled to sell to the other."
"The accused, who lived with his parents and siblings on a First Nation First Nation, was charged with second degree murder and armed robbery. The accused was released on conditions including his being confined to his residence and having written permission from the IPSEM Co-ordinator or his designate to be absent from his residence for two outstanding charges arising out of a house party in October 1999. At issue was his release on the ground that his detention was necessary to maintain confidence in the administration of justice. HELD: The accused's release was not necessary for the protection or safety of the public. Generally bail is denied only for those whopose a substantial likelihood of committing an offence or interfering with justice. There was no evidence that the accused poses a grave danger to the administration.","The 18 year old, charged with the second degree murder of two individuals, applied for release from custody. HELD: The accused was released on his own undertakings under a set of strict conditions, including participation in an electronic monitoring program. The onus is on the accused to show cause why his detention in custody is not justified. Criminal Code s.515(10) now permits detention on three grounds. His detention was not necessary to ensure his attendance at court nor for the protection or safety of the public. There was no evidence he posed a substantial likelihood of committing further offences or that he would interfere with the administration of justice if released. There was no other just cause, including maintenance of confidence in the administration of justice."
"The applicant Credit Union loaned the respondent $37,700 upon a security of a 1999 Chevrolet Blazer. The respondent's wife had apparently been the person who used the vehicle under the registration certificate and who had made payments on it under the original purchase agreement. Prior to the expiry of the registration the Credit Union made the respondent aware of their claim and of their intent to realize upon their security. The vehicle was not sold or charged in favour of a third party during the period September 11, 2001, to November 14, 2001 when the security interest was unperfected. The wife sought to defeat the security on the ground that she was at all times the real owner of the vehicle, had made the payments and was always in possession of the car. HELD: The claim of the Credit union was enforceable as against the conflicting claim of Ms. Clayton. 1)The evidence of ownership is important but not the principal determinant of ownership. The Bank of Montreal case was one of several that dealt with the use of a title registry in Saskatchewan other than that maintained by SGI. 2)The claim of a Credit Union was enforceABLE. The claim was not enforceable in the special circumstances of this matter.  3)The applicant had transferred ownership from her husband's estate to her name and all other indicia of ownership were in her favour. 4)The Credit Union claim was enforceably enforceable. The transfer would only serve the purpose of defeating the Creditunion's claim if it were undertaken for value and without notice, which was not the case here.","The Credit Union loaned $37,700 upon security, inter alia, of a 1999 Chevrolet Blazer owned by McMillan. A security agreement was registered at the Personal Property Security Registry in September 2000 and re-registered in November 2001. After McMillan died in June 2001, payments fell into arrears and a demand was made for possession of the Blazer. His widow, the respondent, was shown as co-buyer on the purchase agreement but was never the registered owner until she acquired it from her husband's estate. She sought to defeat the security interest on the grounds she was the real owner at all times, made the payments and was always in possession. At issue was whether the registered owner of a vehicle has the power to grant a security interest enforceable in priority to the interest of a person whose claim, though substantial, is not registered or otherwise of record in any place where the lender has or should have notice of it. HELD: The claim of the Credit Union was enforceable. Judicial notice was taken of the fact there is no title registry in Saskatchewan other than that maintained by Saskatchewan Government Insurance. The licensing function was assigned to SGI under the Vehicle Administration Act. That Act and the Highway Traffic Act are clear the person named in a registration certificate is regarded as the owner of the vehicle. Motor vehicles are unique in that their registration creates a presumption of ownership and follows a declaration of ownership by the registry. Reliance upon the registration system is an important facet of our commerce and would create chaos if reliance is taken away. Ownership does not depend upon registration. However, once a vehicle is registered following a declaration of ownership, a presumption arises in favour of the holder of the registration certificate and as a matter of commercial efficacy lenders, the police, insurers, repairmen, etc. are justified in relying upon the certificate as proof of ownership. A transfer of ownership would defeat the Credit Union's claim only if it were undertaken for value and with notice. No costs were awarded on either motion."
"The accused was charged with impaired driving and operating a motor vehicle while under the influence of alcohol. At the conclusion of the Crown's case, the defence brought a motion to exclude the Certificate of Analysis, such evidence flowing from an invalid approved screening device demand, which infringed the accused's s.8 and s.9 Charter rights. The Crown conceded that if such Charter breaches were found, the appropriate remedy would be to exclude this evidence. At issue was whether the arresting officer formed the requisite belief necessary to make a roadside demand pursuant to s. 254(2) of the Code and whether the officer's opinion, so formed, could be objectively upheld on the evidence before the court. HELD: The accused was acquitted of all charges. 1) The words 'had consumed alcohol' are insufficient insufficient for the court to conclude that the officer had a reasonable suspicion of alcohol in the body at the time of the ASD demand. 2) Evidence of consumption manifested by physical observation and/or through dialogue with the motorist may well provide such a reasonable belief of alcohol that the threshold is far lower than the required belief to make such a demand. The threshold is now far lower. The officer's objective in making the demand was to formulate a reasonable conclusion on the basis of the evidence raised by the last two grounds.  3) There being no evidence upon which to convict in regard to the second count, same is dismissed against the accused.","The accused was charged with driving while her ability to do so was impaired contrary to s. 253(a) and s. 255(1) of the Criminal Code and driving while over .08 contrary to s. 253(b) and s.255(1) of the Criminal Code. At the conclusion of the trial, the defence brought a motion to exclude the certificate of analysis as the demand flowed from an invalid approved screening device demand. HELD: The defence application to exclude the certificate of analysis based on a breach of s. 8 and s. 9 of the Charter was granted. There being no evidence upon which to convict in regard to the .08 charge, it was dismissed.  1) The Court found a distinction between 'had consumed alcohol' and 'has alcohol in the person's body'. The Court found the words 'had consumed alcohol' to be insufficient for the Court to conclude that the officer had a reasonable suspicion there was alcohol in the accused's body at the time of the demand. 2) There was no objective basis upon which a reasonable suspicion of alcohol in the body could be made. The evidence of alcohol on the breath was not reliable in the circumstances of this case. The admission of having had her last drink was possibly made after the demand and could not be relied on to formulate the required reasonable suspicion. The evidence of bloodshot eyes, empty beer bottles in a plastic bag with three persons in the car and the smell of alcohol coming from the vehicle could not alone support a reasonable conclusion of reasonable suspicion of alcohol in the body of the motorist."
"The appellant father was ordered to pay maintenance for his son pursuant to the Maintenance and Custody Act. The issue on appeal was whether the father had withdrawn and was unable to withdraw from his parent's charge at the time of the accident. HELD: The appeal was dismissed with costs payable by the father to the mother in the amount of $2,000 together with disbursements as taxed or agreed. The court was not persuaded that the judge erred in concluding that the child had not withdrawn and that it was his intention to further his education at a post-secondary educational institution. The evidence did not show any evidentiary basis upon which the judge could conclude that the Guideline amount was inappropriate or depart from it.","The son of unmarried parents, who had graduated from high school, was working part-time, living with his mother and had not made a final decision on a further course of study sustained a serious brain injury just a few months after his 19th birthday. He required extensive rehabilitation and would not regain his pre-accident physical and intellectual capacity. The mother successfully applied for a reinstatement of child support which had been discontinued by consent, pre-accident, when the son was residing with the father. The son, now 23 years old, was upgrading his high school marks at the time of the hearing and hoped to be admitted to a community college program. The father appealed. Appeal dismissed; the judge's decision to award support was not premised upon a finding that, pre-accident, the son had made a clear decision to pursue a further course of study but on the fact that the son intended to pursue his education and had not withdrawn from parental charge at the time of the accident. There was no evidence to support the allegation that the usual Guideline amount was 'inappropriate' in this case; the Act prohibited the consideration of public income assistance when fixing child support; given the uncertainty about the son's future, this was not an appropriate case for a time-limited order."
"The appellant appeals his conviction by Crawford, J.P.C. on a charge of sexual assault. The appellant testified at trial, denying the charge, but the trial judge disbelieved his evidence. On appeal, the appellant says that his conviction is a miscarriage of justice because the judge based her rejection of his testimony on material misapprehensions of the evidence. HELD: The conviction is set aside. 1) The judge's reasons for rejecting the appellant's testimony and finding that it did not raise a reasonable doubt are based on misapprehendions of evidence.  2) The appellant's evidence about the involvement of Children's Services did not permit the judge to draw any inference that the children had been badly treated or that the appellant was responsible for such treatment. The trial judge ascribed to the evidence of the complainant's mother as an allegation whereas his evidence was that he asked not to be left alone with the children. The inference drawn from this evidence could not have been more unjustified. 3) There is no other way in which the appellant’s evidence could be viewed as internally inconsistent. It was material rather than peripheral and played an essential part in his reasoning leading to the conviction.","The appellant was convicted of sexual assault. The court disbelieved his evidence, principally because it was found to be internally inconsistent. The court found that the appellant had attempted to portray himself as being good to the children but had admitted on cross-examination that the children had been removed from the home due to allegations of physical abuse and lack of food. There was no evidence before the court as to the truth of these allegations and the appellant had stated in his evidence that everyone thought that he treated the children badly. The appellant appealed. Appeal allowed; conviction set aside; new trial ordered. The trial judge misapprehended the evidence because she attributed to it a relevance that it could not have in law or in logic. The appellants evidence about the involvement of Childrens Services did not permit the judge to draw any inference that the children had, in fact, been badly treated or that the appellant was responsible for such treatment. The misapprehension, examined in the context of the judges reasons as a whole and the entire record was substantial, material and played an essential part in the judges reasoning leading to the conviction; the misapprehension had given rise to a miscarriage of justice."
"The plaintiff in a rear end motor vehicle accident applied for summary judgment and an interim payment. The defendant argued that there was an arguable issue to be tried in that even if one accepted the plaintiff's evidence that there were no brake lights on the vehicle, it had to consider the issue of contributory negligence. The plaintiff also argued that it would be a haphazard guess to determine what proportion of her damages might be recovered. Application for summary judgement granted; application for interim payment dismissed. There was no 'air of reality' to the defence; the plaintiff was making a significant claim yet when one listens to the defendant's counsel and reads the material attached to the plaintiff’s affidavit, one concludes there is a significant amount of other factors relating to the health of the plaintiff.","The plaintiff, who was injured in a rear-end motor vehicle accident, applied for summary judgment and an interim payment of damages. Application for summary judgment granted; application for interim payment dismissed. There was no 'air of reality' to the defendant's defence; whether or not the plaintiff's brake lights were working, to strike her vehicle from behind on these facts meant that the defendant was either travelling too close or didn't have enough care and control of his vehicle. The plaintiff was making a significant claim for damages but she suffered from numerous previous injuries and conditions relating to her health; any damage assessment would depend largely upon credibility and the medical evidence at trial; to assess interim damages in this case would be a most difficult task and would only be a haphazard guess. The plaintiff's claim was also complicated by the fact that it could possibly be subject to the 'minor injury' cap on damages."
"The Crown appealed the conviction of the respondent, who challenged the validity of a search warrant issued against her in relation to a grow operation. The judge quashed the warrant, finding that the warrant was valid and that the evidence obtained as a result of the search was wrongly excluded. The Crown appealed, arguing that the judge erred in law by failing to apply the proper standard of review. Allowing the appeal and ordering a new trial, that the appeal should be allowed and the trial ordered. The trial judge's approach reveals an extricable legal error which the Crown must address. It appears the judge began his analysis by properly considering whether the respondent could issue the warrant but effectively ended up considering whether he would have issued the warrant in these circumstances. The reviewing judge substituted her discretion for that of the issuing judge. This is an error of law.","The accused successfully challenged the sufficiency of the grounds to issue a search warrant that was used to search her residence. Although the Information to Obtain was based on information from an anonymous, unproven source, the source's information was corroborated by independent information as to the accused's employment and residence. The only corroboration of the presence of a crime (a suspected marijuana grow operation) was from a FLIR test. The court found that the evidence did not rise above the level of suspicion, albeit strong suspicion. Corroboration of the employment and residence of the accused did not provide particular support for the informant's credibility; neither were results of the FLIR test and the presence of covered windows sufficient corroboration. The Crown appealed. Appeal allowed; new trial ordered. Although the trial judge articulated the proper test and began by analyzing whether the warrant could have been issued, the issue was later mistakenly transformed into whether he, himself, would have issued it. By weighing the probative evidence, the trial judge effectively substituted his views for those of the issuing justice and wrongly required the issuing justice to draw proper inferences as opposed to reasonable inferences."
"An appeal of a decision of the Deputy Rentalsman, pursuant to s.47 of the Residential Tenancies Act, which dismissed an application by the landlord for a writ of possession. The issues were whether all the tenants had proper notice of the termination of the tenancy and whether the landlord could give notice of termination without any cause. HELD: The matter was remitted for rehearing upon proof of service of the Notice of Hearing on all of the tenants.  1)The landlord failed to vacate the premises in accordance with the Notice to Tenant and the Landlord applied to the Landalsman for possession. 2)The issue of service on the two tenants was not considered.  3)Although the notice of hearing was properly served, it could not be concluded that the issue was ever considered. 4)The applicant failed to demonstrate that the landlord was in contravention of any of the statutory requirements set out in Sturgess v. Gladmer. 5)The matter must be returned to the RENTALSMAN for a rehearing on the evidence of service.","This is an appeal by the landlord pursuant to s. 49 of The Residential Tenancies Act from a decision of the Deputy Rentalsman who, pursuant to s. 47 of the Act dismissed an application by the landlord for a writ of possession. HELD: The matter will be remitted to the Rentalsman for a rehearing upon proof of service of the Notice of Hearing on all of the tenants.  1) The tenants who are named in the decision are Vernon and Ivy. There is no reference to Richie whose name appears on the tenancy agreement. 2) Even though the decision states that the Notice of Hearing was properly served, that cannot be the end of the matter given that there is nothing in the file which would indicate any directions having been given to the landlord with respect to service other than personal service. Ivy and Richie did not appear at the hearing and the decision does not even identify Richie as being one of the tenants. More is required to ensure service of and notice to all the tenants. 3) There are no notes nor is there anything in the decision which would permit the Court to conclude that the issue of service on Ivy and Richie was ever considered by the Rentalsman. The matter must be returned to the Rentalsman for a rehearing upon proof of service of the hearing on all of the tenants."
"FIAT: The Court ordered a number of orders regarding child support and an order regarding summer access. The remaining issues were: what, if any, should the father pay to the mother for extraordinary expenses relating to tutoring for one or both children; what, pursuant to s. 7(1)(d) of the Divorce Act, the interim spousal support order; what retroactive support should be payable by the father to the Mother; what if any retroactive spousals should be ordered in this matter; interim spOUSAL support; interim childcare costs; interim costs. HELD: 1) The Court was unable to make a retroactive child support order because the father did not have necessary resources to pay monthly sum to the wife once he had satisfied his child support obligations. At this interim stage, the matter should not affect the right of the mother to pursue spousa support in the future. Although the father will be stretched, the mother's evidence discloses that both children, but more particularly Kody, was in need of a specialized educational program given his current problems at school. Although it is clear from the evidence that the mother has an entitlement to interim spouse support, the father does not have the ability to pay. 2) The Sylvan Learning Centre expenses were necessary and reasonable. The father's share of both childcare costs and the Sylvan learning centre expense was equal to 71% of the total cost. 3) The mother was ordered to pay costs in the sum of $400 to the father pursuant to S. 15.3(1) of The DivorceAct.","FIAT: The primary issue is whether the father should pay for tutoring expenses. HELD: 1) The father is not opposed to Kody receiving some additional educational assistance. However, he believes that the Sylvan Learning Center is too expensive. The father did not present any evidence with regard to other possible educational programs for the summer. It is clear that he has not researched alternatives to the Sylvan program. On the evidence, the expense is necessary for Kody. The real issue is whether the father has the means to contribute given his child support payments. If the father pays $472 per month for the Sylvan program, in addition to his s. 3 child support payments, the father's total child support payable would be $1,315 per month. The father would have a net monthly cash flow in the sum of $1,066 while the mother with four children would have available cash flow in the sum of $2,700 per month. Although the father will be stretched, the Sylvan program is necessary and reasonable.  2) Although the mother has an entitlement to spousal support, the father does not have the ability to pay. 3) The father shall pay costs in the sum of $400."
"This was an appeal by the landlord from an order of the Director which effectively permitted the tenant to convert what had been a year to year lease into a month to month tenancy, but also denied the landlord's request that the tenancy be deemed to have terminated because the tenant effectively refused to renew for another year. The Landlord appealed. Appeal allowed; the tenancy has not been converted into a Month to Month tenancy because the landlord refused his consent in a timely manner. The reasons for withholding consent by landlord are neither arbitrary or unreasonable; in so failing to consider the Landlord's reasons, the Court believes the Residential Tenancies Officer erred in law. The words 'the consent of the landlord shall not be withheld' are used in the meaning of the Act to denote a change in the lease from a year-to-year term to a month tenancy; in the unique circumstances of this case it is appropriate that the Tenant and not the landlord incur that risk.","The tenant's year-to-year lease ran from September 1 to August 31. Four months before it was set to automatically renew, he notified the landlord he wished to convert to a month-to-month tenancy. The landlord refused, saying vacancies were hard to fill at any time other than September 1st. The three bedroom rental was in an area with a large university student population and was targeted at individuals sharing not families. It was a high-end rental, and would not necessarily appeal to students. The landlord provided evidence that the last time it was on the market in winter, it was vacant for several months. After a Residential Tenancies Board hearing, an officer declared the tenant successful. The written decision did not mention the landlord's reasons for refusing consent, nor did it say they were arbitrary or unreasonable. The landlord appealed, but offered to compromise by allowing the tenant to terminate the lease any time between May 31 and August 31 without penalty. The officer erred in law. The Act allows the landlord some discretion to refuse a request to convert to month-to-month, providing the refusal is made reasonably. The landlord's reasons were neither unreasonable nor arbitrary, given the reality of the market and his past experiences with a winter vacancy. There may be other situations where consent could reasonably be withheld. The tenancy is declared to have been renewed for another year (with the understanding the landlord will allow the tenant to terminate at any point after May 31). Both parties acted in good faith and, while it might seem unfair to lock the tenant into a lease he believed had converted to month-to-month, the court must make the order the officer should have made in the first place."
The accused was charged with common assault and common assault. The issue was whether the evidence of the Crown was sufficiently credible to prove non-consent beyond a reasonable doubt. The only physical contact he had on the complainant was for the purpose of defending himself from the alleged aggression of the complainant. HELD: The accused was found not guilty. The Court did not know who to believe and he was not guilty of the offence of common assault contrary to s. 266 of the Criminal Code.,The accused was charged with committing a common assault against his step-sister being the complainant. The question was whether the Crown's evidence was sufficiently credible to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the only physical contact he had on the complainant was for the purpose of defending himself from the alleged aggression of the complainant and whether the Crown was able to prove non-consent beyond a reasonable doubt. HELD: The Court did not know whom to believe and the accused was acquitted.
"The appellant appealed the June 29, 2011 decision of the Criminal Appeal Court dismissing her two appeals and ordering the respondents to pay the cost of certifying the transcripts of her video appeal. At the time of her appeal, the appellant had filed a notice of appeal in the Provincial Court naming only Her Majesty the Queen and Queen's Counsel as respondents to the Court's appeal and to have the respondents pay to certify the transcripts. At that time, the respondent's notice of appeals had been filed in the Civil Appeal and no dates had been set for the filing of the required materials or the hearing of the appeal because of the appellant's seeming inability to comply on timely basis with the Rules. The appellant now sought to have all of the relevant documents and materials certified. In addition, she sought to compel the respondents, who had filed the notice of Appeal in the previous Court of Appeal, to pay for the preparation of the appealed book and to allow her to file the transcripts electronically. Motion granted; the respondents' motions to dismiss both appeals are granted.",",  motions granted. Both appeals are dismissed as a result of the appellant's failure to perfect, including her failure to file necessary materials or comply with the court's directions to do so. While a dismissal of the criminal appeal is a serious remedy, since it means it will never be heard on its merits, the appellant has made it clear that she cannot provide certified transcripts unless the court orders the respondents to pay. The court has already declined to do so. There is no suggestion a further extension of time will result in the appellant perfecting the appeal."
"The defendants applied for carriage of the proceedings in Saskatchewan and for leave to cross-examine on affidavits filed by the plaintiff and the defendant. HELD: The applications were dismissed. Leave was granted by the Local Registrar to return to the plaintiff on affidavit evidence. The application for leave was dismissed. It was apparent that if the plaintiff's affidavits were filed in support of an interlocutory application, then the defendant would be obliged to open up his or her client files for review by third parties, nor examined for discovery with respect to their proposed legal strategies, nor required to debate the merits of future legal arguments by way of cross-examination.","HELD: The Court dismissed the application. The information contained in the affidavits was uncontroverted and a matter of public record. MLG was unable to explain how cross-examination would assist the Court. As well, the application to cross-examine did not appear to rest on a real need to clarify any issues relevant to the application for which the affidavits had been filed and focused on the relative merits of legal issues rather than on evidentiary issues."
"The accused, charged with 56 offences, including conspiracy to commit the indictable offence of fraud by printing and/or cashing forged cheques, defrauding or attempting to defraud contrary to s. 380(1)(b) of the Controlled Drugs and Substances Act and possession of a counterfeit mark. He alleged the offences were absolute jurisdiction offences as per s. 553 of the Code. HELD: The accused's application for a stay of proceedings was dismissed.  1)The accused had not established on a balance of probabilities that there had been a breach of his right to be tried within a reasonable time. As a result of the factors set out in the Charter application, the accused's right to a fair trial had been infringed. 2)There was a societal interest that was adverse to the interests of the accused. As the seriousness of the offence increases so does the societal demand that the accused be brought to trial. The accused had no interest in an early trial and society's interest would not parallel that of that of his co-accused.","HELD: The application was dismissed. The court found that the 51 months between the charges and the scheduled trial was sufficiently long to warrant an inquiry into the reasonableness of the delay. As the accused had specifically and voluntarily waived almost five months of the delay, the court deducted that amount, leaving 46 months to be considered. The various types of delay were considered by the court: 11.5 for inherent delay; 15.5 months to be attributed to the actions of the accused; 10 months to be attributed to the Crown; and 10 months to institutional delay. The court found that the accused had not suffered prejudice and as most of the delay was attributable to adjournments sought on his behalf, the court found that the overall delay in this case was not unreasonable."
"The applicant sought an order that the respondents be prohibited from further proceedings or actions in relation to a formal complaint against him, dated December 15, 1988, as amended, alleging that he is guilty of conduct unbecoming a barrister and solicitor. HELD: The application was made pursuant to The Legal Profession Act, 1990 and the Hearing Committee set August 8, 1995 as the date for a hearing.  1)The hearing committee met intermittently, often by telephone conference calls, and the matter was adjourned from time to time. 2)The applicant appealed his conviction and was sentenced to 18 months imprisonment. 3)Although stay of proceedings was ordered for the period from August 1989 until January 1990, the applicant did not pay an inactive membership in the Law Society. 4)The appeal was dismissed by the Supreme Court of Canada on March 21, 1995 and the hearing committee set August 08, 1995 for the hearing. 5)The respondent did not do to the detriment of the applicant's interests.","HELD: The last two sentences were to be substituted by the appeal was dismissed by the SCC on March 21, 1995 and the Hearing Committee set August 8, 1995 as the date for a hearing."
"The Minister of Social Services sought an order under s.37(2) of the Child and Family Services Act permanently committing to the Minister all three of the children of and representing herself. The Department had been very much involved. The Minister had previously ordered the children to be permanently committed to him. At the conclusion of the hearing held to inquire into the matter, the decision was reserved. All three children were born in the foster care of and L. The mother was not able to attend the hearing but had withdrawn. HELD: 1)An officer of the Department was recommended permanent committal. 2)The children were in need of protection from domestic disharmony and domestic violence. 3)The foster parents were unable or unwilling to take action to protect the children. The child's exposure to the domestic violence may have harmed and would further harm the children emotionally. 4)The mother was found to have a dependency syndrome. 5)The Department had no authority to attach any conditions to the order.","The Minister of Social Services sought an order under s.37(2) of the Child and Family Services Act to permanently commit all three children to the Minister. The Department of Social Services had been involved with the family since the birth of the oldest child. The children had been in the care of the Minister at various times and parent aides provided help to the parents when there was child or children at home. The Minister called 18 witnesses. HELD: All three children were committed permanently to the Minister. 1)The mother appeared to be more anxious about excusing the father, who was an abusive alcoholic, than about protecting the children. The mother was unable to parent any of the children on her own. It was concluded under s.11(b) of the Act that there was no adult person able and willing to provide for the children's needs and physical or emotional harm may come to the children if it had not already. 2)The father had recently pleaded guilty to sexual assault on an eight year old girl which could, depending on the facts be a ground under s.11(a)(iii) of the Act for a finding of need for protection."
"The Crown applied for a review under s. 679 of the Criminal Code when the appellant at the time of the application was on release from the federal penitentiary on day parole granted by the National Parole Board under Part ll of the Corrections and Conditional Release Act. A written decision granting the release with conditions was issued on the same date as the amended order. The appeal was slated to be heard January 26, 2000. After reviewing the decision of Justice Cromwell and without any new precedents being provided by the Crown following an opportunity to do so, and on the facts of this case, the Court of Appeal refused to exercise its discretion and issued a written decision. The Appeal denied. The Court of Queen's Bench ordered the release of the appellant pending review of the 679 application. The decision of the Chambers judge was reviewed and without a change in the circumstances the decision could not be appealed. Based upon the opinion of C.J.N.S. in a commentary following s. 680, it was concluded that the Court misinterpreted the definition of custody.","The appellant was granted release pending appeal, on conditions. The Crown applied for a review. The Crown contended that the Chambers judge misinterpreted the definition of custody in granting the application, as the appellant was on day parole at the time of the application. Dismissing the application, that day parole with a requirement to return to a halfway house each night is a form of custody which allows for an application and release under s. 679 of the Code."
"The Crown applied pursuant to s. 771 for an order forfeiting the amount of bail set out in a recognizance entered into the the accused in the respect of a twelve year old girl. The accused was charged with four criminal matters, of sexual assault, uttering a threat, sexual touching under s. 151 and unlawfully having a weapon. HELD: The applications for forfeiture were dismissed. The surety was to be responsible for the sum of $1,000. The court found with respect to the following issues: 1) that the accused deliberately left the province to avoid his trial; 2) that he failed to take into account certain important factors; 3) the accused was found to have been in breach of his obligation to appear in Court for trial on a number of criminal charges; and 4) that it would not be just and appropriate to order forfeiture on the part of the surety. The judge had discretion whether to order it against the accused or both. The application for forfeiture was dismissed.","The accused was charged with four offences relating to a twelve year old girl, including sexual assault and uttering a threat. He was released on bail with a surety. The accused is paraplegic. He moved to British Columbia after his release. He did not appear for trial, and a Canada wide warrant was issued for his arrest. He was arrested and returned to stand trial. The Crown applied to have bail and the surety forfeited. It took the position that the accused had deliberately left the province to avoid trial, and therefore should be responsible for the full $1,000. It also contended that the sureties had a responsibility to ensure the accused's attendance at trial, and that they should also be responsible for the full $1,000. The surety testified that the conditions of the recognizance were not explained to him, and he did not understand the potential consequences of default. Dismissing the applications for forfeiture, that the surety had no concept of his obligations under the recognizance, and was not made aware of those obligations by the authorities. In these circumstances, it would not be just to order forfeiture. With respect to the accused, he is impecunious. His failure to pay any amount ordered against him could lead to imprisonment. As the accused already faces the prospect of imprisonment for failing to attend trial, this would create the potential of double liability for what is in essence the same offence."
"The Crown applied pursuant to s. 16(1) of the Controlled Drug and Substances Act for an order forfeiting the Lincoln. The registered owner of the vehicle was charged with trafficking in marijuana and possession for the purpose of trafficking. Fair was found guilty of possession for trafficking and the other charge was stayed. Brooks applied pursuant pursuant to S. 20(4) of The Controlled Drug & Substances Authority for an Order declaring that her interest in the Lincoln is not affected by any forfeiture order. HELD: The application was dismissed. The sentence imposed would be grossly disproportionate to the offence and the offender would be sentenced to a standard of punishment not available to the general public but to the extent that the offender received the punishment prescribed in s. 11 of the Charter. The societal purpose of the Act and the provisions related to the forfeiture of property was stated in R. v. Gisby. The offender deserves the punishment that is available to her. The criminal justice system does not allow the granting of a standard punishment, but rather an order of forfeiture, which is the standard for successful forfeiture applications. The administration of justice is served by the court applying the s. 20 provision of the act. The provisions of the Criminal Drug and Substance Act (CDSA) provide the court with the tools to obtain relief from forfeiture. The CDSA does so both through punishment and deterrence. The driver of the Lincoln was found innocent of any complicity in the designated substance offence and Brooks was found not guilty. The judge concluded that the standard of treatment available to offenders is not available in the context of s. 12 of the charter. The court concluded that it would be appropriate to grant the relief sought by the applicant in this application, but not in this case, that the relief was only available to an accused who had been convicted of the designated substances offence and who exercised all reasonable care to avoid punishment. The Crown did not prove that Brooks consented to the illegal possession of the marijuana.","The Crown applied for an order forfeiting a vehicle pursuant to s.16(1) of the Controlled Drug and Substances Act. The registered owner applied for an order declaring her interest in the vehicle was not affected by any forfeiture order. The owner was passenger when 28.3 pounds of marijuana was discovered in the trunk of her Lincoln. She was found not guilty of trafficking and possession of marijuana for the purpose of trafficking. The driver was found guilty of possession for the purpose of trafficking. The trafficking charge against him was judicially stayed. HELD: An order of forfeiture issued pursuant to s.16(1). The application for relief was dismissed. 1)It was not necessary to address the Charter submissions with respect to s.19(3) because Crown counsel consented to the respondent's application being viewed as an application for relief from forfeiture under s.20. 2)It was impossible to conclude the respondent 'appeared innocent of any complicity' in the offence for which the driver was convicted and that she 'exercised all reasonable care to be satisfied' that the Lincoln was not likely to be used in the commission of the offence. 3)Section 11 of the Charter applies only when person has been charged with an offence. There was no charge against the respondent at this time. 4)The Act distinguishes between three types of persons who might own, or have an interest in, conveyance which is 'offence-related property': the interest of person convicted of the offence is forfeitable pursuant to s.16(1); if the person has been neither convicted nor charged and appears innocent of any complicity in the offence; someone charged with the offence which gave rise to the forfeiture application (as here). The forfeiture is not, except with respect to an offender, arbitrary. In view of the provisions available under the Act to obtain relief from forfeiture it cannot be concluded that empowering a court to grant an order of forfeiture constitutes cruel or unusual punishment."
"This was an application advanced by seven applicants for an order pursuant to Civil Procedure Rule 56 in the nature of certiorari to quash the decision of the Board to close the two schools. All seven applicants are parents of children attending the school and none of the applicants have children attending Notting Park. The applicant also raises an issue of standing. HELD: 1) The applicants should not have standing and an order should issue dismissing the application. There is no basis in this proceeding to exercise such discretion.  2) There has not been established the applicants were directly affected by the closure of the school. They say the recommendation from the School Review Committee, that 79 students would be transferred from Notting Park to Northbrook, permits it to be said the applicants are aggrieved persons. It seems to be remote when there is no reality that the issue in dispute will be determined in another forum or in a different proceeding, at the instance of person who would have standing.","The applicants applied for an order in the nature of certiorari to quash the decision of the school board to close two schools. The applicants were parents of children who attended one of the two closed schools., application allowed in part; certiorari granted in respect of the decision to close the school which the applicants' children attended; the applicants had no standing to challenge the closure of the second school as they were not directly affected by its closure. The School Board breached its general duty to act fairly in allowing a Board member to vote when he had not attended the public meetings on the issue. The Board did not meet the onus on it to show that the member had appropriate firsthand knowledge of the evidence and submission of the applicants."
"The plaintiff sought damages for injuries sustained when she slipped and fell while grocery shopping in the defendant's Superstore. The defendant placed an issue on whether it was liable to the plaintiff for injuries she sustained in the slip and fall and the degree of personal injury sustained by the plaintiff as a result of the accident. HELD: The claim was dismissed with costs. 1)The defendant met the legal standard of care imposed upon it in the circumstances and was not liable for the injuries suffered. The overall policies and practices of regular maintenance of the floor areas combined with the responsibility of each employee to carry them out were substantially the same if not identical to those considered by the Court in the Mollenhauer and Leibel group of cases. 2)There have been many cases that have found slippery substance such as water or produce on the floor of grocery store to constitute an unusual danger. On the basis of all of the evidence, the plaintiff met the burden of establishing on a balance of probabilities that she slipped because of water on the Floor of the store. 3)The evidence did not support an inference that the plaintiff's footwear caused or was a contributing factor to the fall. 4)There was no evidence that any of the defendants, including the owner and occupier, had any reasonable care to prevent damage from the 'unusual danger' described in Maxay v. Ramsay Drugs Ltd. (1991), 89 Sask. R. 191 (Q.B.). 5)Although the defendant does not contest the presence of water in the vicinity of where the plaintiff slipped, it does concede that it was the water that caused the plaintiff to slip. However, certain assertions in the affidavit relating to her injuries and treatment were inconsistent with the physician notes and medical reports filed in evidence and with information elicited during cross-examination. Some of the injuries appeared to have been the aggravation of pre-existing conditions. 6)The plaintiff did not know the water was there, but did know that water and other substances could be in the produce department and who would be assumed to be willing to assist that party. 7)There were no adverse inference from the absence of an explanation as to the amount of time it had taken the defendant to clean the floor. If so, did the occupier have reason to know about it? 8)The preponderance of evidence therefore establishes that the floor where the accident occurred had been swept very close to one hour before the plaintiff fell. A regular program of maintenance had been conducted by the defendant in that area.","The plaintiff sought damages for personal injuries to her lower back, right knee and left ankle sustained when she slipped and fell while grocery shopping in March 2000. The defendant acknowledged the plaintiff fell in its produce department, but did not concede the water on the floor caused her to slip; the cause was, in part, her worn running shoes without laces. Liability and degree of personal injury were in issue. The claim proceeded under the simplified procedure under Part Forty of the Queen's Bench Rules. HELD: The claim was dismissed with costs. 1)The defendant had a duty of care to the plaintiff as owner and occupier. The courts have most often based the duty of care on the invitor/invitee standard. Maxay v. Ramsay Drugs proposed four-part inquiry to determine whether or not an occupier has breached its duty of care. 2)The plaintiff established on a balance of probabilities that she slipped because of water on the floor. The evidence did not support an inference that her footwear caused the slip or was a contributing factor. 3)An adverse inference was not drawn from the defendant's failure to adduce evidence confirming its employee had in fact cleaned the floor. The employee was no longer employed by the defendant. Neither party was able to locate him. 4)Some of her injuries were, in part, the aggravation of pre-existing conditions. The most significant injury was sprain to her left ankle, which had not been resolved primarily because the plaintiff declined to accept available treatment and failed to follow medical advice. The inconsistencies in her affidavit and the physician notes or medical reports respecting her injuries and treatment were not relevant to this decision. 5)A 'sweep log' was kept for each department and employees made regular inspections of the sales floor area in every department. The plaintiff slipped and fell about an hour after the last sweeping. A regular program of maintenance was conducted in the area. The overall policies and practices of regular maintenance and responsibility of each employee were substantially the same if not identical to those considered in the Mollenhauer and Libel group of cases. The defendant met the legal standard of care imposed in the circumstances and was not liable for the plaintiff's injuries. To find otherwise would be to impose a standard that is inconsistent with that previously imposed by this court in almost identical circumstances."
"The appellant was charged with impaired driving contrary to the findings that he had been drinking, had a very slight accident and failed the roadside screening device. The Provincial Court judge dismissed the refusal count as the officer had failed in his testimony to give evidence of the words used in the 'Breathalyzer' demand. That decision was not under appeal. The appeal was allowed and the conviction quashed. Allowing the appeal and ordering a new trial, that the trial judge erred in failing to address the defence evidence that the appellant had bloodshot eyes and a moderate smell of alcohol on him. The trial judge did not address defence evidence adduced by the Crown and the defence with respect to the impaired driving charge.","The police observed the appellant's vehicle rub another vehicle and followed him to where he parked without difficulty. While taking the appellant to where the incident occurred, the officer noted slight smell of alcohol and bloodshot eyes. The appellant failed the ALERT test and refused the breathalyzer. The refusal charge was dismissed and the appellant was convicted of impaired driving. The appellant appealed. Appeal allowed; conviction quashed. The evidence of impairment was too weak to convict the appellant. The officer told the accused that if he passed the ALERT test, he would be sent on his way. Thus, she must not have thought that the appellant's ability to operate a motor vehicle was impaired. Failure to act cannot be considered by the trial judge as part of the reasonable and probable grounds."
"FIAT. The husband applied to vary the May 2002 support order on the basis that his income had decreased, the parties' oldest child was no longer a child within the meaning of the Divorce Act and his s. 7 expenses had not been incurred for more than a year. The wife opposed the application arguing the layoff was only temporary and that the child continued to be a child of the marriage within the means of the Act. HELD: 1)The husband's obligation to contribute to the child's riding lessons was terminated effective March 31, 2003. 2)The wife's application to increase the husband's contribution for her son's extracurricular activities was dismissed. 3)If the wife followed through with her plan and if she did not, the child may requalify as a 'child of themarriage' within s. 14 of the Guidelines. However, costs were warranted in this case because of the unreasonableness of the wife's position. The unfavourable economic circumstances had not resulted in a change in circumstances. The parties' current income had increased from $23,945 per annum to $37,219 and the husband had been laid off his employment by the time the order was granted. It was not clear if the wife had any knowledge of when the husband would be rehired or if he received employment insurance benefits in 1999 and 2000. The family law judge found that the wife was not entitled to costs of this application.","FIAT. At issue was whether there a change of circumstances, which would warrant a variation of the 2002 child support order; whether the 18 year old continued to be a child within the meaning of the Divorce Act; does the father have an obligation to contribute to his daughter's riding lessons; the father's income for child support purposes; should the 17 year old son's s.7 expenses be increased; costs. HELD: 1)The daughter had ceased to be a child of the marriage within the meaning of the Divorce Act and the father's obligation to provide on-going support and his contribution for s.7 expenses relating to her riding lesson terminated in March 2003. 2)The father shall pay $308 per month for support of his son commencing April 1, 2003 and every month thereafter so long as he remains a child within the meaning of the Divorce Act. 3)The mother's application to increase the father's contribution for the son's extracurricular activities was dismissed. The father shall pay $54 per month for hockey expenses commencing June 2003 and every month thereafter. 4)The mother was to forthwith pay costs of the application fixed at $250."
"This was an application for a stay of proceedings based on a violation of the right to be tried within a reasonable time pursuant to s. 11(b) of the Charter. The applicant was charged with exceeding the Breathalyzer and impaired driving. On November 12, 2002, he was arraigned on the information (sworn to September 29, 2002). He entered not guilty plea and requested the first available date for trial (December 18, 2003). It was anticipated that one full day would be required as the Defense intended to make a Charter motion and lead evidence. The accused waived the delay or part of it such that the remainder is not unreasonable. The court found that prejudice can be inferred on the basis that the length of the delay is likely to interfere with the quality of evidence tendered, given the passage of time that has occurred since the charges were filed.","The defendant applied for a stay of proceedings on the basis of a violation of his right to be tried in a reasonable time. There had been delay of approximately 14.5 months from the time that he was charged with exceeding the breathalyzer and impaired driving to the date of his trial. Stay of proceedings granted. At his first court appearance the defendant requested the first available trial date and there was no evidence to suggest that an institutional delay of 13 months was the norm in other metro provincial courts. Given the nature of the charges, the technical nature of breathalyzer law and the defendant's stated intention to raise ss. 8 and 9 of the Charter, prejudice could be inferred on the basis that the length of delay was likely to interfere with the quality of evidence tendered."
"HELD: On this application to lift the stay imposed by Rule 15 on the judgment of Klebuc J. dated February 25, 2004, I decline to do so for these reasons. The Court of Appeal has stayed the execution of Klebbuc J.'s judgment does not revive the prior maintenance order and that a Court of Court of appeal chambers judge does not have the authority to make such an order. The mother is to file her appeal book and factum 15 days after receiving the transcript. The father is to pay $600 maintenance for March 1st as soon as is reasonably possible and for April 1st on that day. Costs are left to the division of the Court hearing the appeal.","This was an application to lift the stay imposed by Rule 15 of The Court of Appeal Rules. HELD: The Court declined to lift the stay. While a chambers judge acting under s. 20 of The Court of Appeal Act may not have the independent authority to make a maintenance order, a chambers judge has the authority to stay a judgment in its entirety in the Court of Queen's Bench in certain cases as long as doing so does not decide the appeal. The Court of Appeal stayed the decision of Klebuc J., which left the order of Wright in place, which maintained the existing maintenance obligation."
"The accused was charged that he did operate a motor vehicle while his ability to do so was impaired by alcohol or a drug, contrary to s. 253(a) of the Criminal Code. The issue was whether the evidence was sufficient to prove impairment beyond a reasonable doubt. HELD: The accused was acquitted of all charges.  1)The Court found that the accused was not displaying any symptoms of impairment. The only signs of impairment were his blood alcohol consumption, a very strong smell of alcohol and a flushed face. 2)On the Crown evidence, the accused did not display slurred speech. He appeared to fully comprehend his rights and obligations in his communications with the peace officer and legal aid duty counsel. However, his response in stopping was somewhat delayed and he braked abruptly. The opportunity to make the observations was only during roughly 2 minutes. 3)The accused suggested that his bloodshot or watery eyes may have been the result of his previous consumption of alcohol or drugs. 4)The court concluded that in the absence of expert evidence to explain the scientific basis for these tests, the proper method of application and to comment on their reliability, it was not appropriate for the court to rely upon them on the issue of guilt or innocence, to the prejudice of the accused.","The accused youth is charged with driving a motor vehicle while his ability to do so was impaired by alcohol or drug contrary to s. 253(a) of the Criminal Code. The issue was whether the evidence was sufficient to prove impairment beyond a reasonable doubt. HELD: The only reliable indicia of impairment were a very strong odour of alcohol and a flushed face. Beyond that, the indicators are either inconclusive, non-existent or the accused offered a reasonable explanation for them. The evidence is so frail as to leave a reasonable doubt as to impairment and the accused was acquitted. 1) The accused was exceeding the speed limit and failed to signal lane changes. His vehicle wandered somewhat in the lane, but did not stray into the other lane. The observations of his driving were made over 2-minute period. The aspects of the driving that were observed may have been the result of driver inattention. 2) The bloodshot eyes may have been the result of chain smoking. Further, the evidence of glazed eyes is inconclusive in the absence of reliable evidence of bloodshot eyes. 3) The evidence of flushed face was reliable evidence of impairment. 4) The evidence of strong odour of alcohol is reliable indicia of impairment, due to the consumption of alcohol by the accused. 5) The accused did not have any problem with balance, but was moving in slow and deliberate manner. If the accused was not displaying difficulty with balance and coordination, then the suggestion that he was moving slowly is not a credible indicator of impairment. The accused did not display slurred speech and appeared to comprehend his legal rights and obligations. He did not display any mental confusion or inappropriate behaviour. In the absence of expert evidence to explain the scientific basis for the physical tests administered, the proper method of application and their reliability the Court could not rely on them. 6) The accused blew 80 milligrams on two occasions. However, regardless of the alcohol consumption and the accused blood alcohol concentration, the only reliable indicia of impairment were a strong odour of alcohol and a flushed face."
The accused was charged with two counts of assault causing bodily harm contrary to s. 267(b) of the Criminal Code and one count of attempting to strike the complainant with a motor vehicle thereby committing aggravated assault. HELD: The accused was found guilty on both counts.  1)The evidence established that the accused operated the motor vehicle in a manner dangerous to the public and the Crown had proven each and every ingredient of this offence to my satisfaction beyond a reasonable doubt. The offence requires a marked departure from prudent conduct.  2)The Court found the accused guilty on all of the counts. The Court found him guilty of both charges.,"The accused was charged with aggravated assault contrary to s. 268 of the Criminal Code; assault causing bodily harm contrary to s. 267(b) of the Code; dangerous driving contrary to s. 249(1)(a) of the Code; and two counts of assault contrary to s. 266(a) of the Code. HELD: 1) On the charge that the accused endangered the life of the complainant by attempting to strike her with a motor vehicle, the Court had strong suspicions that the accused did intend to strike the complainant with the vehicle but could not convict. 2) There was no doubt that bodily harm was caused to the complainant. The accused admits he slung her on the ground and kicked her and, as a result, the court find the accused guilty of assault causing bodily harm. 3) There is no doubt that the accused was operating a truck and that he drove it toward the complainant, who was lying on the concrete, and her daughter. It is unnecessary for the Crown to prove that the lives or safety of others were actually endangered. The offence is proved where the Crown establishes that the driving complained of was dangerous to the public. The offence requires a marked departure from prudent conduct. The offence of dangerous driving was established and the accused was found guilty. 4) The accused was found guilty of two counts of assault."
"The accused was charged that, on or about August 21, 2003, he did commit a sexual assault on the complainant contrary to s. 271 of the Criminal Code. The Crown elected to proceed summarily. The accused was employed as clerk at the Provincial Court Building. She assumed her duties in 1998 and although she testified that she knew of the accused in 1999, it was much more likely that she met him in the spring of 2002 after he assumed his duties as Justice of the Peace in the same building. HELD: The Court found that the accused’s perception of his relationship with the complainant was that of someone who had been sexually assaulted by the accused and that, based on the evidence provided by the complainant, he had not been detained and that his right to counsel under s. 10(b) of the Charter had been infringed.  1) It was necessary that certain findings of credibility be made in this case.  2) There was some consistency as to the incidents that occurred prior to August 21 and the same cannot be said about the events of August 21.","The accused is charged with committing a sexual assault contrary to s. 271 of the Criminal Code. The accused was police officer with the Regina Police Service for 25 years until he retired in 1999 with the rank of Deputy Chief of Police. In the fall of 2001, he was appointed Justice of the Peace. The Crown proceeded summarily. The first incident involved the accused bringing the complainant's hand to his crotch. The second incident involved the accused touching the complainant's breast and crotch and trying to kiss her. The issues are whether the Crown proved the actus reus and mens rea of the offence. HELD: The accused is guilty of sexually assaulting the complainant in both courtroom 10 and the Youth Court general office. 1) The alleged touching occurred and it was of a sexual nature. The complainant did not consent to the contact. 2) The parties, along with most of the employees in the building, were often subject to or the source of numerous crude jokes and comments of a sexual nature. The accused believed that his discussions with the complainant about such matters were serious. However, at no time did the accused express his desire to get to know her or to see her outside of the workplace. He did not raise the possibility of physical relationship nor did she express any interest in sexual liaison. When he suggested it, she was not enthusiastic. The interactions described by the accused are more consistent with normal interaction between persons in that particular workplace than with an indication of consent to sexual activity. Looking at all the evidence, there is nothing to support an honest belief on the part of the accused that the complainant consented to the sexual contact. The accused's suggestion that he had an honest but mistaken belief in consent cannot be considered because the Court could not cobble together from the totality of the evidence sufficient evidence from which it could be said that the accused could have drawn an honestly held belief or from which he could have honestly inferred that the complainant had consented to his touching her."
"The plaintiff applies for certification of this action pursuant to the Class Actions Act on behalf of himself and the other passengers of an international flight being chartered by Air Canada. The flight was delayed for about an hour and half at the Punta Cana airport as a result of several evolving mechanical difficulties referred to by the pilot as 'creeping delay'. The defendants opposed the certification application on the basis that none of the five criteria as set out in s. 6(a) of the Act had been met by the applicant. The plaintiff states that the plaintiff was negligent in not taking appropriate precautions and should have made alternate arrangements or taken additional precautions to ensure that there were no excessive delays. Regarding the plaintiff's claim for damages against Air Canada, the Court notes that Air Canada has incorporated into its Act the provisions of the Montreal Convention of 1999 relating to carriage by air. In this case, the plaintiff alleged damages against the Air Canada and its subsidiaries for alleged negligence, breach of contract or breach of a contract by the airline. Corrigendum received dated July 20, 2006 and added to fulltext. The court found that although the onus is on the plaintiffs, on certification application, to satisfy the Court that the pleadings disclose cause of action, it is not very high onus.","The plaintiff applies for certification pursuant to The Class Actions Act on behalf of himself and the other passengers of an international flight from the Dominican Republic to Regina. The flight was delayed for about 1.5 hours at the Dominican Republic airport as result of several mechanical difficulties. The claim is with respect to alleged negligence, unlawful confinement and breach of contract. HELD: The applicant has failed to establish the first criteria as set out in s. 6(a) of the Act. The application for certification is dismissed on that basis. 1) The court accepts that all of the defendants are governed by the provisions of the Montreal Convention of 1999. The wording of Article 29 of that agreement is clear. Any claims for damages of passenger of an international flight can only be brought within the ambit of the Montreal Convention of 1999. The court reviewed the cases and found that the plaintiff's claims outside the ambit of the Montreal Convention of 1999 in negligence, breach of contract, unlawful confinement and punitive damages do not disclose a cause of action. 2) The sole exclusive remedy available to passengers is set out in Article 17(1) of the Montreal Convention of 1999. strict liability regime has been set up with cap of damages where passenger sustains 'bodily injury' as result of an injury that occurs in the course of embarking or disembarking. It is settled law that for a passenger to have access to Article 17(1), the individual must have suffered a bodily injury as opposed to mere mental anguish. It has not been established that any bodily injury has been sustained by any of the passengers on Flight 361. It is plain and obvious that the claim does not raise a reasonable cause of action. Corrigendum received dated July 20, 2006 and added to fulltext."
"The Crown appeals the decision of the learned Provincial Court judge that found the respondent's rights under s. 10(b) of the Charter of Rights and Freedoms had been violated and, in excluding the certificate of analyses, acquitted the respondent. HELD: 1) The trial judge failed to address the issue of whether the respondent required the police in the Saskatchewan jurisdiction, where faced with a detainee that has changed his mind and declined legal advice, to inform that detainee that he has a right to retain counsel and an obligation on the part of the police during this time to refrain from having them participate in any potentially incriminating process until he has had that reasonable opportunity to contact counsel. The respondent's waiver of the right to seek advice from a lawyer was not supported by the evidence. 2) In reviewing the evidence that was before the trial judge, the judge could not have reasonably reached the conclusion he did, and the evidence falls far short of proving that the respondent was frustrated. Impatient, probably, but not frustrated. The evidence shows a detainee who chose to neither wait for the telephone line to be available nor to telephone a private lawyer. The Crown argued that the ratio decidendi in Prosper required Cst. Lerat to provide the respondent with an additional component of information once the respondent, after first asserting his right to counsel, waived that right. 3) The holding-off requirement in R. v. Prosper flows logically from the two implementation duties of s. 7 and s. 9 of the charter. The trial court concluded that the breach of the accused's right to free, preliminary legal advice goes directly to his right against self-incrimination. The receipt of the breathalyzer certificate in this case was a direct result of the breach and because of that it must be kept out, as it would be unfair to proceed with the trial without it going in, given the circumstance. The certificate is excluded.","The Crown appeals the decision of the Provincial Court judge that found the respondent's rights under s. 10(b) of the Charter has been violated and in excluding the certificate of analysis, acquitted the respondent. The Crown argues that the trial judge misapplied the reasoning of the Supreme Court in R. v. Prosper in his analysis of the circumstances surrounding the police officer's demand for the respondent to provide his breath sample. The issue on this appeal is whether Prosper requires the police in the Saskatchewan jurisdiction, where faced with a detainee that has changed his mind and declined legal advice, to inform that detainee that he has a right to a reasonable opportunity to contact a lawyer and that the police have an obligation not to require the detainee to participate in any incriminating process until the detainee has had a reasonable opportunity to contact a lawyer. HELD: 1) Prosper addresses the issue of the police's obligation in jurisdictions where free, preliminary legal advice is unavailable. Oppositely, Saskatchewan has Brydges duty counsel available to detainees and no such obligation exists. Having reviewed the law as stated in Prosper, the Court concluded that the trial judge erred in finding that this case was analogous to the facts in Prosper, and in finding that the police officer had an obligation to provide a 'Prosper warning' to the respondent once the respondent had changed his mind and declined legal advice. 2) The police in Saskatchewan are required to provide any detainee with information so that detainee may access that legal advice. Once the police are confronted with detainee who changes his mind and declines legal advice, this waiver must be clear and unequivocal. 3) The evidence falls far short of proving that the respondent was frustrated, impatient probably, but not frustrated. The exchange lasted about minutes. The evidence shows a detainee who chose to neither wait for the telephone line to be available nor to telephone a private lawyer."
"HISTORICAL REVIEW: The respondent applies to vary child support orders pursuant to s. 17(1) of the Divorce Act and s. 10 of The Family Maintenance Act. In addition to a variation of the amount of child support, the respondent asks that the variation order apply retroactively to July 2003. The respondent alleges an agreement was struck, whereas the petitioner denies such an agreement. HELD: The application is dismissed. 1) There is no evidence that the respondent's delay between June 2004 and July 2006 (the first time the respondent broached the issue of revising child support by sending a letter to the petitioner) is a reasonable excuse for inaction. 2) There was no agreement or obligation to disclose. The petitioner has not engaged in blameworthy conduct. The parties negotiated through their lawyers, as well as the petitioner and respondent personally discussing the child support issue. 3) The annual increases equivalent to roughly 10% per annum when adjusted for the annual rate of inflation are not so significant that the petitioner would have reasonably thought that she was feathering her own nest at the expense of her children. 4) The respondent's failure to disclose her tax return on June 30, 2004 and each June 30 thereafter constituted a breach of their alleged 2003 agreement. 5) The petitioner's obligation to pay retroactive support of $4,322, whether payable in a lump sum or by installments over time, would represent a hardship to a wage earner in the petitioner's category.","The primary issue in this application is the respondent's claim to retroactive support. HELD: 1) The Court reviewed the cases from the Supreme Court of Canada regarding retroactive child support and in particular D.B.S. v. S.R.G. et al, 2006 SCC 37. 2) The respondent has been content to accept $380 per month as fair level of child support for both children. What precipitated the respondent's review in July 2006 was Meghan's departure from his home where she began to live independently with the prospect of attending college. What further propelled the continued action on the respondent's part was the publicity attendant with the Supreme Court of Canada's release of its judgment in July 2006. There is no reasonable excuse as to why the respondent did not seek a variation earlier, other than concluding that the respondent accepted $380 per month as reasonable in the circumstances that prevailed from July 2003 to July 2006. 3) There is no evidence of blameworthy conduct on the petitioner's part. There was no agreement or obligation to disclose tax returns. No written request was made pursuant to s. 25 of the Guidelines. No verbal request was made by the respondent which might fall within the definition of 'effective notice'. The increase in the petitioner's level of income over the years 2002 to 2005 is not so dramatic as to constitute blameworthy conduct that privileges the petitioner's own interests over her children's right to an appropriate amount of support. In 2002, the petitioner earned $32,800 and, by 2005, she earned $43,310. An increase of these proportions would not lead the Court to conclude that the petitioner was not contributing to her children's support in a satisfactory manner. The Court's view of the evidence is that the annual increases equivalent to roughly 10% per annum, when adjusted for the annual rate of inflation, are not so significant that the petitioner would have reasonably thought that she was feathering her own nest at the expense of her children. 4) There was no evidence that the children's standard of living was compromised as a direct consequence of the petitioner not taking the initiative to adjust her child support payments annually. Nor was there evidence of financial hardship experienced by the children. 5) To order retroactive support of $4,322, whether payable in a lump sum or by installments over time, would represent a hardship to a wage earner in the petitioner's category. The application for retroactive child support is dismissed."
"The accused brings an application pursuant to s. 520 of the Criminal Code for a review of the order denying him judicial interim release. HELD: The application is dismissed. The onus is on the accused to show cause why his detention in custody is not justified within the meaning of s. 515(10) of the Code.  1) The accused received the benefit of conditional sentence in April 2006 and in July was found to have breached the orders that formed part of the conditional sentence. He is now charged with another violent offence, which is alleged to have occurred in September, he was once again released from custody in October. This was followed by the allegation of another violent assault which was alleged to occur in September.  2) The Court put significant weight on the offender's continued disregard of court orders and fact that the number and severity of the assault incidents is increasing.","The accused brings an application pursuant to s. 520 of the Criminal Code for a review of the order denying him judicial interim release.

The accused received the benefit of conditional sentence in April 2006 and in July was found to have breached the orders which formed part of the conditional sentence. He is now facing additional allegations of breach. Even though he was bound by conditional sentence and was charged with another violent offence, which is alleged to have occurred in September, he was once again released from custody in October.

The applicant applied for an order under s. 178(1.1) of the Bankruptcy and Insolvency Act that does not apply to his outstanding student loan debt. The applicant had and will continue to experience financial difficulty so as to be unable to pay the liabilities under the loan. The debt in effect can either be cancelled or affirmed. HELD: The application was opposed by the Attorney General of Canada. The court found that allowing the applicant a reasonably frugal family lifestyle will not permit him to pay his liabilities for the student loan. Using the Superintendent's Standards he may have a monthly surplus of about $170. It would take many years for him to contribute enough to significantly reduce this liability.,"The applicant school teacher asked to be discharged from $20k in student loan debts under s.178(1.1) of the Bankruptcy and Insolvency Act. He had filed consumer proposal in 2001, which he completed successfully in 2006. He earned $50,874 (gross) per annum; was at the top of his pay scale; had two young children; and his wife worked half-time position at Aliant, earning $16,272 year. There were daycare costs when the wife worked, and the applicant's transportation costs were high (but reasonable). The wife had significant debts and no remaining credit; she paid around $1,000 month to service her cards. The applicant did not have any credit either. Their home had little, if any, equity. The AG agreed the applicant had acted in good faith, but contested whether he was (and would continue to be) unable to pay the debt. Application allowed. Permitting the applicant's family a reasonably frugal lifestyle, which the court found they had, would mean he could not pay off the loan. Using the Superintendent's standards, there might be a small surplus in the family budget, but it would take many years for the applicant to significantly reduce his liability. If the application were refused, he would have to consider bankruptcy."
"The appellant was a student at St. Francis Xavier University when he sent an email to his computer science professor with an attachment. Although the professor did not take the content of the attachment as a threat, he sent it to university officials as he had been requested to alert them to any odd or unusual behaviour by the appellant. The police were contacted and a charge was laid against the appellant of uttering a threat to the professor to cause his death, contrary to s.264.1(1)(a) of the Criminal Code. The appellant did not have a lawyer when he stood his trial in May 2008 in Provincial Court. He was found guilty and was sentenced immediately following the conclusion of his trial to an 18 month suspended sentence, and placed on probation with conditions. Counsel was retained and an appeal commenced from conviction and sentence, alleging improper admission of evidence, unfair and prejudicial cross-examination of the appellant and a failure to give due consideration to a conditional discharge. New counsel took over carriage of the appeal. The trial judge did not address any of the instances of prejudicial or hearsay evidence that came in through the witness.","An unrepresented university student appealed his conviction for uttering threats after he sent an email to his computer science professor requesting his assistance to de-bug a program contained in an attachment. The attachment was text file with lot of extra characters, including messages that read 'good job, but am going to kill you' and 'I am so horny.' Although the professor had not taken the content of the attachment as threat, he had sent it on to university officials as he had been requested to alert them to any odd or unusual behaviour by the student. The student later advised the professor that he had typed the messages because he thought someone was monitoring what he was typing and he was trying to get reaction out of them. He also testified that he had not intended to send that particular attachment to the professor. Appeal allowed; conviction quashed. The trial judge erred in permitting inadmissible evidence to be adduced from the university administration to the effect that the accused had a psychiatric illness and, in failing to intervene when the Crown assumed that the student had put his character in issue and cross-examined him as to alleged prior acts of misconduct and other extraneous matters, the cumulative effect of which was fatal to the trial judge's findings of credibility. The case against the student was entirely circumstantial and it was equally open to infer that the words had been typed in the file to get a reaction from people that the student, rationally or otherwise, believed to be monitoring his keystrokes and did not constitute a threat to cause death to the professor."
"This was an appeal from a judgment in which the trial judge held that the sale of farm land by the then 79-year-old appellant was valid and that her solicitor in the transaction was not negligent. The appellant sought to set aside the transaction under various heads of contract law including duress, undue influence, unconscionability, equitable fraud and mistake. The trial judge made critical findings of fact, including comprehension and desire to provide benefit to the Clements. These findings were supported by candid admissions at trial. HELD: The appeals against both the Clement and the solicitors were dismissed. The Court found that the central facts of the contract, the competence of the appellant and the relationship with and conduct of the Cels was supported by probative evidence and the candid admissions of the applicant at trial, who was herself a daughter of the solicitor.  It was impossible for the Court of Appeal to interfere with the findings of facts. On these facts no possible attack on the contract exists. On the facts no case of breach of contract exists and no possible assault on the agreement exists.","This is an appeal from a judgment in which the trial judge held that the sale of farm land by the then 79 year old appellant was valid and that her solicitor in the transaction was not negligent. The appellant widow agreed to sell four quarters of farmland, including residence and some grain bins on the land, to the respondents by lease option agreement. The total price was $120,000. The terms were favourable to the purchasers, the monies being paid over years with most deferred until the final year. There was no interest. However, the appellant was permitted to reside in the house for her lifetime if she paid the utilities and the property taxes. The trial judge noted that the appellant resided on the land for years and there was no complaint made until the appellant's daughter, from whom the contract had been concealed by joint agreement between the appellant and the purchasers, found out what had happened. The sole issue on appeal was the applicable standard of review in H.L. v. Canada (Attorney General) [2005] 1 S.C.R. 401. HELD: Appeal dismissed. 1) There is no doubt that the central facts as found by the trial judge regarding the contract, the competence of the appellant and the relationship with and the conduct of the purchasers was supported by probative evidence. It is impossible for an appeal court to interfere with those findings, even if the Court had wished to. 2) With regard to the allegation of negligence against appellant's lawyer, contrary to what the appellant suggest, an independent meeting is not absolutely necessary for the solicitor to ensure comprehension of the contract. It is of course desirable, but the critical matter is for the solicitor to satisfy himself that the client comprehends the transaction. The trial judge found that the appellant understood all aspects of the contract. The matter of the timing of the private meeting between the appellant and her lawyer is not relevant, given that the appellant after the meeting continued to be prepared to enter into and perform the contract. If she had manifested some unease after she signed the agreement and then met with her lawyer but before the delivery of the contract to the purchasers, other issues and no doubt other evidence would have been considered in determining when the contract became effective in the circumstances. The claims against the appellant's solicitor are without a factual basis."
"Following a jury trial, the appellant was convicted of three drug offences and two Criminal Code driving offences. He was sentenced to 35 months in prison. Following a jury conviction, the applicant appealed his convictions and his sentence, arguing that the former were unreasonable and the latter was too severe. The appellant also argued that the trial judge erred in questioning whether the applicant could have outrun the police officer in the driving trial. HELD: Appeal dismissed orally.  1) The issues identified by the appellant do not operate to make his convictions unreasonable. The trial judge warned the jury about the dangers of eye witness identification evidence. She underscored that an honest and apparently convincing witness can be mistaken on identification issues. 2) When the charge is considered as a whole, the jury was not left with the impression that, if the applicant had been called, the trial officer would have had a better opportunity to see the driver of the white Tempo than the applicant. The jury was also not led to place particular reliance on an assessment of the applicant's credibility made by an RCMP officer who questioned him about possible involvement in the grow-op. The Court notes that R. v. Molsky, [2007] 1 W.W.R. 99, where the convictions turned exclusively on eye witness evidence, the convictions of the appellant and the sentence appeal were not unreasonable.","The RCMP conducted search of farmland near Canora. They were also shown pictures of the accused who was likely driving white Tempo. The search revealed marijuana grow-op. The accused was later seen by officers driving. The officers chased the Tempo for 41 kms, but the vehicle was driven into the ditch, and the driver escaped on foot. Four years later the accused was arrested in British Columbia and brought to trial. The accused was convicted of three drug offences and two driving offences following a jury trial. He was sentenced to a total of 35 months in prison. The accused appeal both the convictions and the sentence. HELD: The accused argued the convictions were unreasonable and not supported by the evidence. The grounds were: (a) the officer's eye witness identification evidence cannot support a conviction; (b) the trial judge made inappropriate comments about whether the accused could have outrun the officer at the end of the car chase, if he was the driver; (c) an adverse inference should been drawn from the Crown's failure to call the second officer; (d) the trial judge's treatment of the photographs of the accused misled the jury about what had to be proven to establish the accused was driving the Tempo; (e) the jury was improperly lead to place reliance on an assessment of a witness's credibility made by an officer who questioned him about his possible involvement in the grow-op. The Court found: (a) the jury was alerted to the frailties of the officer's identification evidence, and the convictions were not unreasonable in light of the evidence as a whole; (b) it was open to the jury to consider whether the accused could have outrun the officer, and the judge's caution about changes in physical condition over time put the issue into a proper perspective; (c) the judge told the jury that it could draw an adverse inference from the Crown's failure to call the second officer, but the decision lies with the jury and the judge is not obliged to tell the jury that it must draw the inference; (d) when the charge is considered as a whole, the jury was not left with the impression that if it concluded the pictures were of the accused that it somehow followed that he was the driver of the Tempo; (e) the judge's remarks did not improperly influence the jury's assessment of the witness's credibility. The imposed sentences fall within the standard range for similar offences and were not demonstrably unfit."
"The accused was charged with two counts of fraud. The Crown stayed the count and imposed a global sentence of eight years and six months. The accused plead guilty to three counts of theft. The sentences were varied to correspond to the gravity of the offence, the time actually served on remand. HELD: The global sentence was reduced to four years and nine months from the total of 10 years and 9 months. 1) The accused pled guilty to one count of conspiracy to defraud Saskatchewan Telecommunications of services and goods of a value exceeding $5,000 contrary to s. 380(1)(a) of the Criminal Code and one count for fraudulently obtaining goods and services by deceit, falsehood or other fraudulent means. 2) The offence was very high because of a number of aggravating circumstances. There clearly was pre-meditation and careful planning in advance. Several other people were implicated in the criminal enterprise. The two schemes were pursued over a lengthy period of time and involved scores of transactions. There were many individuals and businesses subjected to embarrassment and anxiety. 3) The Court gave the accused a credit for time served of 1,336 days for that period. 4) The credit was one for one, or put otherwise, the amount actually served by the accused. The credit should be one for both, or two, or less, and the global sentence should be reduced accordingly.  5) There was a credit of 4 years, 9 months and the credit remained with me despite s. 719(3) and (4). The discretion to grant the credit was with the Court despite s719(4) and(4), because the offences were committed and the charges brought before the enactment of the section.  6) The Crown did not meet the criteria for a fit global sentence as it had not satisfied the criteria set out in the Code. 7) Denunciation and deterrence, both of the accused and others, must be emphasized and obtain a priority. Any other approach would be counterproductive.","The accused plead guilty to one count of using credit card data to fraudulently obtain services contrary to s. 342(3) of the Criminal Code, one count of fraud over $5,000 contrary to s. 380(1) of the Criminal Code for defrauding Sasktel of telephone services and one count of fraudulently personating various persons with intent to gain advantage for himself contrary to s. 403(a) of the Criminal Code. The accused was incarcerated at the time that he committed the offences. The accused opened 52 false accounts with Sasktel, at times using names he obtained from obituaries and at other times using fictious names. He then used the accounts to obtain telephone services. The total loss to Sasktel was $25,915.44. The second scheme involved obtaining credit card information from people outside the prison, ordering goods via telephone to be delivered to third party and using the fraudulent credit cards to pay for the items. The total loss to the credit card companies was $22,695.18. The accused was 47 years old and had spent much of the last 30 years in jail. He had 121 prior convictions on his record, mostly for fraud, property related offences and non-compliance with court orders. In addition to the financial losses, huge amount of resources were expended to investigate the accused's activities. He plead guilty. HELD: A fit sentence in global terms for these offences would be 8 years and 6 months. The accused was given credit for 4 years and 9 months for the time he spent in custody. The accused was sentenced to 2 years and 3 months for the s. 342(3) offence, 1 year and 6 months consecutive for the offence under s. 380(1) and 2 years concurrent for the personation offence under s. 403(a). The Court gave the accused double credit for remand time that was the result of system delays, but imposed 1:1 credit for the 393 days of remand time that were attributable to the accused. The Court held that the high dollar value involved, the pre-meditation and planning involved, the lengthy period of time over which the accused committed the offences, the number of transactions involved and the fact that the accused committed these offences from prison were aggravating factors. In mitigation, the accused offered a guilty plea. The primary factors to be emphasized were denunciation and deterrence."
"A summary conviction appeal from a judgment wherein the learned Provincial Court judge convicted the appellant of impaired care and control of a motor vehicle while his blood alcohol content exceeded the legal limit of.08 contrary to s. 253(1)(a) of the Criminal Code. The grounds of appeal were that the learned trial judge erred in considering evidence that was not admissible on the impaired count, namely, that the appellant had been drinking, that he had bloodshot red eyes, his mouth appeared to be dry, he was rubbing his lips and he smacked his lips even when he was not talking and that, having worked with the appellant in the past, he had not been informed of his right to counsel when the tests were performed; and that observations concerning slurred speech while the appellant was detained and prior to being permitted to drive constituted an unsafe and/or dangerous verdict. HELD: The appeal was dismissed with costs. 1)The learned judge made express findings of credibility concerning the evidence of the two police officers who testified at the scene as to the appellant's level of intoxication. The learned judge did not resort to conjecture or speculation as suggested by the appellant. 2)Although the results of roadside sobriety tests are not an admissible evidence at trial as evidence of impairment, there is no inherent improbability in the observations concerning the impairment of the accused. The observations were corroborative of other symptoms of impairment that were noted by the police officers. 3)The appellant could say with his limited exposure that the accused had alcohol on his breath, bloodshot eyes, flushed face, and his speech was lacking in any detail and he was as well smacking his lips. There was some support for her testimony in other evidence which was accepted by the trial judge.","The appellant was convicted of impaired care and control and acquitted of a charge of care and control with a blood alcohol level exceeding .08 because of Charter violations. The appellant was senior member of the Saskatoon Police Force who was charged by members of his police force. The trial judge based his conviction on the evidence of two officers who testified that they observed signs of impairment including bloodshot, red eyes, flushed face, slurred speech, strong smell of alcohol on his breath and dry lips and mouth. In convicting the accused, the trial judge rejected the evidence of third officer who testified that the only sign of impairment he noted on scene was that the appellant had alcohol on his breath. The issues on appeal were whether the trial judge erred in his treatment of the evidence of the third officer, whether the trial judge erred in considering the observations of the other two officers as evidence to be admitted on the impaired driving count and whether the conviction for impaired driving was an unsafe verdict. HELD: The appeal was dismissed. The trial judge did not ignore or reject the evidence of the third officer. He provided extensive reasons why he preferred the evidence of the other two officers to the evidence of the third officer. The trial judge is in special position to assess the credibility of witnesses by being able to observe the witnesses as they testify and compare their observations to the testimony of the other witnesses. The findings of fact in regard to the testimony of the three police officers are supported by the transcript of their evidence and do not amount to conjecture of speculation. The trial judge made express findings of credibility with respect to the two officers and preferred their evidence to that of the third officer. There is no inherent improbability that would justify interference with the trial judge's findings on credibility. The appellant argued that the officer's evidence that the appellant had slurred speech should have been excluded because the trial judge excluded the actual statements made by the accused as violation of the accused's Charter rights under s. 10(b). Slurred speech is known physical indicator of impairment absent evidence of another cause. While statements made by an accused may not be introduced to prove impairment unless the accused has been advised of his Charter rights, physical manifestation such as slurred speech may be introduced to prove evidence of impairment. The appellant's argument that the verdict is unsafe or unreasonable was also rejected. The trial judge concluded that the Crown had proven beyond a reasonable doubt that there was evidence of impairment sufficient to meet the standard in R. v. Stellato. There was no palpable or overriding error in the verdict."
"HELD: The accused was charged with aggravated assault and common assault. The Court found that the accused’s actions were done in self-defence. Given that the video evidence and the testimony of corrections officers, it was not legally necessary to establish that the Crown had failed to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the injuries caused to the victim fell within the definition of wound, maim, disfigure or endanger life. The accused”s position in the trial was based on the concept of “parties to the offence”, “principal offender” and secondary offender. The three elements of s. 34(2) have both subjective and objective components: (1) the accused reasonably believed that he was assaulted; (2) that he caused the injuries to Dorion; (3) that his belief in himself was objectively reasonable on the basis of the situation that he perceives; and (4) that knife believed on reasonable grounds that he could not otherwise preserve himself from death or grievous bodily harm at the hands of Dorion. In all of the circumstances, the Crown established that bodily harm was objectively foreseeable by the accused as a consequence to the plot to which he was a party. The court reviewed the various pieces of evidence and concluded that the existence of an actual assault was not a prerequisite for the defence under s.34(2). All three elements must be established: the subjective perception of the accused, the objective foresight of specific wounds, and the fact that his group moved in unison with the purpose of attacking the victim.","In the evening, the accused inmate and his two co-accused inmates placed themselves in close proximity to the complainant inmate at table at the Penitentiary. The co-accused threw hot liquid from the cup directly into the complainant's face and the three inmates commenced stabbing the complainant with weapon. second complainant inmate attempted to intervene to assist the first complainant and the accused and co-accused began to stab the second complainant. The first complainant suffered severe first and second degree burns to his face and to his shoulders as well as numerous puncture wounds and lacerations but was not critically injured. The accused was charged with aggravated assault on the first complainant and common assault on the second complainant. None of the inmates testified at trial other than the accused. The accused testified that he felt he was being shunned in the Block and had received threats from the first complainant and others in the complainant's group who were brandishing shanks earlier that day. The defence argued that the Crown failed to prove that the injuries caused to the first complainant fell within the definition of 'wound, maim, disfigure or endanger life'; and that the acts done to the first and second complainants were in self-defence as contemplated by s. 34 of the Criminal Code. HELD: The accused was convicted of both counts. 1) In relation to the accused's defence of self-defence pursuant to s. 34(2) pertaining to the first complainant, the Court found the accused did not believe that he was being assaulted within the meaning of the law and, even if he did hold this belief, such a belief was not reasonable in the circumstances. Further, the Court did not accept, on a subjective or objective basis, that the accused reasonably believed that the first complainant had the present ability to carry out the threat, notwithstanding that the physical aspect of the assault need not be imminent or immediate. Lastly, the Court found that the accused did not believe that he had no other option. The accused admitted that he had other options but chose not to avail himself of them. 2) The Court found it did not need to assess the application of s. 37 of the Code in relation to the common assault charge. Rather, the Court found s. 27 of the Code applicable and determined that the second complainant was legally justified to use as much force as was reasonably necessary to prevent the commission of an offence which would be arrestable without warrant. The Court found the second complainant was clothed in legal justification and the accused was not entitled to the protection of s. 34(1) because the accused provoked the assault, and the force he used was more than necessary to defend himself as the accused was armed with a shank and the second complainant was not."
"The accused pleaded guilty to aggravated assault thereby endangering the life of a Metis youth contrary to s. 268(1) of the Criminal Code and failing to comply with a condition of a youth sentence that he report to his youth worker, contrary to the s. 137 of the Youth Criminal Justice Act. The Crown applied under section 42(9) for a determination that the aggravated assault be designated as a serious violent offence. The accused was sentenced to a secure custodial sentence of 24 months to be followed by a period of probation with credit for pre-sentence detention, 6 months of community supervision and 6 months community supervision. On the offences of breach of undertaking (including a weapons offence) and breach of probation (including breaching a promise to provide a DNA sample and a weapons prohibition), the sentence was increased to a total of 40 months, followed by 12 months of custody and community supervision (which would total 24 months). The accused will be permanently disabled by the time he is sentenced. The offence was committed in a secure facility and the accused did not oppose the Crown's application. HELD: The court sentenced the accused to 24 months imprisonment followed by 6 months probation. On each of the offences, the accused was given credit for an additional period of time (12 months) consisting of 12 months in closed custody followed by 1 year of probation. The sentence was adjusted to reflect the time spent in pre- sentencing detention and to include an additional 12 months for community supervision, which would total 40 months. The court designated the offence as a'serious violent offence' pursuant to s42(9). The young person will be significantly and permanently disabled.","The accused plead guilty to one count of aggravated assault, a breach of undertaking for failure to keep the peace and be of good behaviour and failing to comply with a condition of a youth sentence by failing to report to his youth worker. The victim came out of his house because he was concerned that someone was trying to damage his vehicle. The victim had baseball bat when he confronted the accused and group of young people. One of the accused's friends was pushed and fell backwards hitting his head. The accused said the victim hit him on the back with the bat. The accused got the bat and hit the victim five times in the head. The accused and another youth also kicked the victim while he was down. After the assault, the accused and his friends fled, leaving the victim in the alley. The victim suffered serious injuries including shattered jaw, every bone in his face was broken, his skull was fractured and he suffered brain bleed and lost teeth. He is also going to lose his eye, has memory loss and had to sell his business because he cannot work. The Crown applied to have the offence declared a serious violent offence and sought a sentence of 24 months, being 16 months secure custody followed by 8 months community supervision. At the time of the offence the accused was 17 years and months of age. He identified as Metis youth, but had no connection to cultural activities and claimed he had not been subjected to racism or poverty. His parents were separated. He was not attending school or working at the time of the offence. He had an extensive criminal record including 17 entries for compliance related convictions, previous property related convictions, for obstructing police offences and one for uttering threats. He had served five open custody sentences. HELD: The offence was declared a serious violent offence. The victim will be significantly and permanently disabled as a result of the offence and there can be no doubt that the accused caused intentional and grievous bodily harm to the victim. The court held that the egregious nature of the assault, serious harm done to the victim and the fact that the youth was subject to release conditions with respect to a weapons offence at the time he committed the assault were aggravating factors. In mitigation, the accused had entered a guilty plea, was cooperative with the police investigation, had done well in pre-sentence detention and had expressed remorse for his actions by submitting an apology letter to the court. The accused was sentenced to 24 months secure custody followed by 18 months probation. He was given 2:1 credit for the time he was on remand, leaving 18 months custody of closed custody to serve of which 12 months would be actual custody and 6 months would be community supervision. The court held that a lengthy custodial sentence was necessary to provide meaningful consequences and to achieve meaningful progress for the accused. A period of secure custody and supervision would give the accused access to psychological counselling and programming, an opportunity to work on his education and a chance to engage with support services in the community prior to release from custody. Given the accused's violent response in this case, it was clear that intensive programming is required."
"FIAT: The defendant seeks a stay of the action pursuant to s. 8 of The Arbitration Act, 1992. The plaintiff is a chartered accountant. He joined the partnership of MNP and became subject to the partnership agreement in 1999. The merger agreement provided the courts of Saskatchewan would have exclusive jurisdiction to determine all disputes and claims arising between the parties. The agreement provided that the parties would have sole jurisdiction to enter into new agreements upon the agreement's completion. The defendant applies for a stay in the action pending the completion of this arbitration proceeding. HELD: The action is stayed pursuant to the s.8(1) of the Arbitration act, 1992 for a cause of action that may result in the stay of this proceeding.  1) The Court cannot intervene in a cause-and-effect proceeding on the basis of the decisions made by the parties or the evidence of the arbitrator. 2) The arbitration agreement is invalid as it applies to the relationship of the parties and the subject matter of the dispute is not capable of being the subject of arbitration pursuant to Saskatchewan law. 3) The defendant is entitled to stay the action if the matter is in any way connected to the agreement or to the issues at issue.","The defendant seeks a stay of the action pursuant to s. 8 of The Arbitration Act. The plaintiff is chartered accountant who was partner with the defendant. 2000 merger agreement signed by the plaintiff indicated that the Courts of Saskatchewan would have exclusive jurisdiction to determine all disputes between the parties. After the merger, the plaintiff signed new partnership agreement that said arbitration would apply to any disputes between partner and the partnership. HELD: The action was stayed pending arbitration. The plaintiff's statement of claim does not rely on the 2000 merger agreement, the claim is based solely on the new partnership agreement and alleges breaches of the partnership agreement. The partnership agreement clearly states that disputes are to be resolved through arbitration."
"The proposed appellants applied to strike out the Chambers judge's Rule 173(c) order striking the within action on the basis that it was devoid of merit and lacked a common issue. They also opposed the certification of the within Action on the grounds that the relationship between them and the representative plaintiff was insufficient to found a recognized duty of care between a lawyer and non-client. The Chambers judge dismissed the application and certified the action as a class action against all defendants. The proposed appellant then applied pursuant to s. 8 of The Court of Appeal Act, 2000 for an order granting them leave to appeal from the certification order and his dismissal of their Rule 173 (c) application. They raised the following grounds in their proposed notice of appeal: 1) the Chambers lawyer erred in law in failing to apply the Ann's test; 2) the evidence before him was incomplete and conflicted in some respects; and 3) the tax opinions were not to be given to prospective investors. The Chamber judge made no errors in law. The tax opinions filed by the lawyer were found to be in the commonality standard applicable to all class actions; 4) the Chamber judge erred by failing to properly apply the Re: Collections Inc. v. Toronto Dominion Bank (CanLII), 2010 ONSC 602), and 5) the Court of Appeals would not have granted leave to further appeal on the same grounds as the Rule 173 application. The respondents also argued that the Chambers court erred when it did not apply the standard of care applied to the claim of negligence. They argued that there was no common issue upon which a recognized remedy could be administered, and that the reasons for the failure to apply that standard were secondary to the reasons the Chambers judges erred. The Court would not require the application of the common law test or the analysis by the Court in Re: Collection Inc. (CanlII), nor would it require an analysis by a Court of law or an analysis of the interplay between the different sub-committees of the Court that were examined.","The proposed appellants are some of the defendants in an action commenced by Schneider against them on the grounds that he, as representative plaintiff, and others suffered financial losses due to negligence on the part of McMillan. The representative plaintiff and other investors purchased 'cells' in gold exploration prospect owned and promoted by Royal Crown Gold Reserve Inc. based on that defendant's representation that the purchase price was deductible from the purchaser's earned income for income tax purposes and the tax opinions provided by McMillan. McMillan's opinion letters were posted on Royal Crown's website. The representative plaintiff purchased the cells and then filed tax returns claiming deduction, which was disallowed by the Canada Revenue Agency. The representative plaintiff commenced this action claiming that he and others suffered financial losses due to McMillan's negligence. McMillan applied to strike the statement of claim on the grounds that it was devoid of merit pursuant to Queen's Bench Rule 173(c) and opposed the certification of the action on the basis that the relationship between them and the representative plaintiff was insufficient to found a recognized duty of care between a lawyer and a non-client. Their application was supported by affidavits indicating that their tax opinions were not to be given to prospective investors. The plaintiff filed an affidavit from another lawyer, who deposed that when he prepared such opinion letters regarding tax consequences he reviewed all the underlying documents and agreements beforehand to protect the reputation of his law firm, knowing that the opinions were often relied upon as marketing tool to potential investors. The Chambers judge dismissed McMillan's application and it brought this application for leave to appeal under s. 8 of The Court of Appeal Act except as provided by s. 39(3) of The Class Actions Act. HELD: The Court dismissed the applications. It held that the Chambers judge was correct in holding that the action was not devoid of merit or vexatious. The judge had reviewed the affidavits and concluded that a lawyer may owe a duty of care to a non-client in specific circumstances, including those of this case. McMillan should have been aware of the use made by the mining industry of opinion letters and taken steps to prevent their opinion being used inappropriately for the purpose of inducing potential investors to invest with their client. The Court also found that the Chambers judge did not err in certifying the claim of negligence as a common issue that predominated over other issues affecting individual members of a class. McMillan's argument that the factual base pled by the representative plaintiff did not establish a common issue to meet the requirements of s. 6(1)(c) of The Class Actions Act failed because, in this case, the class members suffered real losses allegedly as a result of McMillan's negligence. These facts coupled with the case law stating that a lawyer may owe a duty of care to a non-client and the plaintiff's affiant's evidence, established a common issue that met the requirements of the Act."
"FIAT: The respondent seeks to expunge child support arrears that have accumulated as a result of his not paying child support for many years. He is 72 years old and practising internal medicine in the United States. He wants to expune the arrear from his wife, who is suffering from serious mental illness. HELD: 1) The respondent has not paid child support in the past 3 years. The wife, aged 63 years, is on long term disability. She is on a disability. 2) The husband has not been paying child care for 12 years. His arrearns have mounted considerably over the years. In some cases it might be appropriate to reduce them because of the passage of time. However, the respondent's pattern of non-payment is blameworthy. His child support obligations are still calculated using the income he actually earned. 3) The wife's application to exputge child care arreARS is dismissed. The husband will have a few lean years to pay off the arrenars. He will have to prepare for his retirement. 4) The petitioner has struggled for 25 years to get the respondent to pay child support. She was not successful at this time. She had to resort to welfare assistance. 5) The arrearing arreages are $183,746. The respondent's child support obligation under the 2001 order continued even though the respondent did not record it on its statement. The petitioner is on disability. The Court cannot find that the respondent does not have the ability to pay the arreaars. The arreaard arreards are the arrogars of the marriage. The parties cannot agree on the magnitude of the arredivables. The court cannot decide for the first time whether the arrow should be reduced or increased. The only conclusion drawn from the whole of the foregoing is that the petitioner's application is not unreasonable. The law as it pertains to imputed income has not changed. The fact that the husband has been paying support for 12 year periods and has not made an effort to reduce it all is a factor that is relevant to the decision. 5)' The petitioner's circumstances do not change. The father has not shown any hardship in the course of his life. The burden of proof is on him to prove his obligation. The past 3 year period has not included any significant change in his lifestyle. The current arreard ar","The parties had three children during their marriage. After the marriage ended in 1988, the husband respondent, medical specialist, moved from Moose Jaw to Ontario where his annual income was about $175,000. The children stayed with the petitioner wife in Moose Jaw. She was not able to work as registered nurse until she upgraded her education, which she slowly did as she could afford it. She and the children lived on very little income and relied upon social assistance because the respondent often did not pay child support. The parties were regularly in court. In 1994, the respondent left his position in Ontario and moved to Milwaukee, believing his prospects were better in the U.S. However, he lost his position in Milwaukee and opened his own clinic. His income dropped to as little as $15,000 in 2001. In this application, the respondent applied to vary two support orders, one made in 1998 and the other issued in 2001. He sought to expunge the arrears in respect of each and a declaration that the three children are no longer children of the marriage. His reason for seeking to have the arrears expunged was because he, now 72, wanted to retire in the next couple of years. The petitioner, 63, deeply in debt and on long-term disability, was still caring for one of their children because he suffers from schizophrenia. HELD: The Court held that two of the children had ceased to be children of the marriage as of 2002 and 2008 respectively. With respect to the third child, the Court found that as a result of the serious and long-term mental health problems suffered by him, he remained a child of the marriage. The Court then found that the respondent's arrears in respect of the 1998 child support order were $7,000. Based upon the respondent's imputed income of $109,000 per year established by the Court in its 2001 order, and the dates upon which the two children ceased to be so under the Divorce Act, the Court calculated the amount of child support owed by the respondent at $186,300. The Court rejected the respondent's argument that he could not afford to pay the arrears because his expenses left him with an income surplus of only $13,000. The Court discounted most of the claimed expenses and found that the respondent had $58,000 at his disposal and therefore had the ability to pay his arrears. The Court found that the respondent had chosen to minimize his earning capacity by staying in the U.S. in private practice and thus the respondent could not assert that the Court should use his actual income rather than his imputed income to vary the amount of child support he was ordered to pay in 2001. The undue hardship that the petitioner had suffered for 25 years constituted the most compelling reason for the Court to refuse to reduce or expunge the respondent's arrears. The application was dismissed and the respondent ordered to pay arrears and to pay child support in the amount of $927."
"The accused entered guilty plea to one count of driving a motor vehicle while her blood alcohol content was over 80 milligrams of alcohol in 100 millilitres of blood and asked to be granted a curative discharge pursuant to s. 255(5) of the Criminal Code. HELD: The Court found that the accused was in need of treatment to deal with her alcohol consumption and addiction. Based on the evidence, the Court concluded that the Court was satisfied that her case was the exceptional case contemplated in Ashberry and Ahenakew. A curative release would better serve the public interest than a fine or custodial sentence. Given the two prior convictions for drinking and driving, the accused's driver's licence was immediately cancelled and she was prohibited from driving on any street, road, highway or other public place for two years, commencing today.","HELD: The accused was granted a curative discharge. The court found that the accused had met the required onus of this type of application in accordance with R. v. Ahenakew. The accused’s conduct over the past 18 months satisfied the court on the balance of probabilities that hers was an exceptional case and that a curative discharge would not be contrary to the public interest. The court imposed numerous conditions on her, including that she could not have or consume alcohol and should report to a probation officer, receive addiction counselling, participate in AA meetings and provide proof of her attendance to her probation officer. Her driver’s license was cancelled and she was prohibited from driving for two years."
"The third party in this matter is the maternal grandmother of the two children. The grandmother seeks an order that she and the father have joint custody of the children but her home be the children's primary residence. HELD: 1) There is an interim order designating the grandmother as a person of sufficient interest on an interim basis. This designation was made pursuant to s. 6 of The Children’s Law Act, 1997 and is applicable when a family member pursues custody. Not only does the grandmother have a blood tie to the children, but the children have lived with her for the past seven years. The parties’ youngest son, Haydn, was born in September 2006. The mother and father lived together for 18 years. They moved to live with the grandmother in 2014. The father was granted interim custody in 2015. He sought an order for joint custody with the two boys. He argued that it would be in the children’ best interests to move from the primary care of the grandmother to his primary care. 2) The grandmother was found to have reasonable and liberal access with the children. There was no evidence that her access was sporadic prior to the death of the mother. It was clear that her use of alcohol and drugs was a factor in her decision to have the children share in an equal arrangement with the father. 3) There were no circumstances in which the grandmother could have served an application for contempt by obtaining a substitutional service on the grandmother.","HELD: The court found the following with respect to each issue: 1) the grandmother was a person of sufficient interest regarding the children pursuant to s. 6 of The Children’s Law Act, 1997 and had standing to bring her application for custody; 2) it would be in the best interests of the children, now aged ten and nine years of age, to have their primary residence with their grandmother as she was their psychological parent. They had resided with their grandmother for most of their lives and it was important to maintain their relationships with their school and friends. The respondent would have regular weekly parenting time with the children; and 3) the evidence was inadequate to consider child support."
