The original mortgage executed by the plaintiff was for $191,000 of which $176,000 was advanced to purchase her condominium and $15,000, eight per cent of the total, was advanced for other purchases. The property sold for $156,000 pursuant to a judicial sale. The sale proceeds were distributed to pay outstanding property taxes, commission, and the principal and interest due under the mortgage in the amount of $141,945 and the net sale proceeds were to be distributed pro rata. As at November 1, 2017, the principal and interest owing on the non-purchase money portion of the mortgage was $21,250. The plaintiff requested judgment for the deficiency in the amount of $9,900 with interest to the date of judgment. It claimed it was entitled to solicitor-client costs and other costs accrued by it under the mortgage. The issue was whether such costs should be subject to the pro rata calculation for the nonpurchase portion of the mortgage, that is, 8 percent of the total costs incurred.  HELD: The application was granted. The court found that the plaintiff was entitled to a deficiency judgment for principal and interest owed under the mortgage in the amount requested. It was also entitled to judgment against the mortgagee for eight percent of the solicitor-client costs, condominium fees and property management charges.","FIAT: Royal Bank of Canada applies by notice of application for a deficiency judgment against the defendant, Doreen Pearl Partridge, pertaining to the non-purchase money portion of the outstanding indebtedness to her mortgage. RBC also applies to have its lawyers' costs assessed on a solicitor-client basis. The issue is whether the pro rata distribution applies solely to the indebtedness of principal and accrued interest or applies to all costs under the mortgage. HELD: 1) Royal Bank is entitled to solicitor costs in the amount of $4,500.  2) The plaintiff applies for taxable disbursements of $121.47, non-taxable disbursement of $180.00 and the applicable GST and PST. The plaintiff also claims two other charges pursuant to its mortgage. First, RBC has paid to the condominium corporation the sum of $2,528.90 for arrears of condominium fees. Pursuant to s. 63 of The Condominium Property Act, 1993, SS 1993, C-26.1, the cond condominium fee paid by RBC are assessments levied against the mortgagor's land, are recoverable under the terms of the mortgage and any inspections and administration fees have not been claimed by the plaintiff. 3) RBC is awarded solicitor costs of $1,461.92 for its payment of property management charges for securing and caring for the property, appraisal fee and utilities. These charges are permitted by s. 8(1) of the LCRA. Any inspections are not claimed by The plaintiff. 4) The pro-rata calculation of the non‑purch money mortgage is 8% of the total outstanding mortgage amount and RBC was entitled to judgment against Partridge for $9,901.23 with interest from November 1, 2017 to the date of judgment at the rate of 2.79 per annum.  5) The Saskatchewan Court of Appeal in Walker was not required to address the prorating of solicitor costs because the parties had consented to having the matter remitted to the Queen's Bench judge. However, Walker is instructive in explaining the policy objective of s. 7 of The Limitation of Civil Rights Act (LCRA) and its policy objective. In this case, the pro- rata calculation applies to only that portion of a mortgage loan that was given to secure the purchase price of the land. It logically follows that the protection of s.(c) 8(c) ERA pertains only to those costs"
e_2016skca29.txt,"HELD: The majority of the court granted leave to appeal and restored the conviction entered by the trial judge. The parties and court agreed that the provisions of s. 34(1) as they read prior to May 2012 were applicable. The issues were determined as follows: 1) the appeal court judge erred by misunderstanding the applicable test and inappropriately focusing on the respondent’s belief. The appeal court judge reviewed cases that led him to focus on the doctrine of mistake of fact, which was not argued by the respondent at trial and were not part of his grounds of appeal; 2) the trial judge accepted some but not all of the expert’s evidence, as he was entitled to do. The trial judge also reinterpreted the video evidence, which was found to be an error by the Court of Appeal. The trial judge considered the factors without weighing the use of force to a nicety. He was determining the objective reasonableness of the force based on the factors; and 3) the appeal court judge properly instructed himself on the standard of review but failed to analyze the decision of the trial judge based on that standard, namely, whether the evidence was reasonably capable of supporting the trial judge’s conclusion based on the evidence as a whole. The dissenting judge would have granted leave to appeal but then would have dismissed the appeal. The dissenting judge of the Court of Appeal found that the appeal court judge erred in his approach but reached the right conclusion that the trial judge erred. The trial judge ignored the fact that the encounter was only three seconds long and he mischaracterized the thrust-kick as extreme force. The respondent had to react quickly. The trial judge also erred in questioning whether the respondent honestly believed he was in danger of harm.","The Crown appealed the conviction of Constable Power, who was charged and convicted in the Provincial Court of committing an assault causing bodily harm, pursuant to s. 267(b) of the Criminal Code. The summary conviction appeal court judge determined that the trial judge had erred in finding that the appellant had used more force than was necessary to either defend himself or effect the arrest of Mr. Stonechild under s. 25(1). The Crown applied for leave to appeal the decision of the Summary Conviction Appeal Court. HELD: The appeal was allowed and the conviction was entered in the provincial court. The conviction was reinstated. 1) The trial judge did not err in his assessment of the force used by the appellant. He did err in considering the nature and extent of the assault, the circumstances in which the appellant found himself and in the situation in which he found himself. 2) In assessing whether there is an air of reality to the proportionality requirement, that is whether the responsive force was no more than necessary in all of the circumstances, the judge instructed himself to disregard evidence of the Crown and the defence judge and to use an objective test to assess whether the appellant's belief in the use of force was reasonable. This is a modified objective inquiry and the principles to be applied are fundamentally the same for both provisions. In dealing with s. 34(1), the Crown must prove beyond a reasonable doubt that any one of these four elements is not present.  3) The defence of self-defence was founded on the principles of proportionality, necessity and reasonableness. It was common ground that the elements of a successful s. 29(1) defence were: 1) the subjective belief of a person who was in danger of harm and must be based upon reasonable grounds; 2) the evidence was properly taken into account in assessing the level of force used; 3) the judge properly balanced the factors in his analysis of whether the respondent's responsive force met or exceeded that which was objectively necessary; and 4) applying the correct standard of appellate review, the verdict was found to be guilty."
8_2012skpc79.txt,"The accused's neighbour disliked the accused and alleged that the accused drove his vehicle into hers. The police arrested the accused and found a fob that operated the locks on the doors of the vehicle and the engine hood of the accused's vehicle was warm. The accused was charged with hit and run and impaired driving. HELD: The Court found the accused not guilty of both charges. The Court found that the police breaches of the accused's Charter rights were numerous. The approximate 11 minutes of investigative detention was not an infringement of his rights but the combination of the officers' failing to inform the accused of the reason for his arrest and not giving his rights to counsel without delay, coupled with the illegal search and seizure of the fob and keys were in total breaches serious enough to bring the administration of justice into disrepute. The Court excluded the evidence of the fob and keys which further weakened the circumstantial case against the accused to the extent that the Crown failed to prove the accused was the operator of the motor vehicle.","HELD: The accused was found not guilty on both charges. The court excluded evidence of what followed pursuant to s. 24(2) of the Charter, except for the evidence of the fob and keys which were relevant to the defence of the accused's right to be free from an unreasonable search and seizure. The police had the requisite subjective and objective grounds to detain the accused for further investigation. However, an officer who detains for investigative purposes must inform the accused of the reason for his detention and must also inform him of his rights to counsel without delay. The exclusion of the evidence from what followed was a breach of the defence’s rights."
d_2013skqb90.txt,"The appellants appealed a small claims judgment. The judgment had found the appellants liable for damages after the respondent, who had purchased a house from the appellants, discovered that water was entering his basement. When the respondent investigated the source of the water, he removed the interior wall of the basement and discovered that there was a second wall behind the first one. He also discovered that a large chunk of the concrete footing and concrete grade beam were broken and had slid into the space between the interior basement wall. The respondent obtained a professional opinion that suggested that the problem had been there for a significant period of time and that the wooden beam that sat on the concrete grade beam was rotten and would have to be replaced. The respondent was awarded judgment in the amount of the repair. The appellant appealed on the basis that the trial judge should not have considered the respondent's expert's opinion about the age of the defect, that the trial judge had crossed a line in assisting the self-represented plaintiff at the trial and that the trial judge erred in calculating damages. HELD: The appeal was dismissed. The respondent's expert was qualified as an expert concerning foundation repair and had the necessary experience to give expert evidence on the type of structural repair and the need for structural repair. Once qualified as an expert in the area of foundations and structural repair, he could testify on the nature of the foundation's problems, including the wooden beam. The witness was also the person who actually carried out the repair to the foundation and was entitled to give evidence on what he saw and did. The witness was properly qualified by virtue of his years of experience and the trial judge was entitled to accept his evidence as to the state of the foundation and how long it had been in such a state. The trial judge's intervention and comments to the appellant's lawyer at the trial did not go beyond the nature of a legitimate attempt to ensure that all of the evidence regarding the matters at issue was before the Court with sufficient clarity to allow the trial judge to understand it. The cause of action in this case was negligent misrepresentation. The trial judge found that the appellants were aware of the structural defect and had covered it up. The proper measure of damages is the amount of money required to put the plaintiff in the position he would have occupied if the negligent misrepresentation had not been made. In this case, the judge made no palpable or overriding error in calculating damages at the amount it cost to fix the foundation.","This was an appeal from a Small Claims Court judgment dated August 20, 2012. The grounds of appeal listed in the notice of appeal are that the trial judge erred in weighing necessity and qualification before determining the admissibility of certain opinion evidence tendered on behalf of the plaintiff. The trial judge then awarded damages for repair of broken concrete grade beam and for other repairs in an amount much higher than damages would have been for the triple-ply beam, notwithstanding that liability as to the concrete Grade beam was not established at trial. HELD: This appeal is dismissed with costs of the appeal to the respondent. 1) In this case, had the state of the foundation and/or the wooden beam not been covered by the interior wall built by the Richardsons, the defect in the foundation, which included not only the rotten wooden beam but also the cracks in the ground, could have been discovered by the respondent or his property inspector. The respondent may then have elected not to proceed with the purchase contract or alternatively remedied the defect before the wall collapsed inward. There is no evidence that the amount of work done was not necessary to repair the damage done when the foundation caved in and water entered the basement. 2) In the case of Kitzul v. Ungar, [1991] SCC 45 (CanLII), the court reviewed the law regarding trial unfairness in the civil context. It is clear from the case law that trial judges do not rest mute. They are entitled to seek appropriate clarification and give direction and, in certain cases, disclose tentative conclusions as means of ensuring proper understanding of the case. These questions are to be answered upon an examination of the proceedings as a whole."
4_1994canlii4625.txt,"At trial in Provincial Court, the accuseds called no evidence and were convicted. They appealed on the basis that the Crown's evidence was so insufficient that a verdict of guilty was unreasonable or was one which could not reasonably be supported on the evidence. HELD: Appeal dismissed. 1)No medical evidence was necessary to establish that the victim's injuries were caused by an assault, given the photographs admitted into evidence, the evidence of the police officer who was called to the scene of the assault and the evidence of the 7-11 clerk who was first approached by the victim for assistance. 2)Evidence of exclusive opportunity was unnecessary to sustain a conviction where there was other circumstantial evidence pointing to the identity of the accuseds. 3)Although a failure to permit an accused who calls no evidence to argue last in a jury trial might be a good ground of appeal, the failure to be permitted to argue last before a judge alone was merely a procedural error which could be cured under the curative provision contained in S.686(1)(b)(iv) of the Criminal Code.","Appeal from Provincial Court. The question was whether the evidence adduced by the Crown - the defence called no evidence - was insufficient to such a degree that a trial judge's verdict of guilty ought to be found by this Court either unreasonable or one that cannot be supported by the evidence. HELD: Appeal dismissed. 1)The procedural point raised by the appellants had no merit. It was readily resolved by examining the circumstances immediately preceding the infliction of the injuries by looking at the photographs of the victim taken the following day by the opinions of both the counterman at the 7-Eleven store who saw the victim shortly after the injuries were inflicted and called the police, and of the investigating officer who saw him shortly after that. 2)There was sufficient evidence for the trial judge to reach a conclusion respecting the cause of the injury beyond a reasonable doubt without resorting to medical opinion. On the question of identity, it is true that there was no direct evidence to implicate either party. There was, however, strong circumstantial evidence. It is fair to infer that the victim received his injuries at the spot where the pool of blood was found. However, the evidence contained in the procedural argument was not sufficient to present a reasonable verdict. 3)The 'other inculpatory evidence' of motive and hostility, put the present case into the category of one where'something less than exclusive opportunity may suffice'. In either case the Circumstantial evidence of opportunity is sufficient to sustain a finding of identity beyond areasonable doubt. 4)The Court of Appeal dismissed the argument without a substantive curbing of the entitlement to address a jury in the traditional sense without a traditional curative error of law."
c_1993canlii4474.txt,"The parties lived together for 14 years and had three children, aged eight, 13 and 14. The petitioner always worked and eventually became a successful stockbroker. The respondent was employed part-time doing minimum wage jobs and was responsible for the household duties and raising their children. The petitioner's annual income was $50,000 at the time of separation, but escalated to $200,000 in 1992 and was prone to great fluctuation. The respondent was to have custody of the children. She sought spousal and child support and an unequal division of assets. Ordering support and an unequal division of assets. The court extensively reviewed the case of Moge v. Moge (1992), 43 R.F.L.(3d) 345 (S.C.C.) and found that marriage and child care responsibilities hinder a wife's role in the workplace. The court awarded $4500 per month as spousal and child support, plus an additional $500 while the wife retrained. The court considered this an appropriate case for an unequal division of matrimonial assets in the respondent's favour. Finding that the awards were still not sufficient to satisfy the respondent's needs, a lump sum award of $18,000 was ordered. On appeal.","The parties, along with their mother, decided to buy and operate a coffee and donut franchise. The mother was the primary caregiver, to perform the major part of the homemaking chores and to supplement the family finances by employment. The father sought an unequal division of matrimonial assets and liabilities, seeking an order specifying the terms and conditions of a deferred deferral of interest rate or return on investment. The wife was awarded reasonable scheduled access. The court was satisfied that the ground had been proven and granted the petition for divorce. There was no possibility of reconciliation between the parties. The trial judge was left with the task of determining the effect of the marriage in impairing or improving each spouse's future economic prospects and attempting to achieve an equitable sharing of economic consequences."
9_2011skqb49.txt,The applicant was a student at the University of Saskatchewan in the College of Medicine. He was required to discontinue his studies for failure to meet academic standards for promotion. The applicant appealed his dismissal and was unsuccessful throughout. He applied to the Court for an order of certiorari to quash the decision of the Academic Appeals Committee and the University Bylaws Committee Council and an order reinstating him as a student at the College of Medicine pending resolution of his appeal. HELD: The Court found that the Bylaws Committee Council exceeded its jurisdiction by reviewing the previous decisions made and drawing the conclusion that they were made fairly and properly. The Bylaw Committee determined the merits of the applicant's appeal and determined that it was not necessary to convene a full appeal board. There is nothing in the University policy to suggest that the Bylaws Committee has that power. The Bylaws Committee has exceeded its jurisdiction in this regard and its decision is quashed. The matter is returned to the Bylaws Committee to determine whether the applicant's appeal falls within the policy on student appeals and academic matters. The portion of the application requesting reinstatement of the applicant as a student pending the resolution of his appeal is dismissed. The applicant has a marginal academic record and there are a limited number of placements in the College of Medicine. It does not make sense to displace another student or require the College of Medicine to train a marginal student on a potentially temporary basis.,"The applicant was required to discontinue his studies for failure to meet the academic standards for promotion. He applied to quash a decision of the Academic Appeals Committee of the College of Medicine and of the University Bylaws Committee of Council. HELD: The certiorari application was dismissed. The applicant was unsuccessful in all of the appeals. The purpose of the appeal was to determine whether or not an appeal fell within para.1(a) of the policy. It was not appropriate however for the Court to usurp the function of the Bylaw Committee and review the material to determine if in opinion, the matter should be remitted to the appeal board under Part V, para.3(3). The matter was returned to the appellant's Committee for a decision according to law that is whether the applicant's appeal falls within Part VI, the policy on student appeals and academic matters. 1) There is nothing in the policy to suggest the Committee has such power. The appeal was referred to as a vetting step and of course no need for the establishment of an appeal board. 2) The Court was not satisfied this was appropriate in these circumstances. There was no precedent for this type of intervention by the Committee in the past. The Committee has exceeded its jurisdiction in this regard and its decision is therefore quashed."
8_1994canlii4691.txt,"The landlord applied for possession of residential premises after his tenants refused to vacate in response to a written notice to vacate. The deputy rentalsman ordered that the landlord should have possession, but also ordered that the last two months rent would abate in order to assist the tenants with their moving costs. The landlord appealed the abatement of rent and a chambers judge reversed the deputy rentalsman. The tenants sought and were granted leave to appeal the chambers judge and this appeal resulted. HELD: Appeal allowed. 1)The chambers judge could only reverse the deputy rentalsman if he exceeded his jurisdiction or erred in law. 2)The deputy rentalsman had jurisdiction to order an abatement of rent pursuant to S.47(4) of the Act. 3)The jurisdiction is a discretionary one. The court will therefore show some deference to a decision of the rentalsman involving this jurisdiction. In this case the deputy rentalsman made no reversible error.","The issues in this case began long before the notice of termination of tenancy (which ultimately prompted this Court's involvement) and stem from a number of complaints made by both the tenants and the landlord. The landlord began leasing his premises to the tenants in August 1994. The tenants applied first to the Rentalsman's Office for an order directing the landlord to remove a stove, replace a refrigerator and make appropriate repairs to floor tiles, fence and gate. The deputy rentalsman heard the tenants' complaints and had access to the landlord's written judgment. He then heard the tenant's application for possession and made a decision which the landlord appealed. The Deputy rentalsman's decision to abate rent was therefore appealed. Appeal allowed and the decision of the rentalsman restored. As neither the landlord nor the tenant was represented by counsel, there was no order as to costs."
c_1993canlii5621.txt,"The appellant was convicted of sexually touching a young girl who was under the age of 14. He contended the trial judge erred by permitting the complainant to testify behind a screen without first conducting a voir dire and by relying on Crown's submission the girl would be uncomfortable without the screen. As well, he argued the judge improperly permitted the complainant to read a statement given to the police, to refresh her memory during cross-examination. Dismissing the appeal, that the fairness of the trial was in no way impaired by use of the screen, and no miscarriage of justice occurred. The statement was given the complainant by defence counsel, who suggested she read v.

HELD: Appeal dismissed. 1)The legislation provides for an appeal to the Court of Queen's Bench and for no further appeal. Such an appeal can be taken on the following grounds: (a)the committee exceeded its jurisdiction; (b)it failed to observe the rules of natural justice; (c)it made an error of law; (d)its findings can not be reasonably supported by the evidence which it was entitled to consider. 2) The Court found no error of jurisdiction or failure to observe the rules of natural justice. 3)The Court found no palpable or overriding error in the facts as determined by the Committee based on the evidence.",A medical doctor has been reassessed and ordered to repay money for billings already received as a result of services provided to patients. The Saskatchewan Medical Care Insurance Act provides that a physicianaggrieved by an order of the joint medical professional reviewcommittee may appeal to a judge of the Court of Queen's Bench. There is no further right of appeal. The medical doctor's practice is unique in nature because he did not have hospital privileges. This coupled with his philosophy of treatment (i.e. he attempts to have his patients modify their lifestyle) requires that he administer many more tests to monitor his treatment program and he also has more frequent contact with his patients. This is extreme departures from the group mean. HELD: The Committee's decision should be set aside on the merits. 1)There was insufficient evidence before the Committee to constitute proof that the physician's delivery of medical services was unacceptable from a medical perspective. The Committee only had before it the evidence of Huerto that his approach was medically acceptable. 2)The Committee did not commit any palpable and over-riding error. There was evidence to support its conclusion that the Committee committed an error of law. 3)It did not exceed its jurisdiction in undertaking the review of the billing pattern of the medical doctor. 4)No error was made. 5)Costs were recovered by the Committee.
9_2010skqb122.txt,"FIAT: This is an application for an order pursuant to s. 63(2) of The Personal Property Security Act requiring the respondents or those in possession to deliver to the applicant four pieces of construction equipment. The four pieces of equipment were rented by applicant, Inland, to respondents, Mike Dery Holdings Ltd. and Giants Head Excavating Ltd. pursuant to an equipment rental contract entered into at Penticton, British Columbia, between April 21, 2008 and August 6, 2008. Inland did not register any security interest in the equipment in British Columbia or Saskatchewan until October 20, 2009. In the fall of 2008, the equipment was transported to Saskatchewan by Mike Dery Holdings Ltd. and/or Giants Head. In February of 2009, respondent 101138096 purchased the equipment from Mike Dery Holdings Ltd. and Giants Head for valuable consideration. Searches were completed to establish no registrations against the equipment. In April of 2009, the equipment was leased to Giants Head and a security agreement registered in Saskatchewan on May 5, 2009 listing the equipment as general property but not specifically registering the equipment by serial number. The security agreement was taken by 101138096 to secure the rental payments owed to it under the lease by Giants Head who had possession of the equipment. Mike Dery Holdings Ltd. and Giants Head defaulted under their payments to Inland and Giants Head defaulted in its payments to 101138096. September 18, 2009, 101138096 seized the equipment leaving it in the possession of Giants Head. The equipment was subsequently removed from Giants Head's possession and stored at the farm of Bruce Bakken. On October 19, 2009, 101138096 forwarded a letter to Giants Head confirming that 101138096 had elected to retain the equipment as payment for the outstanding indebtedness. As of this date a Personal Property Security registry search in Saskatchewan disclosed no security interest other than that of 101138096 in the equipment. Inland subsequently registered both a British Columbia and Saskatchewan Personal Property registry interest by serial number respecting the equipment and its original agreements of 2008. The issue before the Court is whether Inland by virtue of its Personal Property Security registration by serial number on October 20, 2009 has priority over the interest of 101138096 which registered earlier as general security without serial numbers but who alleges to have taken possession of the equipment and elected to retain the equipment seized in satisfaction of Giants Head's indebtedness October 19, 2009. This occurred one day prior to the registration of the security interest by serial number of Inland. HELD: The application is dismissed with costs to the respondents. The respondent 101138096 had a general security registered and had actual possession of the equipment in early October 2009 which therefore perfected its security while it retained possession. As of October 19, 2009 when 101138096 elected to take the collateral as satisfaction of the debt the only party to whom notice was required was the debtor Giants Head and his notice is in compliance with s. 61(1) and s. 61(3) of the Act. When the applicant completed its registration on October 20, 2009 the collateral was no longer available because of 101138096's election on October 19, 2009. The respondent perfected its security interest in the equipment which is subject to this application by taking possession thereof. Electing to take the collateral as satisfaction of the obligation secured and providing the required notices prior to registration by the applicant, transferred title to the equipment to the respondent 101138096 free and clear of the claim of the applicant.","FIAT: This is an application by Inland for an order pursuant to s. 63(2) of The Personal Property Security Act, 1993.

The parties married in 1974 and divorced in 1992. They agreed to joint custody of their two children in their 1991 separation agreement. One child was expected to graduate in 2002 and the other in 2003. The father said he suffered depression and was unemployed for several years. HELD: Arrears from 1993 were eliminated. He paid 39, 9 and 0% of the required support in 1994, 1995 and 1996 when his income dropped. He paid 5% in 1997, 66 in 1998 and 117% in 1999. Any ongoing obligation was terminated in view of the mother's letter to the Alberta Maintenance Enforcement Office and her representations to the court that she was no longer seeking support.","The husband applied to vary the court's maintenance order from January 12, 1993 to the present by eliminating any further obligation to pay maintenance for his children.

This agreement was confirmed in September 1992. At the time of the agreement, the husband earned $48,000 and by 1993 the first year in which he was required to pay a total of $4,200 his income was only 42% of his 1992 income. However, he actually paid little in excess of his required payment that year and paid substantially more than his original obligation."
b_1996canlii6818.txt,"At issue was the determination of the quantum of spousal and child support and division of matrimonial property. HELD: 1)The respondent's supplementary allowances were taken into consideration in finding a gross salary of $53,000.00 per annum. Due to an injury he was no longer able to work overtime but was working full-time. Should a medical discharge become necessary an application to vary can be brought at that time. 2)The petitioner suffered a substantial economic disadvantage. The frequent moves due to the husband's employment had disrupted the petitioner's employment and university education. However, the court must also take into consideration the economic advantage enjoyed as a result of the marriage including the pension plan of the spouse. 3)If the petitioner did receive the greater share of the household goods it can be attributed to partial compensation for her economic disadvantage. Shares in joint names were divided equally. Other assets were divided equally. 4)Upon the granting of the divorce the petitioner will be disqualified from receiving the pension survivorship benefits. The fair solution was to use the enhanced value of the 'With Survivorship Benefits' column and the date of adjudication was used as the valuation date. The combination method of valuation was used in view of the 15 year marriage and given the economic disadvantage suffered by the petitioner. 5)The parties agreed that child support should be set in accordance with the Federal/Provincial/Territorial guidelines based on the respondent's gross yearly income. $600.00 per month per child was awarded.  6)The court must seek to promote the economic self-sufficiency of each spouse. The petitioner's future plans were realistic. $800 per month until June 1, 2001 was awarded for spousal support.  7)Costs including one-half of the cost of preparing reports and pension valuations were awarded to the petitioner.","The parties were agreed on their divorce based on their separation in excess of 1 year and that Mary be granted custody of the children with reasonable access to John upon reasonable notice. There remains for determination the quantum ofmaintenance for the children, spousal maintenance and the division of matrimonial property. HELD: 1)The parties agreed that the amount of the maintenance should be based on the Federal/Provincial/Territorial Family Law Committee's report and Recommendations on Child Support. 2)The reasonable and realistic figure to use for the determination of maintenance was a gross salary of $53,000 per annum. If indeed Mary did receive the greater share of the pension, it could be attributed to partial compensation for her economic disadvantage. However, fairness and equity required a combination of both approaches to be used. 3)The evidence showed that somewhere in between (preferably the mid-point) the termination and retirement method was the route to go."

3_1999canlii12362.txt,"The appellant appeals his conviction of sexual assault causing bodily harm on the ground the trial judge erred in preventing cross-examination of the complainant. The trial judge prevented the cross-examination of the complainant in relation to a previous allegation she had made relating to this sexual assault. The offence is alleged to have taken place at home of the appellant's brother. The appellant was asked by his brother and sister-in-law to babysit their daughter. The allegation was that the appellant had entered her parent's bedroom where she was sleeping and sexually assaulted her. The appellant, who has no previous record, was convicted of the charge and sentenced to three years imprisonment. The appellant during cross-examination of the complainant attempted to question her regarding a previous allegation regarding the same sexual assault against another person. The trial judge did not permit this line of questioning as he held it pertained to her past sexual history. HELD: Appeal allowed. The failure of the trial judge to allow this cross-examination has prevented the appellant from having a fair trial as he has been denied the opportunity to make full answer and defence. It seems the question that should have been put to the trial judge on this occasion was whether this section was applicable to a situation involving non-consensual sex. The complainant was not being questioned about her consensual sexual activities but rather a previous complainant of a sexual assault. It is understood the intent was to indicate the complainant had implicated someone else as the assailant and after investigation the complaint had not been acted upon. That evidence could have placed in doubt the reliability of the complainant's identification of the person who assaulted her since the room was dark when the assault was alleged to have occurred. The relevance of such a question pertaining to the existence of another complaint made by the complainant in respect of the same assault is obvious. That question has a direct bearing on her credibility.","The appellant was found guilty of having sexually assaulted the complainant contrary to s. 272(c) of the Criminal Code. He appealed the conviction on the ground that the trial judge erroneously interpreted s. 276 of the Code to prevent proper cross-examination of the complainant in relation to a previous allegation she had made relating to this sexual assault. HELD: The appeal was allowed and a new trial ordered. 1)The trial judge failed to consider that the complainant was not being questioned about her consensual sexual activities but rather about a previous complaint of a sexual assault which was understood to have been made about another man. It is understood the intent was to indicate the complaintant had implicated someone else as the assailant and after investigation the complaint had not been acted upon. 2)The relevance of such a question pertaining to the existence of another complaint in respect of the same assault was obvious. It does not raise the issue of whether the complainant has 'engaged in sexual activity'. That question had a direct bearing on her credibility.  3)The appellant had been denied the opportunity to make full answer and defence. The trial judge should have been directed to allow the complainant to respond to the question, not so as to permit an assessment of her previous sexual conduct, but to clarify what previous complaint she may have made about this alleged assault."

That date was found to be earlier than the one set out in s. 228, one of the Act's transitional provisions which deals with injuries between March 23, 1990 and February 1, 1996 (the 'window period'). The appeal was dismissed as the substance of the appeal did not restrict the benefits to an effective date. The November 26, 1992 date was one choices (sic) under that section for when the recalculated award is to take effect. As there is no recalculation in this case, s 228 does not apply."
6_2001canlii365.txt,"The accused was charged with impaired driving (Criminal Code ss.255(1) and 253(a)) and with operating a motor vehicle while having a blood alcohol concentration exceeding .08 (Criminal Code ss.253(b) and 255(1)). Issues included whether the Court should enter a stay of proceedings and award costs, given the failure of the Crown to produce a standard alcohol solution (SAS); could mouth alcohol have invalidated the roadside screening test; did the arresting officer have reasonable and probable grounds to demand a breath sample; was the accused denied his right to counsel; was the breathalyzer test administered as soon as practicable; was there evidence to the contrary? HELD: The accused was found not guilty on count #2 (exceeding .08). Count #1 (impaired driving) was dismissed during the trial.  1)The court was cognizant of the burden of proof and had reviewed the decision of R. v. Lifchus concerning reasonable doubt. 2)The accused's testimony was rejected as not being credible. 3)The burden lies with the applicant on an application pursuant to ss.7 and 24(1) of the Charter in which the defence alleges the accused's right to make full answer and defence has been infringed. The question remained whether once the defence established it sought the SAS but it was not provided for whatever reason, had it discharged its burden or must it prove the failure to produce the SAS solution could have a meaningful outcome on the trial. 4)The accused's s.7 Charter right to make full answer and defence was infringed by the failure of the Crown to produce a sample of the SAS solution in this case. In light of the Bourget and Kalafut decisions, the Crown has had ample opportunity to establish a system for routinely saving the solution until after a case has been concluded. It would bring the administration of justice into disrepute were the Certificate of Analysis admitted into evidence. It was more appropriate to exclude the Certificate of Analysis than to grant a stay of proceedings.  5)Costs are rarely awarded in criminal proceedings. Given the evidence presented concerning the usefulness of testing a representative SAS ampule had it been produced, the court was not persuaded costs should be awarded. 6)There was no evidence that created a reasonable doubt as to the time that elapsed or that there may have been mouth alcohol which may have invalidated the roadside screening test. Both the subjective and objective tests were met. The arresting officer, who has no reason to believe an accused has consumed alcohol in the last 15 minutes, may administer the roadside screening test without delay, but to do so carries with it a certain risk that there may be subsequently evidence which will invalidate the results (affecting the objective element of the test). Further, the officer has no duty to routinely wait 15 minutes before administering the test nor to ask the accused whether or not alcohol has been consumed in the preceding 15 minutes. However, if there are circumstances which suggest the officer should have waited or inquired about alcohol consumption, this may affect the reasonableness of the officer's belief (the subjective test). 7)There was nothing in the evidence to support the submission that the speedometers need to be checked to support the officer's evidence. The officer was acting in the lawful execution of his duty in stopping the accused's vehicle. While doing so he detected an odour of alcohol on the accused's breath which gave rise to the demand for a roadside screening. 8)The informational component of the right to counsel was satisfied. There was no evidence the accused misunderstood his right nor that he was not given sufficient opportunity to contact counsel. He declined twice, giving a clear and unequivocal waiver. Absent special circumstance, the police cannot be expected to draw information out of the accused. 9)The samples were taken as soon as practicable. It was accepted that there was typically no one available at the detachment in the small community and was sufficient reason to not consider attending there given the proximity of the city. The officer tried the closest detachment but found no one there. It may have been more important to question the judgment of the officer to return to the Saskatoon detachment if the delay had been more significant. On the face of it, the delay of 27 minutes did not seem unreasonable. 10)The statutory presumption applied. There was no evidence to the contrary as the accused's evidence was rejected. The court reviewed R. v. Gibson and considered s.258(1)(c) and (d.1) of the Criminal Code.","The accused was charged with impaired driving and operating a motor vehicle while over.08 contrary to s. 255(1) and s. 253(a) of the Criminal Code. The accused was stopped by the RCMP at 1:40 a.m. when he observed the accused driving his vehicle 70 km per hour in 40 km zone. Upon arriving at the RCMP detachment, the officer noted a distinct smell of liquor and redness in the accused's eyes. He asked the officer if he wished to contact a lawyer and he said that he didn't wish to. The officer made the demand because the accused failed the roadside screening. As result, he believed that the Accused's ability to drive was legally impaired by alcohol (B.P.A.). The officer advised that he preferred that someone else administer the test when he is the arresting officer and he did not go to Martensville or Warman as he has found that there is rarely anyone at either location or in any case anyone who can administer test. HELD: The application was dismissed.  1) The accused's evidence was straightforward and reliable. There was no one reason for the failure to produce the standard alcohol solution as requested by the defence. 2) The defence had no restriction on its decision, albeit the facts concerned what the Court of Appeal described as 'live issue'. The essence of the Crown's case is the results of the analyses of the breath samples of the accused, which results are obtained from a breathalyzer machine. It is obvious that such a machine cannot be subjected to cross-examination and that its veracity will never be in question. However, it does not follow that its accuracy is immune from attack. An integral component of any analysis is the solution contained in the ampoules. If the solution is deficient it will produce an inaccurate reading. The only way in which the defence can satisfy itself as to the suitability of the solution and be sure of its truth, rather than suppression, should be the starting point."" With respect to the right to counsel, the accused stated that he understood after each demand was read that it could be expected that the officer would wait 15 or 20 minutes to allow any mouth alcohol to dissipate before administering the breathalyser. He denied being told the policy manual states that they should wait 15 to 20 minutes. He did not explain why he would make these utterances, if he was considering whether to call a lawyer or not, but gave an answer when asked if he could call a number other than the telephone number."
3_1991canlii4569.txt,"The appellant appealed his conviction for sexual assault using a weapon and his sentence of eight years. The appellant contended that his counsel had failed to call the complainant's boyfriend as a witness even though he was in the courthouse under a defence subpoena. The appellant also raised on appeal the fact that he had lost his right to a jury trial. He had failed to appear at the jury trial scheduled and a bench warrant had been issued. The Crown had then applied for an order that the appellant was no longer entitled to a jury trial and the record showed that his counsel had agreed to forfeit the right to a jury trial. The appellant contended that his counsel and the Crown both advised him he had lost his right by failing to appear and that he was not told that he could avoid losing his right if he had a legitimate excuse for failing to appear. He put forth the excuse of having had no counsel at the time of the trial. Dismissing the appeal, (1) that there was nothing to show that the witness would have given relevant evidence bearing on a decisive issue in the trial and the appellant failed to meet the burden of showing that the evidence, if believed, could reasonably have been expected to affect the result of the trial when considered with all the other evidence; counsel's decision not to call the witness where the witness was hostile and counsel did not know what he would say was not inappropriate, and, the court noted, in the circumstances, seemed to have been the right decision; (2) the excuse of failing to appear because he did not have counsel was not a legitimate excuse within the meaning of s. 598(1)(a) of the Criminal Code; moreover, the appellant only raised this issue in his oral submissions and gave no notice to the Crown respecting this issue nor did he provide any supporting evidence by way of affidavit; it was seen by the Court as another unsupported and unjustified criticism of counsel and the Court concluded that the record showed that the appellant had agreed to forfeit his right to a jury trial; and (3) that an eight year sentence, although at the high end of the scale for sexual assault, was not manifestly excessive, having regard to deterrence, the circumstances of the offence, and the appellant's record which included three minor offences.","The appellant was convicted after trial of using a weapon in a sexual assault contrary to s. 246.2 of the Criminal Code. He now applies for leave to appeal against the sentence of 8 years imprisonment and a firearms prohibition order made by the trial judge. Allowing the appeal and allowing the appeal, that the appellant had failed to show that the complainant's evidence would be reasonably capable of believing and in addition, that his evidence could reasonably be expected to affect the result of the trial."
b_1995canlii6027.txt,"The accused appealed her conviction on a charge of impaired driving. The grounds of her appeal were that the trial judge erred in determining that she was impaired, and that the trial judge otherwise misconstrued and misapplied the evidence. HELD: Appeal dismissed.  1)Both grounds of appeal raised questions of fact. Findings of fact are not to be reversed on appeal unless it can be established that the trial judge has made some palpable and overriding error which affected her assessment of the facts. 2)The Court's task is not to retry the case or substitute its own decision. A trial judge's findings of fact can only be overturned if they are so clearly wrong as to make the decision unreasonable. 3)The Court was unable to say that an error of that kind was made by the trial judge in this case.","The appellant appealed her 1993 conviction for operating a motor vehicle while impaired contrary to s. 253(a) of the Criminal Code. The conviction was contrary to the law, the evidence and weight of the evidence; the learned trial judge made an error in law in determining the degree of impairment by alcohol or drug required before aconviction could be entered. HELD: The appeal was dismissed. 1)There was no palpable error of fact on the trial judge's part. Findings of fact are not made with respect to this kind of assessment unless and until an independent investigation is made. 2)The trial judge was unable to say beyond any reasonable doubt that A.

4_2009skca44.txt,"The respondent Homeowners sued the respondents Sebastian and the TWC alleging negligence or breach of contract for failing to obtain the coverage for insurance as instructed by the Homeowners. Sebastian and TWC issued a third party claim against the appellant SGI and claimed SGI was negligent or in breach of contract or contributory negligence pursuant to the Contributory Negligence Act for failing to issue a policy of insurance in accordance with the application submitted to SGI by Sebastian on behalf of the Homeowners. The trial judge concluded Sebastian and TWC were negligent and liable for the loss suffered by the Homeowners. Further, the trial judge concluded that the insurer, SGI, owed a duty of care to both Sebastian and TWC and the Homeowners to properly underwrite and deal with the application for insurance. The trial judge concluded SGI contributed equally to the Homeowners' loss by 'their negligent acts' and was responsible to pay 50% of the judgment. The negligence of Sebastian and TWC is not disputed in this appeal. The Homeowners have been paid the amount owed under the judgment and advised they have no interest in the matter and did not participate in the appeal. SGI appeals and submits the trial judge erred in determining that SGI: (a) owed a duty of care to the insureds, Homeowners, and to the broker when it received an application for insurance in 'all the circumstances'; and (b) breached its duty of care. HELD: That portion of the judgment finding that SGI is liable for 50% of the damages payable to the Homeowners is set aside and the Third Party Claim is dismissed. Accordingly, the appeal is allowed with costs to the Appellant. The trial judge correctly placed the duty of care on the intermediary, Sebastian. It is clear the insurer relies on the broker to apply for the coverage in accordance with his clients' (i.e., the insureds') wishes and needs. There was no other evidence before the Court to establish the standard of care, the basis for imposing a duty at law where none has previously existed, or the subsequent breach of that duty by the insurer, SGI, in connection to the application for insurance submitted by Sebastian. The Court concluded there was nothing in this transaction which warrants the creation of a duty of care owed by the insurer to a broker applying for insurance on behalf of his clients.","HELD: Appeal allowed. The trial judge found that SGI was liable in negligence on the basis that it failed to properly identify the nature and extent of the Homeowners' existing insurance coverage, which was not covered by the original policy. The Homeowners were awarded recovery against SGI equal to 50% of the judgment.  1)The trial judge correctly placed the duty of care on the intermediary SGI, which the insurer agreed to undertake. SGI did not publish the availability of this special insurance coverage in any of the materials distributed to its agents. It was clear that the trial judge relied on that portion of the application form where the previous McCallum Hill policy number was stated together with the reference to the support document SF 222. The question is whether these references provided an adequate direction to the insurer about the coverage that was to be procured for the homeowners. 2)SGI is not a third party to the Contributory Negligence Act. In practice, SGI does not compare a previous policy with a new policy application to make sure that any changes in coverage are intentional. There is no such general duty on the insurer.  3)There are a number of legal bases on which insurance intermediaries may be found liable to insurers or customers and the nature of the duty that liability implies. The possible legal bases are warrant of authority, contract, tort or equity. 4)In the numerous cases listed in Brown (the trial judge was aware that the defendant and third party had discussed the coverage available for accidental breakage of their Swarovski collection, but with due and proper diligence he could have found that out by simply examining their previous policy. It is evident from comparing the defendants and SGI policy and the coverage applied for by the defendant that there are number of differences in the coverage requested. The defendant was found liable for failing to apply for the insurance coverage that he completed for the homeowners. He proceeded to assess damages."
8_2010skqb467.txt,"Employees were entitled to wage adjustments under the collective bargaining agreement. The plaintiff union brought an application for an interlocutory injunction requiring the defendant to pay employees who were retiring in 2010 their wage adjustments in the current calendar year. This was an issue because it would affect pensions and retirement dates. In the alternative, the union argued the employer should pay the entitlements before the year end on a 'best approximation' basis or be required to proceed to an expedited arbitration. The defendant brought a motion to strike or dismiss the plaintiff's motion under Queen's Bench Rules 99 and 173 on the basis that the issues raised were terms and conditions of the employment contract and outside the jurisdiction of the Court according to the terms of the collective bargaining agreement. HELD: The defendant's application was dismissed because the Court has residual discretionary jurisdiction to grant relief not available under a statutory arbitration scheme. The plaintiff's application for an injunction was also dismissed. While there may be a serious issue to be tried, the pleadings do not set forth a strong prima facie case. While there might be some irreparable harm to some employees, in general terms the losses can be dealt with through damages. It would be impossible for the defendant to meet a deadline two weeks away because of the complexity of the calculations. It is not appropriate to grant an injunction requiring the defendant to make payment before the end of 2010 and it is not reasonable to make payments based on best approximation. The Court has no jurisdiction to force arbitration on the parties.","The claim now before the court is not necessarily a nullity. Although it can otherwise appropriately be struck pursuant to Rules 99 and 173 it can nevertheless subsist if only to provide a platform of pleading to support an application for interlocutory relief. The defendants’ motions to strike are dismissed. It then becomes necessary to determine whether the plaintiffs are entitled to mandatory injunctive relief. HELD: The motion to strike is dismissed.  1)It is not appropriate for the court to grant an injunction requiring the defendants to make the required retroactive assessment payments before the end of 2010. Neither do I see any reasonable prospect of a solution to the problem by making payments on a 'best approximation' of entitlement. That is a viable solution. However, the retroactive payment does not form part of the retiree’s 2010 income. In the long run the results of such a solution are likely to be troublesome and chaotic. 2)The court was without jurisdiction to direct an expedited arbitration process in the way that was proposed by the plaintiffs. It would be inconsistent with the determination of the Supreme Court in the Weber case that the model of overlapping jurisdiction is no longer to be followed. 3)The plaintiffs had provided abundant evidence that in practical terms the imposition of a deadline less than 2 weeks from now could conceivably be met."
7_2010skqb33.txt,"The accused was convicted of common assault, break and enter and commit assault and assault causing bodily harm and his former common law spouse was the complainant in each instance. The accused also entered guilty pleas to three charges stemming from breaches of no-contact conditions with the same complainant plus two charges of obstruction of justice by attempting to dissuade the same complainant from giving evidence. The RCMP had to execute a Feeney warrant to locate the complainant in the accused basement. The Crown sought an order declaring the accused a dangerous offender. HELD: The accused was designated a dangerous offender and was sentenced to imprisonment in a penitentiary for an indeterminate period on the conviction pursuant to s. 267(b) of the Criminal Code and received time served on the remaining eight charges. The evidence is conclusive that the offence for which the accused was convicted was a serious personal injury offence. The evidence was conclusive that the accused constitutes a threat to other persons because of his pattern of repetitive behaviour and persistent aggressive behaviour. The accused's First Nation would provide support for the accused but its support system is presently non-existent. The Court rejected the expert opinions recommending a long term offender order as being appropriate.","HELD: The accused was convicted of assault causing bodily harm contrary to s. 753(a)(i) of the Criminal Code and of obstructing justice by dissuading or attempting to dissuade the complainant from testifying against him. He was sentenced to 10 years imprisonment. The court found that the accused had a pattern of repetitive behaviours showing failure to restrain his behaviour and likelihood of causing death or injury to other persons. The Crown was only required to prove that the offender had a substantial risk that he would reoffend and that there was a reasonable possibility of eventual control of the risk in the community. There were no other mitigating factors in R. v. Lemaigre, 2008 SKQB 149. 1) The court adopted the reasoning of the other appellate courts in Canada. There can be no burden of proof on the Crown to negate the third criterion, which is that the Gladue factors must be considered in determining sentence. 2) If the accused is found to be neither dangerous nor long-term offender, Part XXIV of the Code does not apply. The sentencing principles articulated by R. were based on the principles of R. and v. Kakekagamick. 3) The accused is an aboriginal offender. He broke into a house on the T[…] First Nation and assaulted the complainant. She had no memory of what happened after that or how she got to the house. There are a number of other incidents that have resulted in the complainant testifying against the accused, including the assault on the complainant and her attempts to get the accused to stop punching her and pushing her down the hallway and along the side of the complainant's house. If the Crown has failed to prove the accused's repeated behaviours, the court imposed a sentence of 10 years."
b_2000canlii4425.txt,"Plaintiff suffered soft tissue damage to knee when he tripped over a dolly cart in a building supply warehouse. Knee became swollen and infected and he was off work for 12 days. He claimed for pain and suffering, loss of income and loss of earning capacity. Plaintiff was found 60% responsible for injuries and defendant 40% responsible. Damages were assessed as follows: $8,500.00 for general damages, $5,000.00 as damages for loss of income and $1,000.00 for loss of ability to perform household tasks. The dolly cart out of view behind the counter was an 'unusual danger' which the defendant knew or ought to have known of and reasonable care was not used to prevent injury. However, the plaintiff failed to look at the floor as his attention was focused on the door. He assumed nothing had changed in the area from the time he entered the premises a few minutes previously. The plaintiff was in commercial premises and should have taken greater care to observe and avoid anything in his path. The plaintiff suffered an injury which restricted his activities for the first five months, to a lesser extent for the following year and to a very limited extent to the time of trial. There was no evidence to support a claim for diminishment of earning capacity.","The plaintiff injured his knee when he tripped over a 'dolly-cart' while attending at the premises of the defendant. He was attending to clear lumber at the defendant's premises and when he entered the premises, he did not see anything located on the side of the desk or any obstruction by the glass doors. He proceeded to the lumber yard where he parked his vehicle and then returned to the premises where he picked up lumber from the contractor's desk. At the conclusion of the trial, the court awarded the plaintiff $8,500.00 by way of general damages. The court recognized that the defendant had not used reasonable care in these circumstances to prevent injury or damage to persons in the position of the plaintiff and awarded the sum of $5,000."

Several of the defendants made application to have the plaintiff s solicitor removed as solicitor of record claiming this was a conflict of interest. Dismissing the application, that the test in such circumstances is whether the public represented by the reasonably informed person would be satisfied that no use of confidential information would occur. To do so it must be shown that a solicitor client relationship existed. There must not be a danger of the confidential information coming back to haunt the client. The court found that such a relationship did not exist in this instance. In addition, the applicant must demonstrate that the solicitor received information which is relevant to the matter at hand. The court found no such evidence of this possibility. It is no bar to representation by a solicitor that some former partners at a previous firm will be examined for discovery or called to testify.","The Court found that, in a law corporation, a person who acts for the benefit of a pension plan or a corporation acts as a fiduciary to the client, does not have a solicitor-and-client relationship. The Act requires disclosure of all confidential information which is relevant to the matter at hand. To be sure, the Act requires a factual connection between the confidential information received by the client and the firm which is sought to remove the solicitor, and the fact that the confidences are shared amongst the lawyers of the client. This disclosure does not, in the Court's view, create a sufficient conflict of interest to disqualify the applicant from representing the plaintiffs in this action."

The defendant proposed to open a pharmacy on the premises. Another tenant in the shopping centre already operated a drug store and their lease provided that no other tenant would operate a drug store in any part of their premises. The other tenant brought an application for a interim injunction against the defendant. The receiver of the shopping centre also brought an application for a declaration that the defendant could not operate a pharmacy on its premises. The defendant objected to the receiver's application on the basis that it involved controverted issues of fact requiring a trial. Application for interim injunction dismissed on the basis that the applicant had not established irreparable harm; the receiver's application could proceed as an application as the potential for a factual dispute was insubstantial; defendant provided with the option of either accepting an adjournment to allow time for further investigation, the conduct of discoveries and the presenting of any further evidence or moving for the court's further consideration.","The defendants applied by way of originating notice for a permanent injunction against the defendants. The defendants had made a twenty-five year lease for 22,000 square feet that became a supermarket.

Shoppers Drug Mart sued the defendants and applied for an interim injunction. Both applications were brought in chambers and the evidence, both the affidavits and cross-examination, were treated as going to both proceedings.

It was entered into effectively and it is to be enforced according to its terms. There is no dispute as to the terms of the lease amendments. The essential aspects of the conduct alleged to constitute breach are known and uncontraverted. The potential, and emphasize the word potential, for controversy would be evidence to be introduced of the circumstances surrounding its formation.

HELD: A sentence of 5 years of imprisonment was imposed. The sentence was set aside because it did not comply with the fundamental principle of sentencing that it be proportionate to the gravity of the offence nor achieved the objective of denunciation of crimes of this nature. The manslaughter resulted from a common criminal enterprise, planned in advance, and was expected to be violent. The accused pled guilty, had no criminal record, did not participate in the actual physical beating and stabbing of the victim who died from the wounds or of the other victim; she intervened to stop the beating although only after being satisfied the alleged the drug dealer had nothing to give the robbers.  The accused appeared to be doing well in the prison programs. The sentence of the co-accused who had a record of 40 previous convictions had been increased to the equivalent of more than 10 years imprisonment.","The 18 year old, who had pleaded guilty to a charge of manslaughter in respect of the death of Milan Kulas, was sentenced to 2½ years imprisonment. The Crown appealed the sentence, alleging that it was not proportionate to the gravity of the offence and failed to meet the requirements of the law in terms of deterrence, denunciation and separation. HELD: The appeal was allowed. The sentence was set aside and a sentence of five years imprisonment was imposed in lieu of 5 years. The following factors mandate a lesser sentence: 1) she had no criminal record; 2) she did not participate in the actual physical beating and stabbing of the victims and intervened to stop the beating of the robbers; and 3) she seemed to be doing well in all programs in prison."
5_2010nspc18.txt,"The on-site supervisor was convicted of two offences under the Fall Protection and Scaffolding Regulations (failing to ensure a guardrail was installed at the perimeter of the work area and failing to ensure that an intermediate or 'mid' guardrail was installed) after a mason was killed when he fell from scaffolding on the job site. Prior to the mason beginning work for the day and the supervisor temporarily leaving the site, he had told another employee to install a 'mid' guardrail but no such rail was in place when the mason fell. The court found that having decided to use guardrails, the defendant was required to make certain that those guardrails were, in fact, constructed in the manner prescribed in the regulations and to supervise and inspect the scaffolding before work was undertaken, no matter the experience level of his crew. In regard to the first count, what the supervisor thought might be a substitute for part of a proper guardrail system did not comply with the regulations. The defendant will donate $2,000 to the Public Education Trust Fund and make 18 presentations at various venues over the next 18 months; he will appear in court on a specified date to provide a status report on his progress in this regard. This was not a case of reckless disregard or deliberate indifference to the legislated safety measures and the defendant's degree of moral blameworthiness was at the lower end of the continuum as he neither created nor negligently left in place a hidden hazard. Both the actions of another workman and the deceased's own actions had contributed to the fall.","The defendant was found guilty of failing to comply with two provisions of the Fall Protection and Scaffolding Regulations of the Occupational Health and Safety Act. He was working on a work platform supported by scaffolding that was approximately 13 feet above the concrete sidewalk. As he stepped out and reached to secure his block or level line, he placed one foot on the open edge of a false ceiling suspended by wires under the roof overhang. When he placed his weight on that false ceiling, it gave way and he fell off the work platform. He suffered serious injuries and was hospitalized for a short time. The defendant was given a global fine of $1,000 to $2,000, which he was fined in the amount of $8,050. In assessing the appropriate sentence, the Court was required to take into account the defendant's own actions, which contributed to the hazard of working at heights without any fall protection measures in place. It was also required to consider the moral blameworthiness of the defendant, as he failed to take every reasonable precaution to avoid the contraventions of the Act as particularized in R. v. Giant Yellowknife Mines Limited (2009) Carswell NWT 33 (NWT Territorial Court) as authority for the proposition that contributory negligence is an appropriate factor to consider in determining a fit and proper sentence. Both the failure of the worker to do as he was directed and his errors in judgment regarding the interpretation of the legislation relating to the top-rail led to a situation where danger was created and the defendant was working in a safe and healthy workplace. He died as a result of those injuries."
b_2018skca65.txt,"HELD: The appeal was allowed and a new trial ordered. In this case, the court found that the judge had not erred in his decisions regarding the first and the third requests for adjournment but had in the second request by failing to provide sufficient reasons for his denial. Amongst many factors it considered, the court found that most importantly, the appellant had not caused his counsel to withdraw for the purpose of delaying trial. It concluded that the error resulted in a miscarriage of justice based upon the appellant’s poor conduct of his own defence and lack of understanding of trial process.","After trial, the trial judge convicted the accused of one count of fraud over $5,000, contrary to s. 380(1)(a) of the Criminal Code. The accused's counsel had justifiably withdrawn, leaving him to conduct his own defence. The issues on appeal were whether the judge's refusal to grant an adjournment was based on reasons not wellfounded in law and whether the decision affected the accused's right to make full answer and defence or his right to fair trial. HELD: The appeal was allowed and a new trial ordered. 1) There is no tenable basis for interfering with a trial judge's discretion in refusing to grant the adjournment if the fact that he is without counsel on the scheduled trial dates is not his fault but that of his counsel and he had no complicity in the matter. 2) In the circumstances of this case, the appeal and the trial, there is nothing in the record which could legally support the presumption that counsel's absence was a premeditated scheme in complicity with the accused. It was the first time the case was being called and there was nothing to justify such an inference rather than mere suspicion."
5_2005nssc172.txt,"The parents applied for leave to apply to terminate a permanent care and custody order respecting their three children. Proposed Notices of Adoption were filed for two of the children after the parents' application was filed but before it was heard. The order had been made due to, inter alia, issues of poor hygiene and nutrition; lack of supervision; domestic disputes; physical risk to the children due to inappropriate discipline; the mother's explosive temper and mental health; the father's anger; lack of insight, desire or inability to improve by the parents; inability to control themselves during access or exercise access meaningfully and an all-consuming anger and preoccupation with the Agency. Since the order was made, the mother was diagnosed with and now receiving medication for bipolar and obsessive compulsive disorders. Application for leave granted; access not ordered at the present time; supplemental affidavits and viva voce evidence were considered given that the parents had only obtained counsel after the application was filed and the nature of the issue at stake; the application could not be arrested simply because the Agency had taken steps to have the children adopted after the application was filed. Some of the factors leading to the permanent care order were being addressed by the parents, although they had not been fully dealt with; the main achievements so far appeared to be an improvement in the parents' relationship, the courses of counselling and parenting instruction they had embarked upon, an expressed willingness by the mother to undertake psychotherapy, the mother's diagnosis and medication and the parents' changed attitude towards cooperation with the Agency; these are significant building blocks on which to anchor intense parental counselling","The applicants applied for leave to terminate an order for permanent care and custody respecting their three children. The applicants had been fighting an old war, blaming the Agency for their past. They had taken parenting courses, marriage counselling and parenting counselling, and had placed the children in different adoptive homes because notices of proposed adoption had been given. Counsel for the applicants indicated that they intended to proceed with the application for leave rather than the application to terminate. They opposed the leave application on the basis that the applicants had allowed matters to escalate with the Agency and that they had supported the applicants' aggression against the agency in order to avoid an outburst with the children. HELD: The application was granted. The court found that the evidence presented by the applicants was not sufficient to justify granting leave to apply to terminate the order for the permanent care. The children were placed in one home for adoption, and their parenting was abysmal. 1)The applicants had completed 35 sessions of anger management training. 2)Although other parenting services are available through Family Services, it is unlikely that these services will benefit them sufficiently. 3)The father had completed a 35 session Anger Management Course. He was originally sceptical about the program, but now believes that it is possible. 4)Although the Agency has made some positive changes, they have not demonstrated that they can provide the stability, consistency and appropriate parenting required by the court. The parents have not made significant changes in the lives of the children, and there is a great deal of uncertainty about their ability to parent. The Agency is concerned about disturbing the children and is prepared to cooperate with them in any way possible to have them returned or even 'to have access to them'."

The defendant did not file affidavit evidence but opposed the application solely on the basis that recent amendments to the Queen's Bench Act precludes reference to minutes of settlement. HELD: The plaintiff was entitled to enter judgment for $15,000 plus costs of this application. A settlement agreement reduced to writing in no way offends the confidentiality required under s.28.1. The plaintiff is entitled to rely on the minutes of settlement and must be permitted to refer to them in his affidavit. Section 28.1 is not meant to apply to this situation. If a party to an action is unable to enforce a concluded settlement, the pre-trial process becomes meaningless. The legislation never intended such a result. There was no suggestion that there was non-disclosure, misrepresentation, duress or fraud in the execution of the minutes of settlement. Nor was it suggested the minutes were unclear or ambiguous. The defendant did not allege the settlement was amended or altered or that the balance of $15,000 does not remain owing.","The plaintiff applied for summary judgment pursuant to Queen's Bench Act rules 184A(1)(a) and s. 29 in accordance with minutes of settlement agreed to by the parties following a pre-trial conference. The defendant argued that the majority of the plaintiff's affidavit must be struck by reason of the fact that the averments contravene s. 28.1 of the Queen’s Bench Act, 1998. HELD: The application was granted. 1)The defendant was to pay $20,000 plus costs taxed to the date of the Minutes of Settlement. 2)The plaintiff did receive the first installment of $5,000 from the defendant. The remaining $15,000 was not paid to him nor had it been paid to his lawyer. 3)There was no suggestion that the settlement was amended or altered at that time. Nor did he suggest that the balance of money did not remain owing. 4)The enforceability of the settlement agreement can be determined by reading and interpreting its terms.  The defendant opposed the application solely on the basis that the plaintiff opposes the application.  5)Settlements of actions are encouraged in our courts for great many years and it appears to me that the courts should be hesitant in upsetting or rectifying minutes of a settlement unless of course there be something in the nature of fraud, incapacity of a party or the minutes are too vague to enforce or are obviously incomplete. There is no suggestion by the defendant that there was non-disclosure, misrepresentation, duress or fraud in the execution of the minutes of settling. There may, in certain circumstances, be exceptions where court will allow reference to be made to discussions, conversations and the like where such allegations are raised. do not have to decide that issue in this case.

c_2003skqb46.txt,"The Attorney General applied to strike out the plaintiff's claims on the grounds they are statute-barred by virtue of the LAA s.3 and that all the claims except for trespass to person are not exempted by s.3(3.1); by POPA s.2; alternatively, the Court has no jurisdiction over any cause of action relating to intentional torts committed by a Crown servant or employee prior to May 14, 1953; all claims arising from the conduct of two deceased Sisters who died in 1988 and 1993 are barred by the TA and SAA. The plaintiff claimed he was physically assaulted by employees and staff and suffered the loss of his traditional language and culture between 1944 and 1952 while attending the Qu'Appelle Residential School. The AG acknowledged the plaintiff attended the school from 1946 until 1949. The AG in a previous application was granted leave to amend its statement of defence and third party claim to plead and rely upon the Crown Liability and Proceedings Act; Limitations of Actions Act ss.31(d),(h) and (j); Public Officers' Protection Act; Trustee Act s.59, or its predecessor legislation Survival of Actions Act s.10; Crown Liability Act s.3(1)(a) and the Exchequer Court Act s.19. A third party claim against the Oblats alleging they controlled and operated the residential school at all material times, was not relevant on this application. HELD: 1)The claim based on physical assault by the Sisters was struck. The Court has no jurisdiction over any cause of action relating to intentional torts committed by a Crown servant or employee prior to May 14, 1953. The Crown remains immune from claims for trespass, assault and battery committed by servants and officers before the enactment of the Crown Liability Act in 1953 (renamed the Crown Liability and Proceedings Act in 1990), which did not operate retroactively. The LAA s.3(3.1) does not create a cause of action but simply removes statutory time limitation periods barring otherwise existing actions. Before May 14, 1953 the Crown was subject to claims for negligence pursuant to the Exchequer Court Act s.19(c). The Dyson procedure is available in Canada in every jurisdiction except New Brunswick and Nova Scotia. 2)The claim based on negligence is subject to the two year time limitation prescribed by LAA s.3(1)(d) which must calculated having regard to the principles of discoverability. 3)The claims of breach of trust and breach of fiduciary duty are equitable claims subject to the six year time limitation in LAA ss.3(1)(h) which explicitly begins to run from the discovery of the cause of action (PG v. AG Canada). Relevant factual issues are to be dealt with at trial. 4)Even though the claim in trespass is based on acts alleged to have occurred over 50 years ago, it clearly falls within the class of actions contemplated by LAA s.3(3.1)(b)(ii). As such it is also exempted from any limitation period against others liable for the conduct. 5)The argument that the 12 month limitation period in POPA s.2(1)(a) should be applied in priority to the more general provisions of the LAAA was rejected in RJG v. AG Canada. 6)Claims based on direct liability of the Crown for negligence, breach of trust and fiduciary duty are not affected by time limitation periods applicable to the deceased Sister Greyeyes and her estate. The time limitation periods are abrogated by LAA s.3(3.2). Since there is no limitation period barring an action against the Sister or her estate, there can be no provincial limitation period available to the Federal Crown under CLPA s.24. 7)The other claims made directly against the Federal Crown are not affected by limitation periods applicable to Sister Elle or her estate. SAA ss.5 and 10(1),(3) and (4) do not bar the claims against her.  LAA s.3(3.2) abrogates the time limitation in SAA s.10(3)(b).","The Attorney General applies to strike out the plaintiff's claims on the grounds that they are barred by certain statutes, or alternatively that the Court has no jurisdiction over any cause of action relating to an alleged intentional tort committed by a Crown servant or employee prior to May 14, 1953. The plaintiff claims that he was physically assaulted and that he lost his traditional language and culture approximately 50 years ago, when he was attending the Qu'Appelle Residential School near Lebret, Saskatchewan (the 'Residential School'). The Attorney General acknowledges that Sister Elle was employed at the Residential School from 1944 until her death in 1993. HELD: 1) The limitation period in the POPA is set aside by s. 3(3.2) of the LAA for actions which fall within the scope of s3(3).1 Of the various types of torts, the only one exempt from limitation period is the one described in [R.J.G.] v. Canada (Attorney General), [2001] 1 S. 3.1, as amended. 2) The plaintiffs purport to bring this action against the Crown pursuant to the Crown Liability and Proceedings Act and against the other defendants as Crown agents, but only if the negligence occurred on public work. The purpose of this legislation is to protect actions of public authority 'of an internal or operational character' or that are 'distinct, separate, subordinate and incidental' to the execution of the public mandate. As such, the 12 month time limitation period under s.3(1)(d)(i) does not apply. 3) There is no agreement on the facts (as required by Rule 188 of The Queen's Bench Rules) as to the jurisdiction of this Court to determine whether the plaintiff can satisfy the requirements of discoverability. It may well be impossible from practical standpoint for the plaintiff to establish, by balance of probabilities, that he did not discover, or should not with reasonable diligence have discovered, the wrongful nature of the Federal Crown's acts and the nexus between those acts and his injuries. The claim of negligence is not subject to the two year time limitation in s3 as it is not relevant to this application by the Attorney General. 4) The plaintiff's claim of breach of trust or breach of fiduciary duty are not exempted from limitation periods under s3 because the claim is based on events occurring prior to the date the claim was made. 5) The six year limitation period for actions based on vicarious liability for assault remains unchanged.  6) The 12 month"
c_1996canlii6986.txt,"A Director was charged with professional misconduct for coercing the resignation of two principals in his school division. The Discipline Committee found the appellant guilty of misrepresenting the school process report involving the first principal and of threatening the other principal that if he did not apply for a transfer and resign the matter would be dealt with at the board table and that 'it could get ugly'. The Executive Committee of LEADS issued a reprimand to be placed on his file for five years and a fine of $2,500. At issue was whether the Discipline Committee erred in its findings of fact and the burden of proof, whether the facts, if true, constituted professional misconduct and whether the penalty imposed was excessive. HELD: Appeal dismissed.  1)The legislation does not appear to call for a change in the traditional approach. The fact that an appellate judge can substitute his or her decision for that of the Discipline Committee or order of an executive does not mean that the appellate court's view of the facts and credibility of witnesses supercedes in any way the role of the Discipline Committee unless it finds there were inappropriate inferences drawn, conclusions reached which were not supported by the evidence, or a misdirection on a point of law. None were found in either case. The Discipline Committee did not err in its interpretation of 'professional misconduct' or its application to the facts.  2)Section 52 of the LEADS Act and s62 of the Medical Profession Act, 1981 are virtually the same except for minor changes in wording and format. The jurisprudence under the Medical Profession Act was applicable to the standard of review in this case. 3)The penalty imposed was not wrong or unjustified. Section 47 of the LEADS Act gives the Executive Committee wide latitude in the nature of punishment that it may impose upon a person found guilty of professional misconduct. The Executive is not bound by the recommendations of the Discipline Committee. They are only guidelines. 4)The Act is silent as to who shall bear costs of providing the documents filed pursuant to s51(2) of the Act. If the legislature had intended the statutorily mandated costs to be costs in the cause it would have said so. LEADS should bear the costs in this case. In any event pursuant to the court's inherent jurisdiction and pursuant to s52 of the Act the costs of providing the materials were to be borne by the respondent. 5)Subject to the above the respondent was entitled to costs of and incidental to the appeal.ADDENDUM to TWL QB96220. The concluding paragraph was amended to read: Subject to what has been stated in the immediately preceding paragraph hereof, the respondent will be entitled to recover its costs of, and incidental to this appeal, from the appellant, to be taxed on Column 3.","This was an appeal pursuant to s. 51 of The League of Educational Administrators, Directors and Superintendents Act from the decisions of the Discipline Committee, and the Executive Committee of the LEADS, which found the appellant guilty of professional misconduct. The Discipline Committee recommended that the appellant be transferred. The matter of sentence was dealt with by the Board of Education for a period of 5 years. The appellant received a reprimand (to be placed on his file for a further 5 years) and a fine of $2,500. Both parties submitted briefs of law in support of their positions. HELD: 1) The discipline committee's decision was against the law, the evidence and the weight of evidence. 2) It did not err in its application of the burden of proof as set forth in s. 3, 4 and 6 of the notice of appeal. Rather, it was mindful of the fact that the identified acts of the appellant were found to be directly or indirectly related to the charges. If the facts as found by the discipline committee were true, then the appellant's conduct as a principal constituted professional misconduct which constituted unprofessional conduct. 3) The penalties imposed were excessive as alleged in the ground number 7 of the Notice of Appeal."
3_1996canlii4959.txt,"The Crown appealed two sentences of two years less a day each, to be served concurrently for armed robbery. The 32 year old appellant had 32 previous convictions including two armed robberies and seven convictions relating to possession of weapons. HELD: The Crown appeal was allowed and the sentence for each offence was increased to three years imprisonment to be served concurrently. 1)The judge made an error in calculating the time on remand that should have been credited to the sentence. Only six months rather than the whole year should have been counted. 2)Given the appellant's record these offences demanded more than the three year minimum generally imposed.","This was a Crown appeal against two sentences of two years less a day each, to be served concurrently. The sentences were imposed in respect of two convictions for armed robbery. The respondent agreed that the facts of the case were accurately set out in the Crown factum. He negotiated a sale of hash oil to be supplied by the complainant, who was angry that he had been ripped off and returned to confront the respondent. At that point the respondent pulled a knife and threatened the complainant. Eventually the respondent found the money underneath the complainant's bed and took it, taking the money with him. The appellant was 32 years old and had 32 previous convictions including two armed robberies and seven other convictions relating to possession of weapons. He was on parole for his conviction of 1992 for robbery, his parole was revoked, his service ended in 1995 and he was held on Remand until the date of sentencing in September 1995. HELD: Appeal allowed. Two years less one day concurrent on each charge was a sentence of more than the three year minimum generally imposed for such offences. Taking all of the factors into account, and even allowing some discount for the fact that the robbery occurred during the course of an illegal drug transaction, the sentences for each offence should be increased to three years."
c_2012nssc46.txt,"The parties agreed on discovery dates and the order in which witnesses would be discovered. As a result of an honest error, the defendant wasn't able to attend the original dates. The plaintiff became frustrated and concerned about further delays. While the defendant was making good faith efforts to resolve the discovery issues (including whether its witnesses should be excluded from attending discovery of the plaintiff's witnesses), the plaintiff's lawyer issued discovery subpoenas to compel the defendant's witnesses to appear, making the exclusion issue moot. The defendant moved to have the subpoenas dismissed, and sought solicitor and client costs on the motion. The defendant argued the subpoenas were improper and an abuse of process, and accused the plaintiff's lawyer of making unwarranted attacks against the defendant's lawyer in his pre-hearing brief. The motion was heard over approximately one-half day. Motion granted. The plaintiff will pay total costs of $2,550 (plus disbursements) to the defendant, consisting of $1,500 in party and party costs under Tariff C and $1,050 in solicitor and client costs. The tariff amount of $1,000 is increased by $500 to reflect the fact the issuance of the subpoenas was an improper step, albeit one falling short of an abuse of process. It required the defendant to bring this motion to strike. The plaintiff was given a chance to withdraw the subpoenas and chose not to. Solicitor and client costs were warranted especially in light of the defendant's lawyer's language, which was unduly harsh and unnecessarily strong. His allegations added a layer of complexity and seriousness to the case, which caused the defendant to spend extra time preparing a response. Lawyers are officers of the court and the court must encourage them to use courtesy, respect and professionalism.","The defendant filed a motion to dismiss discovery subpoenas issued to its witnesses. The motion was allowed and the order granted included a direction as to the manner of discovery. The defendant argued the issuance was inappropriate and in non-compliance with the Civil Procedure Rules and there was a lack of certainty regarding the application of Rule 18.16 in terms of the order in which witnesses will be examined. The plaintiff sought an award of costs on a solicitor/client basis against the defendant. The Defendant argued the same things in its motion that the parties should be excluded from discovery: 1) the delay between July and September for discovery examinations was not unreasonable; 2) there was not evidence presented which warranted special consideration as to credibility issues as compared to other cases or situations; and 3) the issuing of the discovery subpoena was an abuse of process. The parties positions on discovery, when they would be held and in particular in which the parties would be discovered became entrenched as a result of the defendant's unreasonable and legally unsupportable position which caused the motion; and 4) the inappropriate and offensive comments made by the plaintiff's counsel in its pre-motion brief were found to be in breach of Rule 77.07. The Court had the discretion to increase the tariff depending upon the circumstances of the case and to increase it by $500 to $1,500 in a limited amount."
4_2016skqb136.txt,"Family Law – Custody and Access – InterimThe petitioner and the respondent had four children during the course of their marriage. They separated in 2010 and the petitioner applied for interim orders, including arrangements for the parenting of the children. The court made an interim order that the parties would have joint custody with the primary residence of the children to be with the petitioner. The respondent would have access at reasonable times and on every other weekend. The parties reconciled for two years but then separated again. In 2012 the petitioner applied for an order enforcing the 2010 interim custody order. At that application, the court found that both parents were capable of parenting, but in the short term it confirmed terms of the 2010 order. A number of pre-trial conferences were held without resolving matters, and during that time, the parenting arrangements changed substantially. The oldest child began residing with the respondent in December 2014. In December 2015, the second oldest child began residing with the respondent. They stayed with the petitioner on alternate weekends. The applicant then brought this application for an order pursuant to ss. 23(1)(a) and (e) of The Children’s Law Act and pursuant to the 2012 court order, confirming the original interim order that the four children of the marriage have their interim primary residence with her and that the respondent have specified parenting time on one day each week and alternating weekends. The petitioner alleged that the respondent was attempting to influence the two youngest children to reside with him. HELD: The court ordered that the status quo parenting arrangement should remain in place until trial. In this case, the status quo was not the arrangements as they had been in 2010 and in 2012. The court found that the arrangements had evolved since the 2010 order by agreement of the parties and the changes had not occurred because the respondent was attempting to alienate the children from the petitioner.","Three days after the parties separated, the petitioner filed an application for interim orders dealing with, but not limited to, the parenting of the children and the division of family property. The application lacked a claim under the Divorce Act, RSC 1985, (2d Supp), and has never been amended to include such a claim. The parties have primarily resided with the respondent for the past three and one-half years. The petitioner seeks orders pursuant to s. 23(1)(a) and (e) of The Children's Law Act and/or the Children's Property Act to eliminate the parenting arrangements that have evolved for the children in such a way that would change their primary residency of T. and K. and severely restrict the respondent's parenting time with all four children. HELD: 1) The application was cast as a request for a restraining order under the Children’s Law Act or an order of Kraus J. of November 22, 20112. In reality, the application was an application to replace a previous interim order made by the respondent with an order requiring the children to continue to have their primary residence with the petitioner. 2) There was no evidence that the children would be at any risk in the meantime. 3) An adjournment at this point would simply add to the time and cost of dealing with the problem to no particular end. It would be inconsistent with the purpose and intention of Rule 1-3. 4) The petitioner was granted interim parenting time on Wednesdays, Fridays and alternating weekends. 5) The respondent was prohibited from entering the said home until further order. The purpose and intent of the petitioner is to obtain an order eliminating the parenting arrangement that has evolved for them in a manner that would fundamentally change the children's education, including without limiting the generality of the foregoing when they are entitled to go on the school bus. 6) Certificates of completion at the parenting program were filed by both the petitioner and the respondent on September 29, 2010. 7) Pursuant to that order, the interim parenting order of September 28, 2010 (as modified by the parents in their Memorandum of Understanding) shall remain in effect. 8) The Court will respond to the purpose, intent and substance of this application for what it is. 9) It is apparent from the petitioner's own evidence that this has not been the reality for the last 3 and 1/2 years with respect to equal parenting time during major holidays, since the separation and other court orders.

The accused appealed. Dismissing the appeal, that the arrest was not random and was not made in good faith and was a deliberate breach of the accused's rights under s. 9 of the Charter.

He thought the vehicle was running when he woke up but the learned judge, even though he appreciated the candid evidence he gave, clearly understood that the accused's memory of the events was far from clear given the level of his intoxication and that he had not then occupied the seat for the purpose of setting the vehicle in motion. He was perfectly entitled to reject the theory. 2)The Court was able to conclude that the appellant was caught by the presumption of care and control of his vehicle (Criminal Code s. 258(1)) which held that where it is proven an accused occupies the seat normally occupied by the operator of the vehicle, it is presumed he is in care and Control unless he can establish that he did not occupy the seat as a de facto control. It was perfectly within the remit of the trial judge to accept and rely on the evidence presented by the ambulance and police officers and to jointly develop the conviction and conviction of the accused."
c_2009skca53.txt,"The three respondents pled guilty to three offences: trafficking in cocaine for the benefit of, or at the direction of, or in association with a criminal organization contrary to s. 467.12 of the Criminal Code; conspiring together and with others to traffic in cocaine contrary to s. 5(1) of the Controlled Drugs and Substances Act and s. 465(1)(c) of the Criminal Code; and trafficking in cocaine contrary to s. 5(1) of the Controlled Drugs and Substances Act. On the last two counts, each was sentenced to 1 year less a day to be served in the community on each count, to be served concurrently, plus a 10 year fire arms prohibition. On the first count, each was sentenced to serve 1 year, in the community, consecutive to the sentences for the other counts. They were also subjected to DNA orders and there was an order of forfeiture of a vehicle belonging to a third party. The Crown appealed these sentences on the grounds that the sentencing judge failed to give proper effect to the gravity of these offences. The Court weighed all the evidence and circumstances of the accused, and found the sentencing judge was clearly moved by the personal circumstances of the accused and while they are mitigating and would normally justify a sentence at the low end of the range, it was the Court's view that the sentencing judge gave them undue weight in comparison to the principles of denunciation and general deterrence, which must play a significant role in offences of this nature. The Court further stated the 1 year sentence for the trafficking offence, to be served in the community, was demonstrably unfit given the range of sentences established in other cases of trafficking offences, even after taking into account the mitigating personal circumstances of these offenders. The Court found the sentences must be set aside. The Court found that an appropriate sentence for each of the respondents, taking into account the seriousness of the offences, the personal circumstances of the respondents, and the aggravating nature of the offences pursuant to s. 467.12, would be 18 months, concurrent, for each of the last two counts, and 1 year consecutive for the criminal organization offence, for a total of 30 months imprisonment. HELD: The total sentence in each case is 30 months, 5 months having already been served.","The three respondents pled guilty to three offences: trafficking in cocaine for the benefit of, at the direction of, or in association with a criminal organization, to be served concurrently, plus a 10 year fire arms prohibition; and conspiring together and with others to traffick in cocaine contrary to s. 5(1) of the Controlled Drugs and Substances Act and s. 465(1)(c) for its offences for criminal organization. The Crown appealed these sentences on the grounds the sentencing judge failed to give proper effect to the gravity of the offences, particularly in light of the volume of trafficking and lengthy period of time over which it had taken place, the highly dangerous nature of the substances sold, which included crack cocaine, the fact that they were working for acriminal organization and their motivation was financial gain. HELD: The sentences imposed were 30 months, 5 months having already been served. 1) The respondents all worked 12 hours a day and rotated their shifts so that the “deal” phone and delivery car were being operated 24 hours per day, seven days per week. The noted high volume of sales was made possible by practices defined by the organization and established to ensure they worked as an efficient team to ensure delivery of cocaine on a 24 hour day basis while reducing the risk of discovery. The personal circumstances and conduct of each of the respondents, particularly during the in excess of 2 year period between their arrest and sentencing for the other counts, was impressive and significantly mitigating.  2) Considerations of parity alone would have warranted a sentence of years on the trafficking charge alone in the circumstances of this case. The sentence of one year was demonstrably unfit, even after taking into account the mitigating factors of the offenders."
d_1995canlii5746.txt,"When Davidson, Sr. sold his farm to his son he retained the right to continue receiving the rentals arising from four surface leases which he had previously granted to oil companies in respect to producing oil wells. The son granted an option to purchase to the plaintiff which was exercised and a fee simple title was issued in 1973 subject to encumbrances including caveats protecting the surface leases. There was no reference to the rent charge reserved or excluded by the option agreement. The plaintiff asserted that whatever rights arose from the option agreement were merged in the transfer and effectively disappeared upon the registration of the transfer and the issuance of a new unencumbered title. HELD: Declaration denied. Plaintiff's action dismissed with costs. 1)The absence of a caveat protecting the rent charge has had no affect because of the plaintiff's continued ownership of the property.  2)Rarely, if ever, has there been a case where, as here, a purchaser has contracted to obtain the property under an instrument clearly accepting the unregistered equitable interest, then has obtained a fee simple title, then has permitted the unregistered interest to continue unimpeded for 15 years and then, perhaps tiring of the inconvenience of the lease and thinking that the money would be useful, has decided to seek an order of this Court terminating the other interest and directing that it be paid to him. His counsel made no suggestion that the plaintiff had a moral claim, it was purely an attempt to secure by legal means that which he had previously agreed to forego. This is a court of equity as well as a court of law and as such it is repugnant that the court be called upon to vest in an applicant an interest which he has heretofore freely recognized to be the property of another, both before and after receiving his transfer under The Land Titles Act. 3)It was apparent that there was no intention that the rent charge would be merged since it was recognized and allowed to continue for 15 years.","The plaintiff was granted an option to purchase land from the defendants. The option was exercised and a fee simple title was issued to him. The title was encumbered by, inter alia, caveats protecting the surface leases but there was no reference to the rent charge reserved or excluded by the option agreement. The land fell into the family of which the plaintiff was son, one who needed to expand his farming operation. HELD: The action was dismissed with costs. 1)It is repugnant that the court be called upon tovest in an interest which has heretofore been freely recognized to be the property of another, both before and after receiving his transfer under The Land Titles Act. 2)The plaintiff has been at a risk of being sued by the defendants because of the indefeasibility provisions of the land takings Act when they come into conflict with equitable rights. When the plaintiff's option to buy land was exercised he was denied the right to continue receiving rentals. 3)Whatever rights arose fromthe option agreement were merged in the transfer and the issuance of a new, and for this purpose, unencumbered title was denied to the plaintiff. 4)In this case the plaintiff had been denied his right to sue because he had not received an equitable right under the terms of the Option agreement. He therefore had no option to sue."
d_1995canlii3966.txt,The accused pleaded guilty to a charge of assaulting his 8 year old stepdaughter by slapping her and striking her with a small paddle. The Crown and counsel for the accused agreed that a fine and probation would be appropriate. The trial judge sentenced him to 1 year in prison and 1 year's probation. He appealed his sentence. HELD: Appeal allowed. 1)The force applied was minimal and the child was not injured physically. 2)The sentence imposed would result in the accused losing his employment which would harm his dependents. 3)The Court reduced his sentence to 60 days intermittent.,The appellant pleaded guilty to the charge of assaulting an eight year stepdaughter. He was sentenced to one year imprisonment and one year's probation. The Crown and the defence agreed that it was probably an instance where a fine and probation order would create the necessary special deterrence and parental guidance the situation called for. The trial judge was however of the view that the conduct of the accused warranted a more severe penalty. HELD: The appeal was allowed and a sentence of 60 days intermittent incarceration was substituted for the sentence of 1 year. The probation order was to remain unchanged except to substitute the word 'approved' for'supervised' in the first condition.
6_1997canlii9876.txt,"The respondent was hired as an account manager by the appellant. She did not reach her planned sales goals during her employment, and became depressed. She took six weeks off work on the advice of her doctor. When she returned from sick leave she was dismissed by the appellant, who had already decided to terminate her employment after concluding that she was not able to handle the job. She claimed damages for mental distress for the sudden and callous manner in which she had been dismissed. The jury awarded the respondent $20,000 in lieu of notice and $60,000 damages for mental distress. The appellant appealed the award for mental distress. Per Hallett, J.A., Roscoe, J.A., concurring, allowing the appeal, that the suddenness and callousness of a dismissal does not constitute conduct that gives rise to an actionable wrong separate and apart from the cause of action for the dismissal without notice. Per Freeman, J.A., dissenting, dismissing the appeal, that a degree of mental distress is always likely to accompany the termination of employment. However, when the employer's conduct aggravates the mental distress beyond the degree which can be remedied by agreement or reasonable notice, a right to further damages arises.","The appellant sold computer systems including hardware and software to hospitals and other health care facilities. The respondent was hired as account manager with a sales territory consisting of four Atlantic provinces. She was expected to take three or four years to develop the territory. Her responsibilities included not only making sales contacts but co-ordinating the activities of the specialists within the company who had to design and build the system required by the customer. The sales compensation plan provided for a four percent commission on software licenses and the net margin on hardware sales plus a scheme of cash bonuses for exceeding revenue targets which were not stated in her employment contract. HELD: The appeal was allowed. 1)The jury found that the respondent was entitled to six months' notice. 2)It found that mental suffering would not have been in the reasonable contemplation of the parties at the time the contract was entered into as flowing from the appellant's unjust dismissal. 3)The trial judge correctly identified two grounds for awarding damages for mental distress: 1)He should not have permitted the issue of mental distress to go to the jury and he mischarged the jury on the question of foreseeability. The jury had sufficient authority to justify the statement that damages will be awarded for mental suffering caused by the wanton or reckless breach of a contract to render performance of such character that the promisor had reason to know when the breach would be made and not to deprive them of their right to protest.  2)The court rejected the idea that aggravated damages could never be awarded in wrongful dismissal cases, particularly where the acts complained of were non-negotiable, although the majority view that tortious conduct could result in aggravated damages was not unknown."
e_1999skqb268.txt,"The defendant manufactured solarium in Saskatoon which it sold to the plaintiffs in Minnesota. The plaintiffs alleged the solarium was defective, sued and obtained judgment in the Minnesota Court which it now sought to enforce in Saskatchewan. The defendant argued the Minnesota court did not have jurisdiction because at the time the action was commenced he was not 'ordinarily resident' in the state of Minnesota. The defendant was served in Saskatoon with notice of the claim but did not appear or defend the action or surrender to its jurisdiction. HELD: The action was dismissed with costs to be taxed. 1)The defences available to defendant in Saskatchewan where an action is brought to enforce foreign judgment are set out in s.6 of the Foreign Judgments Act. 2)While there may be evidence supporting the conclusion that the defendant was carrying on business in Minnesota, that same evidence does not support the conclusion the defendant was ordinarily resident there. The defendant advertised its business in Minnesota and elsewhere in the United States and employed agents there to sell its product. The logical conclusion was that the address in the city of Minneapolis was a business address. It could be argued that the defendant carried on business in the state of Minnesota but the question was whether the defendant was ordinarily resident in that state. The Foreign Judgments Act reflects real difference in the meaning of 'ordinarily resident' and 'carrying on business'.","The plaintiffs sought to enforce payment by the defendant of judgment for $23,396.03 in US currency awarded to them by Carver County District Court in the First Judicial District of Minnesota. The action was defended on the basis that the defendant was not ordinarily resident in the state of Minnesota and did not appear before the Minnesota court or submit to its jurisdiction. HELD: The plaintiff's action was dismissed with costs to be taxed. 1)The Court in Minnesota did not have jurisdiction over the defendant because the defendant made use of United States postal facilities and had to comply with postal regulations which required an address in the United States. In order to comply the defendant arranged for an address at 701-4th Avenue South in the City of Minneapolis. An address of this nature could be understood as connoting either residential or business address. But because of the activities of the defendant in Minnesota, that is to say, its activities in sales, the logical conclusion that it is a business address, the Court in Saskatchewan did not submit to the jurisdiction of the Minnesota Court. 2)The case law have reviewed convinces me there is a real difference in the meaning of these terms and that the Act reflects that difference. While there may be evidence supporting the conclusion that the Defendant was carrying on business in Minnesota the same evidence does not support the conclusion it was ordinarily resident there.  3)Because the defendant manufactured solarium in Saskatoon, Saskatchewan which it sold to the plaintiffs in Minnesota it was brought to enforce in Saskatchewan. The plaintiffs alleged that the solarium was defective and sued the defendant and obtained the judgment in the Saskatchewan court which it now seeks to enforce.  4)Saskatchewan has a Foreign Judgments Act s.3(a) which covers the use of the term 'ordinarily resident' when an action is commenced in person or in a foreign country."
4_2000canlii3136.txt,"In a trial of liability only, jury found defendants to be entirely responsible for causing motor vehicle accident. Plaintiff was found contributorily negligent and liability was apportioned 57.5% to defendant and 42.5% to plaintiff. Plaintiff suffered significant injuries and plaintiff and spouse applied for interim payment of damages. Application allowed in part; plaintiff awarded $250,000.00 as interim payment; spouse's application denied. Once court is satisfied plaintiff has met threshold requirement of a judgment or admission of liability, it must strive with evidence before it to determine what damages are likely to be recovered by plaintiff and may then order interim payment if it thinks just, within limitation that it not exceed a reasonable proportion of the projected amount. The greater the certainty of the final outcome of liability and the greater the strength of the evidence supporting the damages claim, the higher the proportion of damages that will be advanced. There is nothing which precludes interim payment from being substantial amount in a proper case but court must be cautious to avoid any influence on eventual outcome of damage assessment. Although there had not yet been discovery of plaintiff's doctors or an independent medical exam obtained, the plaintiff's injuries were largely demonstrated by clinically objective medical evidence and there was no evidence of any pre-existing condition. In such circumstances, a substantial sum could be ordered. Neither pre-judgment interest nor costs are to be considered by the court in such an application. The evidence in support of the spouse's application was far too incomplete and had yet to be tested by defendants in discovery. Court could not form opinion on what damages spouse was likely to recover.","The plaintiff was seriously injured in a motor vehicle accident and brought an action for the recovery of damages from his employer. The issues of liability and damages were severed when a civil jury trial was held in 2000. The plaintiff sought to recover from the defendants 57½% of the damages to be assessed, an amount which was not yet been determined by the defendants in further pre-hearing procedures. The defendants offered the services of rehabilitation specialist to the plaintiff in the amount of $168,000. This was predicated on the plaintiff's counsel's projection that his damages would likely be assessed in the final analysis at something in excess of one million dollars (less 42½% for contributory negligence). The plaintiff's actuarial report quantifies the past loss of income at approximately $216,000 using a valuation date of June 1, 2000. This head of damage has a much higher degree of certainty of recovery, subject to any arguments of mitigation which the defendants might develop. The evidence to support the validity of this claim was far from complete at this stage and the defendants had offered the rehabilitation specialist a substantial interim payment. The plaintiffs filed extensive affidavits attaching several exhibits including medical reports and an actuarial Report calculating their past and future losses. HELD: An application for an interim payment under Civil Procedure Rule 33.01(A) is not substitute for an assessment of damages nor is it a mini-trial of any sort. Rather, the court has the discretionary power to order an interim payments to plaintiff, based on its opinion of the proportion of damages the plaintiff is likely to eventually recover, subject only to the reasonable proportion limitation.  1) The defendants have not yet received an independent medical examination or any of the relevant expert reports as they see fit. 2) The defendant has not yet taken the opportunity to discover any of Mr. Fowler's physicians or to conduct independent medical examinations or to retain other experts as required by the court. There is no pre-judgment interest nor costs of the action. 3) The court reviewed the state of the evidence before it and concluded that $250,000 represents a just amount of interim payment that ought to be made to the plaintiffs."
2003skqb248.txt,"An appeal from conviction and sentence for theft of an electricity generator valued at under $5,000 contrary to Criminal Code s.334(b). On the first appearance in October, 2001, the Crown advised it would proceed by summary conviction. The appellant pled not guilty. Defence argued that, in the absence of evidence to the contrary, it should be inferred that the accused acquiesced or implicitly consented to proceeding by way of summary conviction. Counsel agreed pursuant to s.786(2) to proceed by way of summary conviction and invited the court to treat the agreement as having been in place when the trial began. Both preferred the appeal to be heard in this Court or in the Court of Appeal. The appellant sought to have the conviction set aside on the grounds the verdict was unreasonable and not supported by the evidence; the trial judge failed to properly apply the doctrine of recent possession and did not provide adequate reasons for his decision. HELD: The conviction appeal was dismissed.  1)This Court had jurisdiction to entertain the appeal. The Provincial Court judge had jurisdiction as the trial proceedings did not violate s.786(2). 2)The trial judge did not misconstrue nor misapplied the doctrine of recent possession. The unexplained recent possession of stolen goods standing alone will permit, but not necessarily require, an inference that the possessor was the person who stole the goods. The elements of recent possession must be strictly proven if possession is the only evidence connecting the accused with the theft. Otherwise possession should be considered circumstantial evidence and weighed accordingly. There was no palpable and manifest or overriding error made by the trial judge in weighing the evidence.  3)Criminal Code s.687 appears to permit this Court to set aside the 9 month suspended sentence and to grant a conditional or absolute discharge. However, there was no transcript of the sentencing proceedings except for a few lines. If the transcript is not available, this Court may be reconvened to address the applicability of s.687 and whether it would be appropriate to vacate the sentence and embark on the sentencing process afresh.","An appeal from conviction on a charge of theft where the value of what was alleged to have been stolen did not exceed $5,000 and the Crown may in accordance with s. 334 of the Criminal Code proceed on indictment or by summary conviction. The substantive distinction in the proceedings is limited to the range of sentencing upon conviction. HELD: The appeal was allowed and the sentence imposed was set aside. 1)There was nothing in the decision that convinces the Court that the trial judge in Colonsay misconstrued or misapplied the doctrine of recent possession. The only reasonable inference that can draw is that the stolen that the accused stole the generator. 2)The appellant argued on the appeal the question of the jurisdiction of the judge to proceed with the trial. The judge reviewed the facts and arguments in detail in a dissertation which occupied approximately 6 pages of the trial transcript.  3)Counsel expressly agreed at the hearing pursuant to s. 786(2), that the case at trial proceeded by way of summary conviction by agreement.  4)There is no transcript of the sentencing proceedings except for a couple of lines and without being able to examine the sentencing judge’s reasons it is impossible to determine whether the judge applied correct principles or whether the sentence is excessive or otherwise unreasonable or demonstrably unfit. Neither is there in my view any indication that the learned trial judge committed any palpable and manifest or overriding error."

They were not habitually resident in Saskatchewan and had been here only 3 months. They were not living with their mother with the implied consent or acquiescence of their father. The uncontradicted evidence that the mother never had any intention to return to the matrimonial home was accepted. The Court would have declined to exercise jurisdiction in any event pursuant to s.16 since it was more appropriate for jurisdiction to be exercised in BC. The father was directed to forthwith file an undertaking to not disturb the status quo until court authorization has been obtained.","The petitioner sought interim custody, or primary residence of the children, pursuant to s. 6 of The Children's Law Act, 1997. The respondent sought a declaration declining jurisdiction or an order of joint custody pursuant to the Act. The children had been resident in Saskatchewan for approximately 3 months, during which time they have moved on two occasions. The petitioner gave no notice to the respondent of the intended move and he returned home without any warning or note. The house was in disarray and he feared that robbery had occurred and that his wife and children were injured or abducted. HELD: 1)The children were habitually resident here. They were not living with their mother with the implied consent or acquiescence of their father. The substantial evidence concerning their best interests was available in British Columbia. 2)The mother had always resided in the matrimonial home with the intention that she would return to it and resume cohabitation with the respondent. She left quickly and secretly to prevent the respondent from taking any court proceedings in BC to stop her move. 3)The father had delayed in bringing an application for custody in BC because of his mistaken belief that the petitioner was considering reconciliation. Although he learned when he received her affidavit in support of her custody application that she never had any intention to return to the home, the evidence led to the conclusion that the father did not impliedly consent, nor acquiesce, to the children living with them in Regina."

The matter came on for a hearing before a Chambers judge for an order compelling a substantive response to the demand. The judge dismissed the application for further particulars of the general damage claim, dismissing the application. When particulars are demanded before a Defence has been filed, such are generally not ordered unless necessary to enable the defendant to plead. HELD: The appeal was dismissed with costs to the respondent of $1500 inclusive of disbursements. 1)It was the respondent's position that particulars of damages need only be pleaded where the demand is liquidated. An expectation claim which depends upon variable factors (here, factors such as the state of the economy, the price of sand, the cost of excavation) need not be particularized in the pleadings. 2)The necessity for particulars must be evaluated taking into account the nature of the action and the timing of the demand in the context of the Civil Procedure Rules as whole. There are other Rules (for example Rules 18, 19 and 20) that can be utilized to discover the underlying details of the damage claim."
d_2000nsca117.txt,"Liability was admitted for a very mild rear end collision. The trial judge found the plaintiff's evidence to be lacking in credibility and found that the collision did not contribute materially to the plaintiff's poor health. It only caused a mild aggravation of her pre-existing and major back problem. The trial judge assessed general damages at $25,000. The plaintiff's costs were reduced on the basis that she refused a formal offer to settle for slightly less than what she was awarded and refused a second offer which was increased before trial to an amount in excess of what she was awarded. The plaintiff appealed and the defendant cross-appealed. Appeal and cross-appeal dismissed. No strong and cogent reasons were advanced to warrant interference with the trial judge's findings on credibility. There was ample evidence to support the conclusion that the accident only caused a mild aggravation of the pre-existing condition and thus no basis upon which court could interfere with that conclusion or adjust upwards general damage assessment. Trial judge applied no wrong principle in exercising discretion to reduce plaintiff's costs. Award of $25,000 was not so far outside range of damages for like cases as to be considered wholly erroneous estimate of damages.","The respondent admitted liability for driving his truck into the back of the appellant's motor vehicle. The trial judge described the accident as a very mild rear end collision. The appellant cross appeals claiming that the trial judge's award of $25,000, as general damages, is excessive and should be reduced. The appeal and cross appeal both dismissed with costs to the appellant to the same amount. There was ample medical evidence to support the respondent's position that there was no other reason for his present medical problems but the accident in question. No such reasons are advanced by the appellant in this case. Appeal and cross appeals both dismissed. To sustain the appeal and to sustain the cross appeal the respondent must demonstrate that the verdict's assessment of general damages is so inordinately high that it must be a wholly erroneous estimate of damages. In our opinion, and in the circumstances of this case, that award cannot be said to be so far outside the range of damages for like cases as to be considered a totally erroneous estimate."

The former registered representative of TFPG was terminated for selling unapproved investments in breach of a Shareholder Advisor Agreement which permitted the sale of TFPG's financial products and services only. TFPG sought an interim mandatory injunction requiring the respondent to return all materials and files respecting TFPG's clients, to cease any contact with its clients, and to make no attempt to solicit any current or prospective client. HELD: The respondent was ordered to immediately cease all contact with TFPG clients whose account the respondent, or anyone associated with him, had administered with a view to soliciting or directing a client, affiliate or associate away from TFPG. The restriction would not prevent a client or prospective client from engaging in any business with the respondent nor was he prevented from advertising his services. 1)It was agreed that the respondent should return all of TFPG's files and materials with a right to make and keep a copy.  2)TFPG abandoned the relief sought respecting solicitation of any business of any nature similar to that of TFPG from any TFPG client or prospective client. 3)The agreement merely set out the terms both parties agreed to for valuable consideration. It was not unconscionable nor against public policy. The respondent had warranted that he had an opportunity to seek independent legal advice prior to signing the agreement. The applicant met the test for injunctive relief but the relief as set out in the draft order was too restrictive and denied others freedom of choice as to which party they wished to deal with. 4)A contractual right to injunctive relief is only one factor. The applicant must establish that the right to interlocutory injunction is clear; there is a serious question to be tried and a strong prima facie case; that irreparable harm will result; if there is a doubt as to whether there is an adequate remedy in damages there must be a determination, on a balance of convenience, which party is likely to suffer a greater harm.","FIAT. The plaintiff sought an interim mandatory injunction requiring the defendant to deliver all files, documents, records, plans, software or other TFPG related material respecting clients of the plaintiff. The defendant had entered into a Shareholder Advisor Agreement with the plaintiff whereby the respondent agreed he would sell and represent only the applicant's financial products and services which the applicant approved. In exchange for this the respondent received commissions from the applicant. It is alleged the respondent sold unapproved investments of competitor and as result he was terminated pursuant to the agreement. As well, the applicant claims the respondent has and continues to breach the 'non-solicitation' clause in the agreement by carrying on the same business on his own. That part of the order may issue. HELD: In order to succeed the applicant must also satisfy the Court (1) that the right to an interlocutory injunction is clear; (2) that there is a serious question to be tried and there is strong prima facie case; (3) that irreparable harm will result in the absence of the injunction; and (4) if there is doubt as to the possibility of an adequate remedy in damages, there must be a determination as to which party, on a balance of convenience, is likely to suffer greater harm from the granting or refusal of injunctive relief. In the circumstances, the parties' agreement may give to a decree of specific enforcement an effect that had not been anticipated and might be oppressive and consequently the court, which has to make and enforce the order, cannot relinquish ultimate control and responsibility for it."
b_2011nssc75.txt,"After a piece of family property was divided into two parcels, one of the brothers continued to use a driveway and maintain a garden on the other parcel. When this brother died, his son continued to use the driveway and garden, even after the second property changed hands many times. When the current owners of the second property refused to allow the continued use of their property, the son claimed that his use of the driveway was of right on the basis of expressed reservation or prescription. He argued that his uncle was incompetent when he executed a statutory declaration stating that the use of both the driveway and the garden had been with his express permission. Judgment for the defendants; there was no express reservation of the driveway in the deed to the second property and the plaintiff did not have a prescriptive right to use the driveway. Although the plaintiff and his father had used the driveway in a continuous, uninterrupted and peaceful manner for well in excess of 20 years, the statutory declaration showed that this use had been with the uncle's permission.","Roy Longard, the plaintiff, wants to continue to garden on the Keel property and use the Borden driveway. By this action he claims that he has the right to do both. HELD: 1) On the basis of the Statutory Declaration and on the totality of the evidence that the Longard brothers divided the land and each occupied their respective lots, they both knew that they were using the driveway and the garden with their consent and that the property belonged to them. It would seem that if it were a right-of-way as significant as that running proximate to their residence and accessing the defendant's property, it would have been referenced in these subsequent deeds. There was no expressed reservation shown by the plaintiff herein. The plaintiff has not shown that the reservation contained in the 1942 Eldard deed to Borden houses or the one obtained by the defendant in 1995 incorporates the driveway of the defendant. This usage is not in dispute.  2) There is considerable and convincing evidence that Eldred and Roy in combination used the driveway in a continuous, uninterrupted, open and peaceful manner for many years prior to it being blocked off by the Defendants. There is no express reservation shown."

Section 273 of The Traffic Safety Act makes the registered owner liable for the driver's misconduct when the vehicle is driven by anyone who has the owner's actual or implied consent to do so. The offence under s. 203(1) of the Traffice Safety Act is a strict liability offence and its documentary evidence proved every element of the offence. The only aspect of the Crown's case that the accused disputes is that he passed highwaymen or highway equipment when he was travelling faster than60 kilometres per hour. HELD: The accused is found not guilty. The Court found the accused not guilty on the following documents: 1) a photograph of the offending vehicle showing the date and time the photograph, which in this case was taken, which was 84 kms/hr; 2) an affidavit of the person who tested, deployed, deployed and operated the speed monitoring device; 3) an SGI Motor Vehicle Division certified search. There were four affidavits confirming service of the Summary Offence Notice, the photograph and the affidavit. Each of these documents was considered by the Court to be sufficient evidence to determine the accused's guilty plea."
d_2003nssc223.txt,"The testator had prepared his own Will on a pre-printed form and left his assets to his children, whom he then proceeded to name. One of the children predeceased the testator and an application was made for an interpretation of the Will. the gift to the deceased child did not lapse; her estate is entitled to it. The general rule that a lapsed gift falls into the residue is expressly subject to any contrary intention appearing in the will; a class gift always expresses such a contrary intention. Where the gift is to a class of close relatives (e.g. to children), if this is a class gift it does not fall under this statutory exception. In such a case, the gift falls to the surviving members of the class. This case satisfied two of the exceptions to the class rule, namely, that the number of beneficiaries was given and that the names of such were given. The gift was not a class gift but rather a separate bequest to each individual child and no contrary intention was discernible in the Will.","This was an application for the interpretation of the Last Will and Testament of the testator, and specifically to determine the entitlement of the Estate of Jane Mitchell under the Will pursuant to s. 31 of the Wills Act. The testator left all of his real and personal estate to his children and grandchildren, excepting jewellery and personal clothing. His will was prepared on a pre-printed stationer's form with handwritten portions indicating the disposition of his assets. From time to time he made attempts to make changes in his will but these were not properly executed and witnessed. Counsel have urged the Court to find that Clause 11 does describe a contrary intention and that the Court was unable to discern a 'contrary intention' in the Will."

The appellant asserts a palpable and overriding error by the learned trial judge in accepting, and finding as fact, part of the testimony of a witness but not accepting the further testimony of the witness that an amount was also owing to the appellant by the respondent. HELD: The appeal is dismissed. The trial judge was not required to accept the entirety of the witness's testimony, despite having accepted most of it, particularly in light of the contradictory evidence of the respondent denying the sum claimed by the appellant. The denial by the respondent of the appellant's claim, accepted by the trial judge, was fatal to the appellant's onus of proving a mutual understanding and absolute acknowledgement of the alleged debt between the parties.","This was an appeal, pursuant to s. 39 of The Small Claims Act, 1997. HELD: The appeal was dismissed. There was no palpable and overriding error in the judgment. The trial judge's finding was not so clearly wrong as to make the decision unreasonable. The principle of law and case authorities were not before the trial judge nor argued on this appeal. The Court of Appeal had an immense advantage in assessing evidence and arriving at findings of fact and the court of appeal must extend very substantial deference to the findings in fact of a trial judge."

The defendant's bank loans fell into default after SGI disability benefits were terminated. The Bank reported the particulars of the loan defaults to a credit reporting agency (Equifax). The defendant declined to give an assignment of any accident injury settlement he might receive from SGI and requested the bank direct Equifax to eliminate any references to his default or delinquency upon the bank loans. The bank offered to put an explanatory note on their credit report confirming the arrears were the result of the defendant's automobile accident and that he had undertaken to pay the bank from the proceeds of the accident settlement. The bank commenced this action for payment. The Compains sought general, punitive, exemplary and aggravated damages in a counterclaim for breach of the bank's duty of good faith, duty of confidentiality and breach of contract. HELD: The counterclaims were dismissed with taxed costs to the bank for both the claim and counterclaims. The bank's claim was admitted at trial. 1)Compain expressly waived any contractual rights which he had to confidentiality of his credit information by the provisions of paragraph 8 of the Personal Credit Line Agreement. The principles outlined by the English Court of appeal in Tournier enumerated four exceptions to a bank's confidentiality obligation to its customers. 2)The analogy between the insurance cases and a bank and borrowing customer was not complete or appropriate. Assuming, without deciding, that banks do have a duty of good faith and fair dealing towards their customers, the bank did not breach such duties in their dealings in this case. 3)The characterization of the accounts as collection accounts was fair, reasonable and accurate in the circumstances and were not out of the normal course of business.","The plaintiff banked with the defendant, Royal Bank of Canada, and at the time of the accident the couple's mortgage loans fell into default. The Royal Bank agreed to defer commencement of any action with respect to the defaulted Bank Loans until such time as the applicant received an accident injury settlement from SGI. In the alternative, the plaintiff Bankers' counter-claimed against the Royal Bank for general, punitive, exemplary and aggravated damages. HELD: 1)None of the counter-claimants' claims were upheld and they were dismissed in total. 2)The plaintiff Royal Bank did not breach its lending contract, its fiduciary duty or its duty of confidentiality to Ronald Compain. It was not acceptable to the defendant with the result that he refused to pay his loans. 3)There was no evidence lead to suggest that the characterization of these loans, as they appeared in the Equifax reports, were out of the normal course of business. It is fair and reasonable inference to be drawn, from all of the facts and circumstances, that persons using and relying upon the equifax statements would be familiar with the various codes and classifications used to generate the credit report. 4)The Royal Bank acted fairly and reasonably throughout with its obligations to Mr. Compain and its general banking practices including its report to Equifax as a credit reporting agency."

The sole issue to be determined was whether the accused was the person operating the vehicle at the time of the stop. The police testified that they had walked through the bar before closing time and then returned to the bar at closing time. The evidence was that the accused had been seen playing drinking games in the bar. The police observed the people they had seen in the bar get into a truck and back up. The police activated their emergency equipment and approached the vehicle. The accused was sitting in the driver's seat when the police approached the vehicle. The defence suggested that another individual had been driving the truck when it backed up but had gone inside the bar to purchase off sale before the police approached the truck. HELD: The accused was convicted of both counts and a judicial stay was entered on the impaired driving count. The Court found that the evidence of the accused was unreliable as a result of her alcohol consumption on the offence date. The evidence of the person that the defence suggested was the driver was inconsistent and caused the Court concern about its reliability. The Court found that at the time the individuals got into the truck, the accused was behind the wheel and that she was the one who backed the vehicle up and pulled it forward. The keys were in the vehicle and it was running when the police came to the driver's door. The accused's blood alcohol content at the time of driving as shown by the Certificate of Analysis was 150 milligrams of alcohol in 100 millilitres of blood.","The accused was charged with impaired driving and driving over.08. The defence had admitted all of the essential elements of each charge; the only issue was whether or not the accused was the person operating the vehicle. HELD: The defence evidence lacked reliability. The accused was found guilty of impaired operation of a motor vehicle.  1) At the time the individuals got into the truck, Ms. Neigel was behind the wheel; the defence suggested that another individual was the driver. 2) The Crown did not offer any evidence beyond a reasonable doubt as to who was driving the vehicle at the time of the incident. The Court found that the keys were in the ignition when the police arrived at the vehicle and had been in the vehicle for approximately 1:00 a.m. Both officers were adamant and unshaken in their evidence that they had the vehicle in their sight at all times and at no time did the driver's door fully open. 3) The defence did not accept that evidence nor did it leave the court a state of reasonable doubt. The officer was very evasive in cross-examination, tendency he did not exhibit in examination-in-chief. The difference between the demeanour he exhibited during his testimony and that of the accused caused the court to have considerable concern."
b_2006skqb218.txt,"The respondent applies to vary the consent joint custody order granted in October 2004. His application was prompted by the relocation of the petitioner with one of their two children, Tyson. The sole issue on this variation application is the determination of the primary residence of Tyson. HELD: 1) The petitioner wants to move Tyson 5.5 hours away from the respondent. This also requires a change in access arrangements. These are changes in circumstances that are material.  2) The petitioner has developed a strong bond with Tyson. The respondent has developed a close relationship with the parties' other child Kailey. After Kailey went to live with the respondent, neither parent did much to facilitate the access of either child. Before the petitioner and Tyson moved, although a short distance apart, neither Kailey nor Tyson saw his or her non-custodial parent and sibling on a regular basis. Even telephone access has been sporadic. Both parents have established homes that accommodate only one child. 3) The petitioner's move must be considered in light of the circumstances that existed before the petitioner's relocation. The parties had already adopted a split custody arrangement without formalizing access or adjusting child support. 4) Permitting the petitioner to relocate is in the best interests of Tyson. It is important that Tyson continue to live in the home of the parent whose constant presence he has become accustomed to. The petitioner has always been Tyson's primary caregiver. The petitioner is the psychological parent.","The sole issue on this variation application is determining the primary residence of Tyson. That entails deciding what is in his best interests. HELD: 1) The parties had issued a consent order in October 2004 providing for joint custody of the children with their primary residence being the home of Shauna. Shauna was the psychological parent and Tyson had always lived with her. 2) The petitioner had foreclosed the option of returning to live in the Kindersley district. It would not necessarily serve Tyson's best interests to order that Shauna be entitled to retain Tyson's primary residence only by returning to the Archerwill district. 3) The move must be considered in light of the circumstances that existed prior to the relocation. 4) Kailey has settled in well with the Shauna family. He will be separated from his psychological parent. The special needs of Tyson require that he have the assistance and support of someone to whom he is closely bonded. Kailey, admittedly at age 11 years, is a sibling who would be a positive consequence if Tyson were living in the same home as her. She must not be asked to assume parenting role."

He argued that the Crown did not prove that he had distributed the copyrighted material, or that the distribution was to an extent that it prejudicially affected the owners of the copyrights. Dismissing the appeal, that by placing the copyrighted computer pro-grams on his computer bulletin board in a compressed format, for ease of transmission, and allowing access by modem to the programs, the appellant was distributing the programs to the prejudice of the owner's copyright.","This was an appeal by a young offender from convictions on three counts of distributing infringing copies of computer software contrary to s. 42(1)(c) of the Copyright Act. For the purposes of the Act, 'literary work' includes tables, compilations, translations and computer programs; 'telecommunication' means any transmission of signs, signals, writing, images or sounds or intelligence of any nature by wire, radio, visual, optical or other electromagnetic system. What the appellant did was distribute the copyrighted material by placing it in a restricted area designated as Hacker's Delight available only to persons granted special status and were not where any caller would become aware of them without J.PM's permission. It was clear that when he accessed his computer by modem from his friends' homes and downloaded the programs onto their computers, he was 'distributing' the infringing copies. Furthermore, by controlling the means and manner by which the users accessed their computer boards and providing the software to assist in the downloading by modem by those users, the appellant was also distributing, that is giving out, or sharing the infringing copy. The evidence accepted by the trial judge was that the programs were'scrambled' so that they could not be copied or downloaded by the callers, the evidence was that they were 'packaged' or 'compressed' for efficient storage and 'ease of transmission'. No error was raised in reviewing the evidence."

The appellant had done everything required of it pursuant to the Act. The provisions of s. 39 did not require the appellant to follow up with the local registrar’s office to see if the transcript had been filed. In a case such as this, s. 39(9) of the Act provides the court with the ability to exercise its discretion to remedy the problem and ensure that justice is achieved where a transcript could not be filed within the six-month period.","The respondent argues the appeal must be dismissed based on s. 39(5) of the Small Claims Act. The trial was conducted before a judge rendered judgment in April 2015 and certified judgment in May 2015. The appellant then served and filed notice of appeal in June 2015. In the meantime, the respondent's solicitor sent a letter to the local Registrar's office requesting the material on the trial be forwarded to the Court of Queen's Bench and that the 'tapes' be sent to Transcript Services. Transcript Services was forwarding two copies of the transcript to the appellant for their use and forwarding to the respondent. HELD: The appeal was allowed and the transcript was filed. The setting of the appeal date was confirmed. There will be no order as to costs in the circumstances. 1) Interpreting the legislation in a manner that requires the appellant to take all required steps and allowing for court intervention when matters arise beyond the control of the parties is consistent with intention of the Act and is an interpretation allowed by the wording used in the section. 2) The Act provides wide discretion to justice, always acting judicially, to do that which is required to be done to ensure justice is achieved between the parties.  3) In situations where a flaw occurs through no fault of the appellant the court must refer both to the absence of a transcript and the failure to file within the six month provision. In that case, the court may make any other order that the judge considers appropriate. To allow an appeal to be struck without the appellant having done anything incorrectly leads to an absurd result."

Because two years had lapsed further examinations were appropriate and an order issued for the petitioner to attend a further examination. If the updated information is not necessary for trial the petitioner may request costs at that time.

7_2014skqb116.txt,"Tax Law – Contract for Services – Payment of PST The plaintiff has the onus of proving it is not liable for the payment of PST on a balance of probabilities. Parties are entitled to structure their legal relationships as they see fit. The Court must determine whether the tax is payable based on the agreements as constructed between Husky and the third parties. There was no evidence that Saskatchewan Finance and the third party contractors entered into an agreement to alter the nature of the contracts so that Husky paid PST when it would not otherwise have been obligated to pay. The evidence established that Husky determined the way in which bids were submitted and the way Husky was invoiced. In each contract, Husky required that the bid include a price for service and price for materials. In each case, it was contemplated that PST was in addition to the price bid for the materials provided. The contracts between Husky and the third parties all contain provisions and terms that provide for the sale of materials to Husky. On the basis of the contracts, there was a sale of tangible property under the PST Act. Husky was the user or consumer of the cement. The third parties were providing materials and services to assist in the construction of the oil well. Husky has failed to establish that the contracts were supply and install contracts. Husky was the ultimate user and consumer of the tangible personal property. Husky is not entitled to rely on mistake of law. Husky has failed to establish on a balance of probabilities that it is entitled to a refund of the PST it paid on well cementing contracts between itself and third parties. The claim is dismissed.","HELD: The plaintiff was awarded $419,964.69 (the PST) on well cementing contracts it had with third parties. The parties brought an application to be allowed to defend the liability of the Government of Saskatchewan to the extent of $393,289.69, which the plaintiff alleged was improperly collected and paid. The third parties sought refund of the PST they had paid to the plaintiff. The plaintiff argued that they relied on the Saskatchewan Government representations and interpretations in collecting and remitting the PST and that the Government's claim against them was barred by ss.50(4) of The Revenue and Financial Services Act and s.56 of the Pension and Health Tax Act. HELD: Even if the Government is entitled to refund of PST from the third parties, the amount to be refunded to Husky is without merit because the plaintiff was the final user and consumer of the materials provided pursuant to the contracts between the third party contractors and Husky. As the government has joined the cementing contractors as third parties in this action, the court found that the true and full intention of Husky and its contractors is not contained exclusively in the terms and conditions of the contracts. The plaintiffs were awarded interest at the rate of 1:1:1.The plaintiff was also awarded judgment against the defendant, Husky Oil. The defendants were ordered to supply and remit the PST on the materials they consumed in the performance of their contracts with Husky as opposed to the government's claim for interest on the amount owing by the plaintiffs. Costs were set-off against the plaintiff based upon the fact that Husky paid PST to third parties for the purposes of the Well Cement and Fracturing Fluid contracts. Husky argued that the claim against the government for refunding the PST was without merit and that other documents outside the contracts referred to in the plaintiff's Reply to the demand for Particulars form part of those contracts and set out the intentions of the plaintiff and the contractors in entering into them. The claim against Husky contained three defences: 1) that the claims against them were barred by s.50 of the Revenue and Finance Act and the Limitation of Actions Act; and 2) that they properly levied and collected tax from the plaintiff on the sale of the tangible personal property pursuant to s.5(10(b) of the Saskatchewan Revenue and Health Act and Regulations thereto.

3_1999canlii12358.txt,"Two female employees filed complaints with the Saskatchewan Human Rights Commission alleging sexual harassment and discrimination contrary to the Saskatchewan Human Rights Code. The unionized employer applied for judicial review in the nature of prohibition contending the provisions of the Code were superseded by the collective agreement and s.25 of the Trade Union with the result that the Board of Inquiry lacked jurisdiction to hear the complaint. The chambers judge found the Act took precedence over the Code on the basis that the Act dealt specifically with the employment relationship and granted an order prohibiting the Board of Inquiry from hearing and determining the matter. Sub-questions to be determined included: what are the statutory schemes of the Trade Union Act and the Saskatchewan Human Rights Code; what has the Supreme of Canada decided about the exclusive jurisdiction of an arbitrator to resolve disputes in the context of labour law; the essential character of the dispute and ambit of the collective agreement; whether either the Code or the Act has exclusive jurisdiction to decide the dispute and if not, which statute takes priority or is paramount. HELD: The order of the Court of Queen's Bench was set aside and the matter was remitted to the Board of Inquiry appointed under the provisions of the Code. 1)The chambers judge correctly decided that the issue in this case is confined to a determination of the correct forum in which to bring the complaint of sexual harassment. 2)Human rights are fundamental, quasi-constitutional rights which embody fundamental values and public policy. Because human rights are not private rights, but public rights which constitute fundamental public policy, parties are not able to contract out of, alter, amend, or repeal or create exceptions to human rights provisions. To do otherwise would permit the denigration of the rights and obviate the protection of the rights the statute seeks to protect. 3)The mere fact that a collective agreement includes an article or clause which complies with the Code or a provision which covenants not to discriminate on the basis of the grounds set out in the Code, does not in and of itself transform the nature of the dispute from a human rights violation to a breach of the collective agreement. The ambit of the collective agreement does not affect the finding that the essential nature of the dispute is a human rights violation particularly when the public interest component and wide powers granted under the Code to redress a violation are taken into account. It is not in its essential character a complaint arising out of the employment relationship under the collective agreement.  4)The Commission was awarded its costs on double column V in this Court and on the appropriate Court of Queen's Bench tariff. No costs were requested by the intervenor.ADDENDUM: Paragraphs number 25 and 31 are substituted as follows: [25] This position was reinforced by Weber v. Ontario Hydro and New Brunswick v. O'Leary. The policy driving such decisions is that the dispute resolution process, established by the various labour statutes, should not be duplicated or undermined by concurrent common law actions in the courts. This also conforms to the theory of deference that courts accord decisions of specialized tribunals. For a complete discussion of the issue see Parr and Prince Albert District Health Board v. Saskatchewan Federation of Labour released concurrently with this judgment. The Ambit of the Collective Agreement [31] One must not lose sight of the fact that the terms of the collective agreement itself can play an important role in the determination of whether the jurisdiction of the court has been ousted in favour of an arbitrator. The fact that parties have included an anti-discrimination clause in the collective agreement does not alter the fundamental nature of the dispute or have the effect of extending the scope of the arbitrator's jurisdiction. It may play a role in determining whether the statutory tribunal would decide to hear the complaint, but it cannot affect the determination of the essential nature of the dispute or the question of jurisdiction. The essential issue is whether this complaint is a dispute between the parties with respect to the meaning, application or alleged violation of the collective agreement. To find that it is, with the result that the dispute must be arbitrated, would permit the parties to contract out of the Code, something they cannot do.","Cadillac Fairview, a unionized employer, applied for judicial review in the nature of a prohibition contending the provisions of the Code were superseded by the collective agreement and s25(1) of the Trade Union Act. The result was that the Board of Inquiry lacked jurisdiction to hear the complaint. The appellant appealed. Appeal allowed; matter remitted to the board of inquiry established under the Act in accordance with the Act. Although human rights are more than just statutory rights, they are fundamental, quasi-constitutional rights which embody fundamental values and public policy. While there is a parallel right of public interest which arises out of an employment relationship, one does not have to be a member of a collective agreement to know that such a right exists. The essential nature of this complaint is that it is a human rights violation and not a violation of s. 25 of the trade union agreement. The fact that the parties have included a covenant to comply with the Code in their collective agreement does not alter the fundamental nature of the dispute or have the effect of extending the scope of the arbitrator's jurisdiction."
e_2005skqb51.txt,"The plaintiff seeks damages for unlawful arrest and assault, including aggravated or punitive damages arising out of events which resulted in his arrest and a charge of obstruction. During the course of his arrest, the plaintiff received cut to his scalp. He remained in custody until released at approximately 7:30 a.m. that morning. The three named defendants are members of the Saskatoon Police Service. The City of Saskatoon is their employer. HELD: The action for wrongful arrest is dismissed. The plaintiff was assaulted when his head was driven onto the hood of the vehicle. The plaintiff is awarded $2,500 in general damages and pre-judgment interest on that amount. It is not an appropriate case to award punitive damages, but the Court awarded solicitor client costs to the plaintiff in the amount of $6,000 plus taxable disbursements. 1) The Court accepted the plaintiff's evidence that he did not physically interfere with the police officers outside of the lounge. The police officers that attended at the lounge and became involved in the arrest of Mr. Sampson were in the execution of their duty. The plaintiff does not dispute that he possessed the general intent to make the comments that he did throughout the proceedings and that he did so wilfully. The issue is whether or not his actions obstructed the police officers, who were in the execution of their duty. 2) The combined actions of the plaintiff and Ms. Krupa clearly interfered with the police officers' arrest of Mr. Sampson, to the point that Constable Pura called for back-up help. Once the back-up officers arrived, one of them was required to expend time and effort restricting the movements of the plaintiff and Ms. Krupa. Once on the street, they again confronted the police officers. Their combined actions clearly affected the work of the police officers in the execution of their duty. There were reasonable and probable grounds to believe the plaintiff was obstructing the police officers in the course of their duty. 3) On the facts in this matter, the same conclusion is arrived at based solely on the plaintiff's individual actions. The plaintiff's officious interference consisted of verbal abuse, excessive criticism and undue pertinacity in his discussion and questioning and provided reasonable and probable grounds to believe he was obstructing police officers in the execution of their duty. The action for wrongful arrest is dismissed. 4) The cut to the plaintiff's head is a minor one, not requiring stitches or immediate medical attention. The plaintiff experienced headaches for several weeks. He also had stiff neck and sleep disturbance. There were no long term effects. Corrigendum received January 25, 2005 and added to fulltext.","The plaintiff sought damages for unlawful arrest and assault arising out of events which resulted in his arrest and a charge of obstruction. During the course of his arrest, the plaintiff received a cut to his scalp just inside the hairline above his left eye. The events leading up to the arrest and the activity of all participants while in the lounge were not largely in dispute and vary in minor detail only. The actions of the plaintiff outside of the lounge are in dispute. HELD: 1)Credibility. Did the plaintiff's actions amount to obstruction? 2)Was it necessary to arrest the plaintiff bearing in mind the provisions of s. 495(2) of the Criminal Code or does s. 10(3) of The Police Act apply? 3)Exemplary damages. 4)The events surrounding the arrest involved the police officers arresting and removing a patron of a local lounge for being intoxicated in public place. The plaintiff did not require transportation to hospital, but nevertheless asked him if he wished to go to the hospital and he refused."
c_2004nssc248.txt,"In a divorce proceeding, the wife claimed lump sum spousal support in the amount of $20,000 to allow her to return to her native country. She also claimed that periodic maintenance was not appropriate because of the difficulty of enforcement when she is living abroad and referenced two occasions when the husband was paying periodic support that she had to seek the assistance of Maintenance Enforcement. The husband opposed paying any more spousal support but expressed a preference for lump sum support if he was required to pay more, as it would allow him to move on with his life with his new family. Husband ordered to pay a lump sum award of $10,000 to wife; when the parties moved to Nova Scotia, the husband was able to improve his financial situation, while the wife's position deteriorated.","The parties were married in 1996 and had previously been married in Sweden in 1991. There are no children of their relationship and the only contested issue on this hearing is the respondent's claim for lump sum spousal support. The parties agree all property has been divided to their mutual satisfaction and an outstanding debt of approximately 34,000 krona is their joint responsibility. The respondent was working and living in Sweden at the time of the separation, while the petitioner was living in Nova Scotia.HELD: The respondent is to pay $10,000 per month to the respondent by lump sum. This amount is sufficient to cover her living expenses for 8 months while she re-establish herself in Sweden. The court is satisfied that in addition to the two years of support given by the respondent, she is entitled to have her and her dog flown to Sweden and maintained for some 8 months. Having decided there is need and ability to pay, albeit diminishing in view of the evidence that the major contract held by his company was not being renewed, lump sum payment is preferable to periodic payments in these circumstances. Having regard to his education and obvious intention to return to Sweden, it was sufficient to fix an amount to be contributed by the petitioner."

e_1998canlii13440.txt,"The applicants sought an order under s.11 of the Landlord and Tenant Act vesting the whole term of their sub-lease with either VIP Business Centre (VIP) or 598710 Saskatchewan Ltd (SaskLtd). Bennett, owner of an office building (the Plaza), leased space to VIP for five years ending in 1997. Issues included (i)whether there had been a valid renewal of the head lease; (ii)whether there had been valid renewals of sub-leases; (iii)assuming valid renewals, did s4 of the Statute of Frauds bar enforcement against Bennett; (iv)whether the Court had jurisdiction to hear an application for relief under s11 brought solely by notice of motion; (v)are the applicants entitled to such relief; (vi)whether Bennett was bound by the sub-leases by virtue of taking the assignment from VIP. HELD: The application was dismissed. 1)It was assumed that the evidence led by the applicants was true in order to determine issues (iii) and (iv) which dispose of the application. Issues (i), (ii) and (vi) could not be dealt with summarily because of the conflicting affidavits. 2)Notwithstanding Queen's Bench Rule 13(1), the term action in s11 includes summary application by way of notice of motion. There is no reason for landlords to have better access to this Court than the tenants concerning possession of demised premises. The words 'or otherwise' include extrajudicial actions by landlords, including re-entry. Had it been concluded that it was necessry to proceed by statement of claim, such error would have been procedural one, curable under Rule without affecting the jurisdiction of the Court. 3)The Court should exercise its discretion within the guidelines outlined in Golden Griddle. grant of relief requested by the applicant would constitute an improper exercise of such discretion. They were not the sole tenant in stand alone building of the kind in Chatham Empire Theatre. The relief sought would unfairly affect the landlord. As the applicants expressed no interest in taking over the whole head lease premises on the terms of the head lease, there was no need for a conditional order of the nature of London Bridge. 4)The only memoranda consisted of the original head lease and subleases and the unsigned fax messages. The fax messages did not meet the essential requirements for a valid lease. The actions and performance by VIP and the applicant fell short of constituting part performance for the purposes of s.4 regardless of a narrow or broad interpretation of the doctrine. In any case the Court would not have exercised its discretion by binding Bennett with leases which comprised less than 15% of the head premises in the absence of evidence that clearly demonstrated the owner's ability to rent out the balance of the head lease premises was not impaired economically or physically. The applciants could obtain other office space including that offered by Bennett. General and punitive damages would provide an adequate remedy.","The applicants sought an order under s.11 of The Landlord and Tenant Act vesting the whole term of their sub-leases with either V.I.P. Business Centre or 598710 Saskatchewan Ltd. on such conditions as the Court deems proper. The applicants had entered into a written sub-lease with VIP in 1992 which leased 8,787 square feet of office space to it for term of 5 years. By this time, the head lessee had defaulted on his rent and immediately sought to re-enter the premises. VIP and the applicants had proceeded by notice of motion in circumstances where no 'action' existed. HELD: The application was dismissed. 1)The evidence led by the applicants was not true. The Court assumed that the actions and performance of the applicants fell short of constituting part of the performance for the purposes of s.4 regardless of whether a narrow or broad interpretation of the doctrine was applied.  2)The applicants were awarded the sum of $50,000 plus costs.  3)The Court was of the view that a decision on issue nos.3 and 4 could dispose of theapplication and perhaps the issues between the parties.

5_2009nspc10.txt,"The accused was arrested for possession of drugs and a weapon, and for breaching his probation. Police testified they saw him walking down the street at 10am and noticed a strong smell of marijuana. When approached, he was smoking a cigarette in front of the provincial courthouse. He said he had smoked marijuana on the street, but did not have any other drugs on him. After they spoke, he asked to leave, saying he was late for a court appointment. The police asked him to deal with this matter first, ran a CPIC check and discovered the accused was on probation and required to keep the peace and be of good behaviour. He was not cautioned/advised of his right to counsel until he was arrested on the basis of what the Crown claimed was a reasonable belief the accused possessed drugs. Police conducted a 'pat-down' search, and found drugs (marijuana and cocaine) and a weapon. The accused argued his Charter rights were violated (s. 8, 9 and 10(b)) and asked the court to exclude the evidence obtained in the search. He also argued his admission/statement was not voluntary and should be excluded on the basis that it was given in the context of a violation of his Charter rights. Motions to exclude the statement and evidence obtained in the search denied. The accused's s. 8 and 9 rights were not breached. While his s. 10(b) rights were violated when he asked to leave and the officers asked him to deal with this first (which amounted to detention), his admission/statement was made before the detention and was voluntary. Further, no evidence was obtained as a result of the breach since the search only took place after the arrest/cautioning. After reviewing the relevant jurisprudence, the court concluded: the Crown must prove the arresting officer subjectively believed they found an offence apparently being committed; that subjective belief must be objectively reasonable; police may rely on an inference in forming their belief (such as the inference that marijuana smokers typically carry a supply with them); and that inference must be objectively reasonable in light of the circumstances and facts of the case. Here, the officer's subjective belief that the accused was in possession of drugs was objectively reasonable. The court accepted her evidence that she had special training in identifying the smell of marijuana and distinguishing between a strong and faint smell of marijuana. The CPIC check showed he was on probation in relation to a drug charge. Since the officer had the authority to arrest under s. 495(1)(b) of the Criminal Code, the arrest was lawful. The search taking place incidental to the arrest was reasonable. In obiter, the court went on to say that, even if the accused's s. 8 and 9 Charter rights had been breached, an analysis under s. 24 would lead to a decision not to exclude the evidence: it was not conscriptive; the offence was serious; there was no bad faith on the part of police; and the accused could have lawfully been arrested for admitting to what was a breach of his probation.","The accused was charged with possession of cannabis marijuana and possession of cocaine for the purpose of trafficking. The accused admitted smoking the marijuana in front of a public mall before returning to the courthouse. The officers noted a strong smell of marijuana coming from the accused's person. They approached the accused and found him smoking a cigarette. The officer smelled marijuana on the accused. He was not under arrest and had not been given any order or direction not to leave. The statement of the accused to the police was found to be free and voluntary. There was no section 10(b) violation prior to the officer's access to the accused’s rights. The Court of Appeal concluded that the officer had reasonable and probable grounds to arrest the accused based upon her observations of the smell of burned marijuana. The decision was upheld on appeal. There were three witnesses who gave evidence on the voir dire: the accused was cooperative, the officer did not physically restrain him, the CPIC check indicated that the accused had just consumed a marijuana cigarette and the officer smelled strong, fresh marijuana. Although there was no police caution prior to arrest, the accused indicated that he was concerned that the police were about to arrive at the scene to arrest him; the officer was not seeking to detain the accused for any length of time; and the accused did not appear to be under the influence of marijuana."
9_1994canlii4283.txt,"The respondent had undertaken the residential development of certain lands bordering the appellant's property and constructed roadways which it proposed to convey to the Department of Transportation, who agreed to accept with the consent of owners of property where water would drain from the road. When the appellant refused to consent, the respondent applied to the municipality for proceedings under the Ditches and Water Courses Act, which failed to achieve agreement. The respondent then filed a requisition with the county clerk pursuant to s. 7(1) of the Act which allows for the appointment of a municipal engineer. The engineer filed a report in which he concluded the respondent was entitled to open a ditch on the appellant's land, subject to certain conditions. In this action, the appellant appealed pursuant to s. 12 of the Act. Allowing the appeal, that the Act appears to assume that landowners will agree that a ditch benefits their land and provides a mechanism for apportioning cost. However, it does not give an engineer authority to expropriate land or take any interest in it, nor does it provide a means by which the appellant is forced to accept the ditch. Further, the common law prohibits the use of another's property to solve one's drainage problems.","The applicant developer, Armoyan, made an application to the municipality of Halifax for implementation of proceedings under the Ditches and Water Courses Act. The applicant failed to agree to the terms of the agreement, and instead filed a requisition with the clerk of the county under s.7(1) of the Act. HELD: The applicant was awarded costs of the application.  1)The applicant was entitled to construct a ditch or drain across the Haverstock estate.  2)The Act provided a method of apportioning the cost of the ditch and drain amongst the owners and prescribing the means by which will be determined the necessary technical details of the drainage including its location and proper outlet. 3)Full compliance with the provisions of the Expropriation Act was required. 4)No costs were awarded to the applicant.  5)The Court found that the Act does not give the engineer authority to take over or any interest in the land. Rather, it appears to be a statutory authority which states that 'any person empowered by statute to expropriate land or cause injurious affection is caused by statutory authority'."
b_2001skca85.txt,"The Court of Appeal was required to determine the limits of its authority to change the application of the Rule against Perpetuities, an established common law principle, to a particular type of oil and gas lease. In 1950 Taylor entered a 'top' (head) lease for mineral rights with Freeholders Oil, effective upon the expiry of Imperial's interest in 1959. The new owner of the land recognized the assignment of the 1961 top lease sold to Tarragon in 1993. After reaching an agreement in 1993 in principle for a 'farmout' arrangement whereby Maxx agreed to drill the lands for Tarragon, Maxx concluded the top lease offended the Rule against Perpetuities and entered its own lease with the landowner. The trial judge held the 1950 Freeholders lease was void because it contravened the Rule against Perpetuities; although top leases do not offend the policy behind the rule, any modification of the rule is best left to the legislature; there was a breach of confidence. HELD: The appeal was allowed with costs on double column V. The action for a declaration that the top lease is void was dismissed with costs in Queen's Bench. 1)The top lease in question was not void as it did not offend the object and purpose of the Rule. The reasoning and approach of the Supreme Court of Canada in Salituro, Tolofson and Morguard was persuasive. The decision of the House of Lords in Arthur J S Hall demonstrates the need to re-examine archaic rules of common law which cannot be justified in modern society. The genius of the common law lies in its adaptiveness to changing times. Its basic principles are not meant to become rigid formulae. Common law rules may be tweaked to do justice between the parties when a rigid and mechanistic application of the rule would run counter to the object and purpose of the rule. Since the socio-economic and political conditions which gave rise to the creation of the Rule no longer exist, it was open to the Court to consider the application of the rule in the context of a commercial instrument such as the top lease in question.  2)Although top leases have been attacked on other grounds, this was the first case before the Saskatchewan Courts in which the Rule against Perpetuities has been advanced to void such a lease. The historical background and object and purpose of the rule were reviewed. The general purpose is to prevent the tying up of property to the detriment of society in general. The common law rule against perpetuities prevails over intention because it is not a rule of construction, but a rule of property. A mere possibility, or even a probability that the estate or interest may vest within the time is not enough. The 'wait and see' doctrine has been adopted by statute in some jurisdictions.DISSENT: The Court should not modify the Rule in the face of the significance of such a modification, the efforts of the legislature to legislate and the inability to deal with such issues as the retrospective operation of such a decision. The Rule against Perpetuities applies to this top lease. As there is no life in being in this case, the interest must vest within 21 years of its creation which would have been 1971. The Rule is not concerned with the duration of an interest but only that an interest may vest at a remote time in the future. The rule invalidates interests in land that vest too remotely.","The trial judge held that the lease was void because it breached the rule against perpetuities and allowed the respondents' action for declaration to that effect. He allowed the counterclaim by the appellant Tarragon against the respondent Maxx Petroleum for breach of confidence with consequent directions for an accounting and assessment of damages. The principal question on this appeal is whether the appellants' oil and gas 'top lease' with the late Harry Herbert Taylor should be rendered void by the rule. HELD: The appeal is allowed and the decision of the trial judge is set aside.  1) The lease was not in breach of s. 17 of the common law rule. The principles of the Freeholders agreement and the principles of habendum were not offended. 2) It is only after the time of vesting has been ascertained, that a determination can be made about whether that time is too remote and therefore in contravention of the rule, which is not open to the legislature. The policy behind the rule is not offended.""  3) The trial judge was convinced that the phrase 'in the event' as used in the opening phrase of the impugned clause speaks to contingency and to the future. To ascribe to those words a definition equivalent to way of describing reversionary interest is to distort the words beyond recognition. 4) In this case, the plaintiffs were awarded three Hundred and Twenty (320) shares with nominal or par value of One Dollar ($1.00) per share in the capital stock of the respondent, together with all the rights and remedies which are given or reserved to the grantee under the terms of the said drilling lease, and they stand in the position of the grantor. 5) The plaintiff was very interested in developing or participating in the development of the mines and minerals within the Taylor land. It can fairly assume that until recent times, practitioners in the field did not consider such 'top leases' to be vulnerable. However, this case has been found to be the first case in which the rule of perpetuity has been advanced to void such a lease."

He agreed to pay support based on an imputed annual income of $17,386, although he remained unemployed. HELD: A trial of the issue was directed, as it could not be decided on the material filed whether he was intentionally unemployed or underemployed. The father's circumstances had changed since the consent order. The fact he no longer resided with a girlfriend and was making payments on a truck did not justify any reduction. Income should not be imputed based on former employment that is no longer available or practicable.","FIAT.

Although he remained unemployed, the respondent agreed to pay child support based upon an imputed annual income of $17,386 which is what he had been earning. HELD: 1) The real issue is whether the respondent is intentionally underemployed or unemployed within the meaning of s.19(1)(a) of the Federal Child Support Guidelines (SOR/97-175, as am.). 2) The Court cannot decide that issue on the basis of the material filed. No one knows if his former employment remains available or practicable or what efforts he has made to secure alternate employment."
c_2012nsca78.txt,", motion denied. While the province has an arguable appeal, it does not concern a summary judgment motion that would result in the claims being dismissed outright. If the certification order is struck, the province will still face individual claims. The AG has not shown that defending individual actions will cost less than defending one class proceeding. There is no evidence to estimate how it may incur significantly higher expenses as a result of how the points at issue in the appeal are resolved. The matter has been ongoing for some time and it is reasonable to expect the province has already spent time and money to prepare the defence they will eventually file. To succeed on this basis, the court would require a reliable indication of what remains to be done during the stay period, what component of that residue would be wasted if the appeal is allowed, and some estimate of that cost.","The plaintiffs sought a stay pending their appeal of a certification order in a class action. The defendants had not filed notice of defence and, pursuant to s. 4(6) of the Act, were not required to do so until 45 days after the certification order was issued. As part of their appeal, they brought an amended motion for stay that proposed class boundaries with a reduced area and an increased seven year habitation requirement offended the sensibilities of the plaintiffs. They also sought to have the certification hearing held at the Court of Appeal in Nova Scotia. Dismissing the motion, that the stay would cause irreparable harm in one of the two manners identified in the statement of claim: tort and for breach of fiduciary duty. Under the proposed certification plan, the plaintiffs' proposal to establish two classes of claimants property owner and residential is reasonable and logical and will facilitate the management and advancement of the case. There is no evidence of how the Province would incur expenses for its pleading or document disclosure. Vague and conclusory statements of counsel, without evidence, do not establish the prerequisites for stay of an enforceable order of the Supreme Court."
3_1995canlii4243.txt,"The appellant Board granted the respondent temporary total disability benefits on a part-time basis. The respondent contended that it should be on a full-time basis, and applied to the Supreme Court in chambers for an order quashing the appellant's decision. The chambers judge found that the appellant had ignored the clear words of s.37 of the Workers' Compensation Act in reaching its decision, and thus had exceeded its jurisdiction; the decision was quashed and the matter remitted back to the Board. The appellant appealed. Allowing the appeal and setting aside the order to quash, that s.37 of the Act was not a section limiting the Board's jurisdiction and that, considering s.37 and s.53 of the Act, the decision of the Board was not patently erroneous.","This was an appeal from a decision allowing an application for certiorari to quash a decision of the Workers' Compensation Board and remitting the matter to the Board to determine the rate of compensation payable to the respondent. The respondent had worked for several years for M-I Drilling Fluids Canada Inc. and experienced periods of layoff for as long as 2 years. In 1993, he was laid off full-time hourly employment. He was then laid off part-time casual employment. In 1994, the same employer engaged the respondent in two separate ways: contract employment, which included one eight hour day per week. In 1995, the respondent was employed as a property caretaker for which he was paid $100 weekly and, in addition, was given part time casual work. He sustained a back injury which rendered him no longer disabled. He appealed. Dismissing the appeal, that s.37 of the Act limited the Board's jurisdiction. The Chambers judge held that the Hearing Officer had ignored the clear words of s. 37 and had arbitrarily decided upon a different rate of pay. The Board was to determine whether the Board exceeded its jurisdiction. On appeal, Chipman, J.A. sought to overturn the Chambers judge's decision and set aside s.53(3) as the provision was subject to review for correctness. Chipman's decision was quashed and the matter was remitted to the board to determine rates of compensation in accordance with 37. The respondents appealed. HELD: The appeal was allowed and the decision and order were set aside. 1)The Board's interpretation was not unreasonable. There were no patently unreasonable errors on the part of the hearing officer. 2)There was no evidence that the Board was unable to function in the manner Chipman did in reviewing the Chambers decision."
b_1999canlii12407.txt,"The defendant, who was to install sewer and water lines on four lots for the hamlet, was charged with seven violations of the Occupational Health and Safety Act and Regulations. It had been agreed that the offences were strict liability. The principle issue was whether the defendant had an obligation imposed by law with respect to the workers and if so whether he discharged it by exercising due diligence in the circumstances. The essential facts were not in dispute. HELD: The defendant was found guilty on all offences.  1)There is a legal duty on an employer under the Act to take steps to supervise and oversee excavations to ensure the usual protocols for safety are met. This requires at a minimum the presence of an experienced person on site. Any reasonable person with some knowledge of worksite safety would insist that the walls be properly sloped, that there be at a ladder or other method to get out of the trench and that first aid supplies were readily available. Supervision is essential particularly when the worker is inexperienced. The deceased had had no experience in sewer and water trenching. No inexperienced person should be allowed to work on such a potentially dangerous site without proper training and specific guidance and supervision. The Law is specific on the requirements to be met for safety of the workers on excavation and sewer and water hookups. 2)The remedial progress report was ruled inadmissible. There was no formal comment on the issue of admissibility. 3)The Act does not define due diligence but well established case authority defines it as taking reasonable care to avoid causing harm which is prohibited by law. 4)The Act does not apply to a contractor. The relationship had all the ordinary indicia of an employer/employee relationship. The defendant controlled the project, tools and materials and bore the risk of loss or profit, had the ultimate responsibility for the worksite, completion of the project and the payment of wages.","The defendant was charged with seven violations of The Occupational Health and Safety Act, 1993 being Chapter 0-1.1 of the Statutes of Saskatchewan and Regulations made pursuant to the Act. The defendant had obtained a contract from the Hamlet to install sewer and water lines on four lots in St. George's Hill. This contract was arranged to be performed by using the services of an individual he knew who was hired to do the backhoe work on the excavation. The contract was for $15,000 and the defendant intended to use his nephew to lay pipe for the worksite. The nephew had no experience in trenching but most of the trenching experience he had was with the defendant. The relationship between the defendant and the workers was one of an employer to workers and the relationship was akin to that of master and servant or employer to employee. The essential facts of the case were not in dispute and they were fairly straight-forward. However, the defendant objected to the admission into evidence of remedial progress report that was simply marked for identification pending the ruling of the court. HELD: The report was inadmissible without addressing the technical aspects of the ruling or making a formal comment on the legal arguments put forth pro and con regarding the issue of admissibility.  1)Once one finds there was a legal duty on the defendant as an employer under the Act then his obligations under the law are to take active steps to supervise and oversee the excavations to make sure that the usual protocols for job safety are met. At minimum this would have required the presence of an experienced person on site. If the defendant did have a legal obligation did he discharge it by exercising due diligence in the circumstances? 2)The defendant did not recognize or give recognition to his responsibilities imposed by law on the workite. He was negligent. If he had taken reasonable care the 'accident would have happened since he would not have allowed such inexperienced people as myself and Shatilla to perform the work.  3)Once the legal obligations imposed by the Act are met the defendant has an obligation to take all reasonable precautions to prevent death or injury to the workers whom he was responsible for.  4)Once it was found there was no legal obligation to act within the meaning of the Act, the report was not admissible. It was unnecessary to leave it to another court on another day when the issue may be central to the decision on the matter."
c_2008nssm39.txt,"The applicant law firm applied for a taxation of accounts in a complicated family law matter. The client contended that there was obvious overbilling and that the solicitor was negligent in failing to specify in an interim Order the actual time at which she had to leave the matrimonial home. Accounts as presented are certified; there was no indication whatsoever of overbilling, whether with respect to legal fees or disbursements, and there was no negligence on the part of the solicitor as she had acted reasonably in relying on the representations of the husband's lawyer as to when the Order would be enforced. It is not always necessary to examine every single entry in detail on a line-by-line basis; an overall view of the entries contained in an account can be taken when assessing reasonableness. The temporal limitation of cross-examination is within the Small Claims Court's scope of discretion in special circumstances.","The applicant sought a taxation of the accounts that it issued to the respondent. The respondent opposed the application, alleging that the applicant's estranged husband had either been convicted of or plead guilty to a criminal charge and he did not pay a significant fine associated with the crime. The applicant argued that to limit cross-examination in such a manner would constitute a breach of natural justice. She also alleged that the respondent was negligent in the execution of a court order which granted interim exclusive possession of the matrimonial home and interim custody of the child of the marriage to her estranged husband. In response, the respondent made a motion requesting that she recuse herself because of an alleged apprehension of bias. Motion dismissed; the respondent's evidence regarding her retainer was sufficient to give the applicant some measure of relief from vexatious questioning. There was no evidence before the court as to why the respondent would have asked the applicant to cross-examine her. The evidence presented by the respondent and the applicant was straightforward and uncomplicated taxation. The trial judge thoroughly explained the procedure to be followed in the Small Claims Court Act and the court found that, in all of the cases examined, there was no bias on the trial judge's part. The threshold for establishing real or perceived bias was high. Mere suspicion or surmise was insufficient. There were a number of factors that a decision maker's participation in earlier proceedings involving the same party or parties who are again before the decision-maker in fresh, new proceedings does not, and should not, invariably lead to disqualification. Such prior participation as basis for disqualification, without something more, appears to be the exact type of shortcut in reasoning that is inappropriate in such cases of alleged apprehension."

The appellant's solicitor at the time of the trial had called no expert evidence concerning either the proper construction of the chimney, which was alleged to be faultily constructed, or the cause of the fire. HELD: The appeal was dismissed with costs on double Column V, including costs of the motion to adduce fresh evidence. 1)The evidence was clearly available, clearly contemplated by the parties and for whatever reason not called. 2)The trial judge neither misapprehended nor failed to take into account evidence which was before him in arriving at his conclusion concerning the causation of the fire. There was evidence to permit the trial judge to make the findings of fact that he did and to award the damages based on those findings.","The appellants applied to adduce fresh evidence and to amend the statement of claim in the within action. The tests for the admission of fresh evidence were set out in R. v. Lensen, 1987 CanLII (SCC), [1987] S.C.R. 672 and [1988] SCC, 80 Sask. R. 14 (Sask C.A.). The appellant contended that the expert evidence which he wished to tender was relevant, credible and if believed could reasonably, when taken with all the other evidence, be expected to have affected the respondent's residence. He candidly conceded that, with due diligence it could have been adduced at the trial. HELD: 1)The application was dismissed with costs on double Column V, including costs of the motion to add fresh evidence. 2)On appeal the Court held that it was not appropriate in the circumstances for the trial judge either misapprehended or failed to take into account evidence which was before him in arriving at his conclusion concerning the causation of the fire. There was evidence which would permit him to make the findings of fact that he did and to award the damages based on those findings."
1996canlii6900.txt,"A decree nisi and an order granting custody to the mother was made in 1995. Upon appeal the Court of Appeal directed a new trial. Changes in circumstances included the fact that the child was developmentally delayed and required a special program. A pediatrician testified that inconsistency in parenting approaches would further delay the child's development. HELD: Custody was awarded to the father. 1)Each parent was a capable caregiver. However, the father was available to provide full-time care due to an employment disability and exhibited a strong desire to do so. The past physical abuse of his former spouse was not considered relevant as it did not affect his ability to parent the child. 2)The mother was to have weekly access on two non-consecutive days for eight hours and two hours on a third day. The child was to sleep in the same bed every night.","Saskatchewan: Two parents sought custody of the child on the grounds that he or she was best able to meet her needs. The central issue was what custody arrangement would be in Sophie's best interests. Each parent presented volumes of evidence respecting the shortcomings of the other, all with the view of discrediting the other's ability to act as a custodial parent. HELD: 1)The issues arose in the context of a divorce action. 2)Each parent was a capable caregiver. 3)Because of his employment disability, he remains available to provide full-time care for the child and exhibits a very strong desire to do so. 4)To review all of such evidence presented during the five-day trial would be unproductive and lead to prolix judgment."
2006skqb189.txt,"FIAT: The issues on this application are with respect to extraordinary expenses and the quantum of spousal support. HELD: 1) The petitioner's income is $73,000 versus $29,000 for the respondent. The parties cannot agree if any of the expenses fall into s. 7 of the Guidelines as being extraordinary: $975 for child care, $500 for dance, $350 for school activities, and $1,140 for asthma medication. 2) The court does not believe that the 'reasonable coverage' definition contained in the May 1, 2006 amendment is new law. At best, it is a single test now enunciated in legislative form which should provide for more consistency and predictability as opposed to the many attempts to articulate a definition of extraordinary which is found in the case law. What items claimed are necessary to attain the child's best interests and yet are reasonable given the economic circumstances of the child and her parents? Which items might be reasonably covered by the sum of the parent's income plus child support? 2) The child care costs and asthma medication costs are of sufficient amount and peculiar to this child as to be extraordinary or not expected to be reasonably covered from the table amount of child support and the respondent's income.  3) With respect to spousal support, neither counsel referred to the spousal support guidelines and the formula for spouses with children which measures the difference between the individual net disposable incomes of each former spouse. These guidelines suggest that an award of between 40% to 46% of that difference in individual net disposable income be paid by the spouse with the higher INDI to the former spouse with the lower INDI. These guidelines create a rough ballpark of $900 to $1,100 per month in this particular case. However, the petitioner is bearing the full responsibility for family debt repayment in the interim. In order to pay creditors in a timely fashion, the petitioner has taken this responsibility onto his shoulders. In the circumstances, it is ordered that the petitioner pay to the respondent interim spousal support of $700. The consequent reduction of family debt is therefore a factor of this particular interim spousal support order and should not cause confusion when addressing any property issue in the future.","FIAT: The respondent moves for an order granting to her, (1) joint custody and primary care (residence) of the child, with access to her former spouse; (2) interim spousal support in the sum of $750 per month retroactive to January 1, 2006. The petitioner is not opposed to an order requesting (or more appropriately 'confirming') joint custody of the daughter, with the respondent being designated as the primary caregiver and the respondent's residence being the primary residence of the girl. HELD: 1) The parties agree the established status quo of shared parenting shall also be included in this order. The childcare costs and asthma medication costs are of sufficient amount and peculiar to the child as to be extraordinary or not expected to be reasonably covered from the table amount of child support and respondent's income. 2) The petitioner shall pay 71% of the childcare costs which is monthly sum $125 to both the petitioner and respondent. In the likely event that the petitioner's health plan covers the residual cost of Keandra's asthma medication not paid for by the respondent’s plan, the petitioner will bear 71 % of special or extraordinary costs if any are payable as consequence of this fiat. 3) The respondent was awarded costs of the application."
9_2001canlii390.txt,"The accused was charged with operating a motor vehicle while his ability to do so was impaired and while over .08 (breath sample readings were 160 and 150 mg) contrary to s. 253(a) and s.253(b) of the Criminal Code, respectively. Issues arising during the trial included whether there was a breach of his s.8 and s.9 Charter rights to be secure against unreasonable search or seizure, and not to be arbitrarily detained; if there was a breach, was there a remedy under s.24(2); whether the evidence was sufficient to prove the offence of impaired driving beyond a reasonable doubt. The police officer concluded that he had reasonable and probable grounds for the breath demand based upon the accused sleeping through two green traffic lights, a strong smell of alcohol, and his somewhat bloodshot or glassy eyes. HELD: The accused was acquitted of both charges. 1)The evidence was sufficient to establish breaches of s.8 and s.9 of the Charter. The Certificate of Analysis constituted conscriptive evidence which, on balance, would not have been discovered by alternative means. Its admission into evidence might render the trial unfair and bring the administration of justice into disrepute. In the absence of the Certificate of Analysis, the evidence was not sufficient to prove the offence under s.253(b) beyond a reasonable doubt. 2)The strong smell of alcohol and somewhat bloodshot or glassy eyes were not sufficient to conclude there were reasonable and probable grounds for the demand. The court is required to examine the evidence as a whole. Every case will depend a great deal on its individual circumstances. It was not reasonable for the officer to assume that the vehicle not moving at the lights was a reliable indicator of impairment for these purposes. The evidence of slurred speech was not reliable as there was nothing in the officer's notes regarding slurred speech, nor had it been included in the investigation documents. The accused did not have any problems with balance or manner of walk, was cooperative throughout, and did not have any difficulty understanding his rights and the breath demand read to him from a printed card. The officer did not ask the accused whether he had been drinking. 3)The nature and quality of the evidence of a strong smell of alcohol, and eyes which were somewhat glassy or bloodshot, in the context of Stellato, was so frail as to leave a reasonable doubt as to impairment. The 'classic' signs of impairment (erratic driving, strong odour of alcoholic beverage, glassy and bloodshot eyes, slurred speech and unsteadiness on one's feet) was not intended to be an all-encompassing list, and its application will very much depend on the circumstances of a given case.","The accused was charged with operating a motor vehicle while impaired, contrary to s. 253(a) and 253(b) of the Criminal Code; and with driving over.08, contrary with s.253(a). The accused was co-operative throughout and did not have any difficulty understanding his rights and the breath demand, which were read to him from a printed card. HELD: 1) In the circumstances herein, the officer observed the accused's vehicle sit through the green lights but thereafter, he responded immediately and awoke when he took hold of his wrist. As well, he appeared to fully comprehend the circumstances in which he was involved. However, the evidence of a strong smell of alcohol, and eyes which were somewhat glassy or bloodshot was not reliable evidence of impairment. The officer did not ask the accused whether he had been drinking. On the evidence, the accused walked him back to the police vehicle, and he did not observe any problems with balance or manner of walk. Therefore, he was not guilty of the offence of impaired driving.  2) In all criminal cases, the trial judge must be satisfied that, prior to convicting the accused, he's satisfied that his ability to operate motor vehicle was impaired by alcohol or drug. If the evidence is so frail as to leave him with a reasonable doubt as to impairment, he must be acquitted. In either event, the peace officer is vested with very important responsibility which is intended to ensure that members of the public are not subjected to the risk of impairment, and all of the serious consequences that may flow from it, in the absence of reasonable and probable grounds for making a breath sample demand. The accused's rights under s.9 of the Charter were breached and the evidence obtained from that breach should be excluded. 3) The evidence of slurred speech is not reliable. It was evident that the accused was immediately awakened when the officer grabbed him by the wrist and pulled him into the vehicle. He appeared to be fully comprehending the situation. The admission of the evidence into evidence might well render the trial unfair and bring the administration of justice into disrepute."
6_2005nssc128.txt,"Pursuant to the Corollary Relief Judgment, the parents had been equally sharing the parenting time of their two children for four years. The father now applied for interim sole custody, alleging that the ongoing extreme conflict between the parties was adversely affecting the children. An assessment recommended that the children live with the father and have access with the mother. Father granted interim sole care, custody and control of the children. The serious concerns raised by the assessment satisfied the threshold requirement of a material change in circumstances; the urgency of the concerns required immediate action.","The father applied to vary the terms of the parties' 2001 Corollary Relief Judgment respecting parenting. The parties had entered into a Separation Agreement in 2000 which was incorporated into the Corollaries Relief Judgment in May 2001. The father had been seeking sole custody of the children. The mother had refused to implement his recommendations, and had relied on the assessment to support her concerns. Application allowed; the father was to forthwith be placed in the primary care and custody of his father; the mother's position was that she wished to continue the shared parenting arrangement, but wanted the child psychiatrist, psychologist or therapist to be retained. Both parents were capable of caring for the children, but the current situation required immediate action. The evidence showed that both parents were unable to relax into the children's individual emotional needs and fully adjust their principles accordingly."
b_2018skca27.txt,"HELD: The appeal from conviction was dismissed and sentence appeal allowed. The sentence was varied to 12 months of probation. The court found with respect to each issue that: 1) the presumption of competent trial representation had not been displaced. The trial lawyer’s decision not to cross-examine the complainant was a tactical one. She was very young and had difficulty expressing herself in the courtroom whereas she had given clear, coherent statements to the police shortly after the offence. The lawyer determined that it was not beneficial to the appellant’s position to highlight those statements by raising certain inconsistences between them and the complainant’s testimony;  2) the trial judge’s assessment of credibility was entitled to deference. He correctly identified R v W.(D.) as the guiding legal principle in the circumstances and his credibility findings were supportable on the evidence; and 3) the sentence was unfit because denunciation and deterrence are secondary factors in sentencing young offenders and are to be considered in a fashion consistent with the principle of “diminished moral blameworthiness” described in s. 3 the YCJA. The court acknowledged that this offence, committed against an 11-year-old and causing her serious psychological harm, might warrant a custodial sentence but for the appellant’s exemplary conduct since the offence and the almost four years that had elapsed between the offence in 2012 and his sentencing in 2016. Under s. 3(1)(b)(iv) and (v) of the YCJA, the delay in this case offended the concept of timely justice. To impose a custodial sentence on the appellant in this case would be contrary to the purposes of the YCJA as it would impede the appellant’s rehabilitation and reintegration into society. The court decided that a fit sentence in this case would be 12 months of probation.","The appellant was convicted after trial of sexually assaulting his 11-year-old niece contrary to s. 271 of the Criminal Code. The appellant applied to admit into evidence the transcript of the first trial and an affidavit of the appellant's former babysitter, which outlines discussions between the appellant and his counsel prior to and during the second trial. HELD: The appeal was dismissed. The sentence appeal was allowed and the sentence imposed was varied to 12 months of probation. 1) The trial judge correctly identified R v W.(D.) as the guiding legal principle in sentencing youth to a high sentence. 2) The appellant had identified certain inconsistent statements in respect of which his counsel did not cross-examine the complainant, he has failed to establish these omissions amount to unreasonable professional judgment that reach the threshold of incompetence. 3) It is well understood that an appellate court must show great deference to a trial judge's assessment of witness credibility and that it may only interfere if the verdict 'cannot be supported on any reasonable view of the evidence'. Here, the trial judge committed an error in principle when he emphasized denunciation and deterrence as the paramount sentencing objectives. He erred in finding that the complainant's condition when she told the appellant she was 'consistent with someone having experienced this type of event' (at T140). 4) Given the seriousness of the offence and the fact that the appellant had received ineffective legal representation at the trial, and given the degree of responsibility he had to the appellant, there are no alternatives to custody that are reasonable in the circumstances. 5) There is no basis to interfere with a sentence simply because it would have been more likely than not that the accused would comply with the terms of a non-custodial sentence. The evidence satisfies the threshold for admission as set out in Worm. The conviction appeal is dismissed."
1997canlii11078.txt,"The applicant sought to be appointed as property guardian for his uncle pursuant to s19 of the Dependent Adults Act. The proposed dependent adult resisted the application and attributed his previous difficulty managing his affairs to a severe drinking problem but indicated that he had not been drinking for six years. The uncle had never been declared incompetent to manage his affairs. He voluntarily transferred the land left to him by his father and had allowed the trust arrangement to continue since 1951. Over the years, the land was transferred from the original trustees to various other family members and was presently registered in the name of the applicant nephew. There was no dispute that the uncle was the beneficial owner.HELD: The land was vested directly in the name of Selwyn Hand. The conditional stay in place pending the resolution of this application for the appointment of a property guardian was lifted. 1)The proposed dependent adult was capable of managing a significant portion of his business affairs and matters relating to his estate and property. However he required significant independent assistance in the management of the land held for his benefit. His suggestions and proposal to sell the land and travel were reasonable and financially modest. 2)The criteria set forth in s18 for the appointment of a property guardian was met and the Public Trustee was appointed to administer the balance of the proceeds from the land sale remaining after the uncle pursued his financial commitments and his dreams.  3)Costs in the amount of $7,000 were to be paid to the applicant in the event the uncle chose to sell his land. 4)Any proposed sale would be subject to the approval of the Court upon application of Hand. One half of the proceeds were to be provided directly to Hand to be dealt with as he chooses and the remaining half were to be administered by the Public Trustee in his longer term best interests according to the normal powers and procedures of that office.","The applicant sought the appointment of the property guardian pursuant to s. 19 of The Dependent Adults Act. The applicant was a 76 year old gentleman born in 1920. He lived in the Biggar area of Saskatchewan for many years and in 1994 moved to Estevan, where he established a relationship with a Mrs. Essex. He now sought to have the land registered in his name. HELD: The application was granted. The land was vested directly in the name of the petitioner. The court found that the petitioner was incapable of prudently handling money or property, was functionally illiterate, was concerned that if the land was transferred to the applicant he would lose the benefit of the land in a very short time. It ordered that the vesting order be postponed for 45 days to allow the petitioner to bring an application back. 1)The petitioner was entitled to manage his property unless he was not competent to do so. 2)As there were no facts in dispute in the matter before the court, the court directed that one half of the proceeds be provided to the petitioner in his capacity as property guardian to be reimbursed in recognition of the interests of the family in maintaining and preserving the asset."

Section 37 of The Wills Act permits the Court to order a document to be fully effective as a Will notwithstanding that it was not executed in compliance with all the formal requirements imposed by the Act.

The parties agreed to Gabrielson J. receiving the report and neither party sought to cross-examine the writer of the report. HELD: Leave denied. Even if there was a scintilla of merit to the argument, the Court would not grant leave to appeal on the basis that to grant leave to appeal on an extremely technical ground would cause delay that is manifestly not in the best interest of the child in the circumstances of this case.

The result favoured joining the federation. The applicant applies under The Non-Profit Corporations Act, 1995 seeking sundry relief, the net result of which would set aside the outcome of the referendum. HELD: 1) The test emanating from the Controverted elections cases are not applicable. In debates of this type, the preferred guidance is from the test articulated in Walton (Litigation Guardian of) v. Saskatchewan Hockey Association and the related cases dealing with non-profit organizations. In those cases, the Court does not ask itself whether the results have been skewed, but rather has the organization acted in good faith and generally in accord with the concepts of natural justice? This does not mean that there must be an exacting legal process or an application of the full 'panoply' of procedural natural justice issues. The question is has the organization acted in a fashion that meets the legitimate expectations of a fair-minded observer? 2) No reasonable observer could conclude that the USC approached the post-vote process in good faith or in a fashion that is in harmony with the broad rules of natural justice. When faced with a result (rendered by a procedure which it had specifically established for the referendum) which was not consistent with its wishes, the USC simply ignored its own rules and imposed its own preordained outcome. Accordingly, the Court concluded that the USC breached its obligation to act in good faith and conducted itself in a fashion inconsistent with natural justice. The applicant is entitled to a portion of the relief he seeks. The referendum held by the USSU on the issue of whether it should join the CFS is of no force or effect.","FIAT: In October 2005, a referendum was held within the student body of the University of Saskatchewan to determine if the Union should join the Canadian Federation of Students and its related corporation, CFS-S. The result favoured joining the federation. The applicant applies under The Non-Profit Corporations Act, 1995, c. N-4.2 (Act) seeking sundry relief, the net result of which would set aside the outcome of the referendum. The respondents argue that a plain and usual reading of s. 135 would confine the ambit of the word 'election' to that of an election of director or auditor. They suggest that it would be an error, and clear misreading of the section, to provide an expansive definition of election so as to encompass a referendum by a non-profit corporation seeking membership in a third party. HELD: 1) It would be counterintuitive not to add CFS as a party to the application. 2) In this jurisdiction such relief is discretionary. 3) The burden lies on the party seeking the right to cross-examine to show the examination will assist in resolving the issue before the chambers judge. 4) In Abrahamson v. Baker and Smishek (1964), 50 W.W.R. 664 (Sask. C.A.), the court addressed an application to declare an election invalid due to irregularities.

6_1999skqb124.txt,"The plaintiff who had been employed by the defendant's predecessor for 23 years as office manager and bookkeeper until 1997, brought an action for damages against her new employers for dismissal without adequate notice. The plaintiff took stress leave and requested to be relieved of her duties as office manager in 1998. The action proceeded under the simplified procedure in Part Forty of the Queen's Bench Rules. HELD: 1)The conduct amounted to constructive dismissal entitling her to withdraw services without a reduction in the notice period. Although the defendant had numerous complaints the plaintiff was not dismissed for cause. Her termination of employment related only to her reduced position as bookkeeper which was for an indefinite period of time. Her employment had already been terminated by notice of nearly a year. She remained entitled to notice to March 31, 1999 at her salary at the time of termination and to medical expenses that would have been covered but without bonuses or extra payments for sick pay. 2)The defendant did not establish the plaintiff ought to have done more to mitigate her loss. There was no basis for punitive damages nor for an extension of the period of notice.  3)The net earnings between May 1998 and March 1999 were deducted after deducting $50 for the cost of qualifying for that employment. Amounts owing by the plaintiff to the defendant were to be deducted. 4)The plaintiff was entitled to interest in accordance with the Pre-judgment Interest Act. 5)The defendant could make no deduction for insurance benefit payments.

But her employment had already been terminated by notice of nearly a year. 3)The theory of notice is that at the end of the period the employment insurance benefits will remain unimpaired unless contradicted by other affidavit evidence in which event it is difficult, if not impossible, for the Court to decide any fact solely on the basis of contradictory affidavits. 4)The Court drew the attention of the parties to s.45 and s.46 of the Employment Insurance Act, S.C. 1996. At issue was whether to issue judgment with the consent as to form and content of the other. Failing consent, the matter may be referred to me by application for further directions."
2003nspc24.txt,"A 14 year old accused her friend's father of touching her breast while she was sleeping over at his residence with her friend. She also stated that just prior to this she was awakened by the feeling of someone touching her vagina. The accused was charged with sexual assault and sexual touching of the complainant., accused found not guilty; the complainant's testimony was internally inconsistent and her cross-examination revealed obvious errors which were never corrected to rehabilitate her credit. The evidence was more impressionistic than probative of the facts alleged and the accused's evidence raised reasonable doubts in the court's mind.","The accused was charged with sexual assault and touching of the complainant. The complainant was a close friend of the accused's. She recalled that the accused had moved over and touched her breast and vaginal area while she was asleep. The accused testified that he had been in the living room when the complainant awoke and had left the room. At trial, the complainant testified that her friend had told her that her father had touched her in the act of removing her pyjamas and covering her with his hand. She alleged that this touching occurred after she had finished watching a movie with her friend and that when she awoke she felt something touching her. Although her description of the touching was described as accurate, her cross-examination revealed obvious errors which were never corrected to rehabilitate her credit. HELD: The accused was found not guilty as charged. The evidence was more impressionistic than probative of the facts alleged and the complainant was not persuaded, on the total evidence, that the Crown had proved beyond a reasonable doubt that it had proved. On the crucial issue of reliability, which was the consistency with which it accepted, the accused entered the guilty plea."
2005nsca64.txt,"The chambers judge refused to grant an adoption to a single mother of her own daughter as he determined that the child would not gain anything vis a vis the mother by such an adoption but would lose the potential for a relationship and support from her father. The evidence before the chambers judge was meagre but showed that the father had not seen the child for the past four years. The mother appealed., appeal dismissed; the chambers judge focused on the best interests of the child and did not fail to give appropriate consideration to the factors set out in the Act. He did not place too much emphasis on the child's loss of a potential relationship with and support from the father on the facts of this case.","The appellant single mother appealed the November 2004 decision of the Children and Family Services judge refusing to grant her the adoption she sought with respect to her four year old daughter. The appellant was not married at the time of the daughter's birth and remains single. The child's father has had no contact with her nor has he provided any child support since November 2000. It is not known if the appellant and the child have lived with the father or anyone else or if there is contact between the child and the extended families of either parent. The father was not notified of the application and has not consented. Notice of the proposed adoption was given to the Minister of Community Services as required by s.76(1) of the Act. The Minister did not make any recommendation regarding the adoption and did not conduct a home study. The chambers judge refused to grant the adoption on the basis that it was not in the child's best interests to do so even though he found all of the technical requirements for the adoption had been complied with. He agreed with the appellant that the child would continue to be in exactly the same position in terms of her relationship with her father whether the adoption was granted or not. The adoption will not change that relationship. HELD: The appeal was dismissed. The trial judge did not err in weighing the factors enumerated in s.3(2) in his determination of whether it was in the best interests of the child to adopt the child. He was left to consider 'any other relevant circumstances' under s.2(2)(n) in determining whether the proposed adoptions were in their best interests.  1)The only evidence before the trial judge was the usual documentation provided to court with an application for an uncontested adoption. On the facts the appellant did not erred when he balanced the neutral impact the adoption would have on the child’s relationship with the mother against the loss to the child of a possible relationship with and support from her father. 2)There was no evidence as to why there had been no contact and whether he was or is presently able to provide financial support for her and whether the appellant ever sought child support. It was not known how the child was supported from November 2000 when the father ceased support until February 2003 when the appellant started her current job. The Court found there was a net loss of possible contact, support and inheritance if the adoption were granted."
2_2003skpc44.txt,"The plaintiff sought to recover the purchase price and repair and inspection costs of a used vehicle pursuant to the Consumer Protection Act s.57(1)(b). Mr. Russell sold the vehicle under consignment to the plaintiff for $1,600. The sales agreement indicated the vehicle was sold 'as is'. The purchaser returned the vehicle the next day because of a problem with the seat belt, a vibration or pulsation from the brakes and the 'check engine soon light' had come on. The plaintiff paid for the sensor replacement. Triple R absorbed the other costs of repair. The plaintiff's daughter continued to have problems with the car including with lower ball joints, exhaust system and motor mounts. At issue was whether or not a consignee is a 'retail seller' as defined in the Consumer Protection Act. HELD: The plaintiff was entitled to recover the $1,600 purchase price plus foreseeable damages which included costs of repairs and inspection totalling $242.35 and costs of $20 less a reduction of $1,542.35 for the 5,000 km it was driven. 1)A consignee is a retail seller within the meaning of the CPA and accordingly Triple R was deemed to have given the warranties set out in the CPA. If the legislature had intended that consignees were not to be considered retail sellers, it would have listed them in the excluded group. Persons may be considered retail sellers even though they have no contractual relationship to the purchaser in s.55. 2)While the plaintiff did not pay a large sum of money, he could still expect this vehicle to be safe to drive. It was not safe and accordingly was not of acceptable quality. The retail seller bears the burden of establishing the exceptions enumerated in the statutory warranty and failed to do so. The vehicle was unsafe from the outset and could not be considered suitable for the purpose of providing transportation. It was unnecessary to make a finding with respect to warranty s. 48(g) (durable for a reasonable period of time). 3)This auto was substantially unfit for all the usual purposes for which, to the knowledge of the retail seller, it was being bought and accordingly the breach was of a substantial character. 4)The plaintiff rejected the goods within a reasonable period. The commencement of the present action was treated as the rejection of the product. The bulk of delay was caused by the defendant's failure to pick up and look at the vehicle (and implication this would involve repair) as agreed.","The plaintiff was not a partner in Triple R. Triple R was engaged in consignment auto sales upon the business premises of Triple R, with Triple R's knowledge and consent. The sole financial benefit for this activity was to go to the plaintiff. The vehicle was driven almost 5,000 kilometres. The plaintiff sought recovery of the purchase price and the costs that he had incurred for repair and inspection. HELD: Pursuant to subparagraph 57(1)(b) of the Consumer Protection Act, the plaintiff was entitled to recover $1600 plus foreseeable damages. The costs incurred for repairs and inspection were foreseeable and were properly recoverable. 1)The law of contract clearly recognizes that there is a consignment contract between the consignor (Mr. Oborowsky) and the consignment dealer (Triple R). There is also a contract (the sales contract) between Mr. Dillabough (the vendor) and Mr. Finch (the purchaser). However, in the circumstances the plaintiff is not interested in having the vehicle repaired, even if it is possible, in that he has obtained a different vehicle for his daughter. 2)Section 48 of the Act provides that the retail seller is deemed to have given ceratin warranties to the consumer. Most of the deemed warranties are not relevant to the present matter. Section 59(c) contemplates compensation to the vendor for same. 3)In the period between purchase and notification (a period of 82 days) it was not clear what the remuneration to the dealer was. 4)The plaintiff did reject the goods within a reasonable period. In the circumstances he did not take other steps to have the problem dealt with. Once he became aware of the seriousness of the problems, particularly with the engine mount, he proceeded with dispatch."
c_2017skqb144.txt,"HELD: The application was granted. The court ordered that the property be sold and the proceeds of sale take into account the amount necessary to protect the respondent father’s claim. The Partition Act, 1868 applies in the province. It did not allow the equitable principles of unjust enrichment and constructive trust to operate to create a proprietary interest. The court found that s. 4 of the Act applied, which provides a monetary remedy so that if the respondent father could establish entitlement to some amount for his maintenance and improvement costs, he would be protected for that amount for his costs.","The parties applied to partition and sale of a lake front recreational property owned by them and their brother. Each of the parties owns an undivided one quarter interest as tenants in common in the property. The property is located next door to another property that until recently was the permanent residence of the parents. They are now separated and may have to be sold. The parties argue that the benefit and corresponding detriment must have occurred without juristic reason. They claim that Ronald, through the operation of the principle of unjust enrichment and resulting or constructive trusts, has contributed over and above the contributions of the others. Ronald says that these improvements have made his property more valuable and that he is under no obligation to provide these materials or work. However, if it appears that Sale of the Property and Distribution of the Proceeds would be more beneficial to the claimant, he is entitled to an allowance for the improvements. In either case, the remedy of constructive or resulting trust will give the respondents collectively an interest in the Property greater than 50%. HELD: The application was allowed. The court had a limited discretion to refuse partition under s. and a broader discretion exists. It was available to the party defending the claim, when reasonable expectations and public policy are considered, to establish that juristic reasons exist to deny the claim. This opens the door to consider the manner in which the parties organized their relationship and whether an injustice has arisen that without equity cannot be remedied. 1) There are three elements that must be satisfied in order for a claim in unjust enrichment to succeed: there must be an enrichment of the defendant, corresponding deprivation of the plaintiff, and an absence of juristic reasoning. This necessitates determining whether it is s. or s. which operates in these circumstances. If this case is governed by s. the application will be allowed as cannot see anything in the evidence that suggests that the Applicants are motived by malice or are being vexatious as those terms have been interpreted in the case of Kerr Baranow. 2) This means that there is no reason in law or justice for the defendant's retention of the benefit conferred by the plaintiff. If so, then his total legal and equitable interest will reduce to less than one half which in turn will put the case into s. 3. Juristic reasons to deny recovery may be the intention to make gift (referred to as 'donative intent'), contract, disposition of law or other valid common law, equitable or statutory obligations. 3) If the parties hold one moiety (a half interest"

HELD: The plaintiff was awarded $30,737.93 plus costs plus pre-judgment interest. 1)The plaintiff had taken all reasonable steps to mitigate her losses. The duty is to take such steps as a reasonable person would take in his own interests to maintain his income and position in his industry, trade or profession. The former employer has no right to expect that the former employee will accept a lower paying alternative employment with doubtful prospects. 2)Reasonable notice would have been ten months.

She was the sole supporter of her family as her husband was unemployed. The plaintiff took all reasonable steps to mitigate her damages, including turning down an offer of employment from another company. HELD: The plaintiff was awarded 9 months salary in lieu of notice.  1)The defendant failed to mitigate the damages under the head of the head which was $2,946.00 per month. This was a case where a party already in breach of a contract demands positive action from one who is innocent of blame. 2)The plaintiff did not fail to mitigate against the damages owed by the defendant for the period of 9 months to be reasonable notice. 3)Pre-judgment interest was awarded in the amount of $1,325.00. 4)The trial judge was entitled to find the plaintiff justified in rejecting the offer.  5)Costs were awarded to the plaintiff for the sum of $30,737.93 plus costs. 6)In assessing reasonable notice in particular classes of cases, courts have traditionally relied upon the statement McRuer C.J. of the Ontario High Court in Bardal v. Globe Mail, [1960] O.W.N. 253, 24 D.L.R. 140 (HELP) 1)In this case, the plaintiff was 42 years old and was still unemployed at the time of the trial.

e_2005skqb549.txt,"There is no dispute between the parties as to the nature of the plaintiff's investment in the defendant corporation. The real issue between the parties is whether the plaintiff is entitled to the summary relief, which she now seeks pursuant to Rules 129 and 133 of The Queen's Bench Rules. It is the position of the plaintiff that the cross- examination of the defendant on his affidavit discloses that the corporation is profitable company and that s. 34(2) of The Business Corporation Act does not provide any defence to the defendants against the requested relief sought. The parties are in disagreement over the issue of the amount of dividend payments that have been made by the corporation to the plaintiff pursuant to her investment in the corporation. HELD: 1) The plaintiff's application for summary judgment does not require the corporation to redeem any redeemable shares. Rather, the plaintiff's application is one seeking summary judgment. The corporate defendant is not making payment to redeem shares, but rather following judgment however and whenever obtained, it would be subject to the normal judgment process, including execution. Such execution or enforcement of judgment is not tantamount to redemption of shares. The plaintiff provided notice in writing to the corporation that she wished to redeem all her Class E preferred shares effective March 2005. The principal amount of her shares is $214,600. It is this amount that she seeks as the substance of her summary judgment. Section 34(2) of the Act does not serve to prevent the plaintiff seeking summary judgment from the court. The effect of granting judgment, if it is otherwise appropriate to do so, does not place the corporation in a position of breaching the prohibitions contained in s. 34(2) of the Act. 2) The defendants have not demonstrated that there is real insolvency on the part of the corporation. The defendants have failed to provide responses to the undertakings. Further, the defendants have not provided any professional analysis or evidence in support of their position that s. 34(2) is applicable. 3) The amount sought to be recovered by the plaintiff does represent debt or liquidated demand as contemplated by Rule 129. The plaintiff is entitled to summary judgment against the defendant corporation for the sum of $214,600 pursuant to Rule 129. Further the plaintiff is entitled to interest at the rate of 16% from March 2005 in accordance with the Share Agreement. 4) The plaintiff has not demonstrated an appropriate basis for summary judgment against the individual defendants. 5) The plaintiff is entitled to costs.","The plaintiff commenced an action against the defendants seeking various items of specific relief and costs on solicitor-client basis. Thereafter, the plaintiff brought notice of motion seeking an order from the Court an order that the defendants provide an accounting in relation to specified items. The defendants denied any obligation to redeem the plaintiff's preferred shares, and asserted that they would be unable to pay its liabilities as they fell due. The plaintiff brought an application for leave to amend the statement of defence and an order pursuant to Queen's Bench Rule 129 for an order granting the plaintiff summary judgment for the sum of $214,600 plus interest at rate of 16% per annum. HELD: The plaintiff's motion does not require the defendant to make any payment to purchase or redeem any redeemable shares. Rather, the court is in agreement with her that the corporate defendant is not making payment to redeem shares in essence, but rather, following judgment however and whenever obtained, it would be subject to the normal judgment process, including execution. Such execution or enforcement of judgment is not tantamount to redemption of shares. The amount sought to be recovered by the plaintiff in this case does not represent debt or liquidated demand as that phrase is contemplated in s. 34(2) of the Business Corporations Act if summary judgment were granted in favour of the plaintiff. The realizable value of the corporation's assets would be less than the aggregate of its liabilities and the amount that would be required to be paid to other shareholders if the prescribed amount were met. There is no dispute as to the entitlement under appropriate circumstances under the terms of the relevant statutory provision. The cross-examination of the defendant on his affidavit disclosed that Peak has investments of $619,050, almost the entire amount of which constitutes the shares in Ascent. There are no other shareholders in the capital stock of Peak and none that would have right to be paying on redemption or in liquidation, rateably with or prior to the plaintiff as holder of the preferred shares. Peak is prohibited by statute, s.34(2), from disposing of its shares in any event of the cause. Pursuant to that statute, the Court may direct judgment under subrule (1) to be subject only to suspending execution, payment into court, assessment of costs, or otherwise, that the court considers appropriate."

The appellants appealed. They argued that the trial judge, by measuring the respondent's loss on the basis that he should be put in the position he would have been if the financial statements had been accurate, had applied the wrong test. Allowing the appeal reducing the damage award to $2,745,600, that the trial judge erred in the test he applied to the award of damages. The proper test is to put the respondent as far as possible in the position he would have been in if he had not invested in the company. The damages are the amount by which the actual value of the company was less than what the respondent paid at the time of purchase.","This was an appeal from an assessment of damages flowing from the appellant's liability to the respondent in tort for negligently prepared financial statements upon which the respondent relied in deciding to purchase the shares of a business. The appellant was a businessman living in Port Hawkesbury and the numbered company was his vehicle used to acquire the business. It was at this time that he had undertaken significant personal obligations and had used substantial additional funds at considerable risk. The trial judge concluded that the first approach was to be preferred as it looked at the company as a going concern on the transaction date rather than assuming liquidation at a future date. He therefore awarded direct damages of $200,000 representing lost return on investment opportunities for 7 years.  In the alternative, the respondent could have purchased the company earlier but for the trial judge's decision which awarded him $1,800,000 for direct damages."

The lottery money was spent on household finances and lost in husband's small business venture. Husband 'spent more money on alcohol than he should have'. HELD: This did not amount to dissipation of matrimonial property within the meaning of the Act. Husband's mismanagement of the family's financial affairs was grounds for unequal division of the property:","The applicant sought a division of matrimonial property, custody and maintenance under the Matrimonial Property Act, and custody of the two youngest children pursuant to The Deserted Wives and Children's Maintenance Act. The parties owned modest home and equity in the said home of approximately $16,000. The respondent borrowed money and bought some trenching equipment, which failed and resulted in substantial loss. The trenching business was repossessed, the matrimonial home had to be sold and the mini-motor home was gone. The family took more holidays and did more travelling. In the winter the respondent spent heavily on alcohol and spent more money on alcohol. He was in arrears of maintenance for the two younger children who were under the age of 8. HELD: 1)The respondent was responsible for the family finances and the finances from 1977 to 1981. He did not lose his licence and did not miss work because of his consumption of alcohol. 2)He was entitled to keep his 1977 Mercury motor vehicle and his tools in his possession as his own and to keep household goods and household goods in the possession of his wife in the amount of $1,800 for total of $18,240. 3)The applicant was to have her name and address shown on the property for purposes of the trial and to rent the lot in Hague for the purposes of that trial. 4)Allowing the application and leaving the property to be divided equally, that the respondent had not dissipated the property within the meaning of the Property Act and he was to pay child support accordingly. 5)With the exception of the one child who was to be given custody of his own in the lot, the court ordered that all assets be given to the applicant for the purpose of showing the property as belonging to her and leaving her name in the name of the children."
d_2007skqb418.txt,"The applicant asks that the Will be proven in solemn form to determine whether there was undue influence on the testator. HELD: The evidence from the lawyer who prepared the Testator's last Will was that she was concerned that the testator was being influenced. The evidence from the executor of the Estate raises no such concerns. Based on the evidence, the conflict in the evidence and the law, the issue of undue influence cannot be resolved without a trial of the issue. A trial is ordered.","FIAT: The sister of the deceased testator asked that a hearing be ordered to prove her last will and testament in solemn form. She also asked that an order prohibiting the administration or disbursement of the estate of the testator without leave of the court, until the issues referred to above are resolved by order of the Court or agreement of the parties. HELD: The issue of undue influence cannot be resolved without a trial of the issue. It is necessary so that the matter can properly be assessed by the Court.  1) The testator was deceased. He was bachelor. He had no children. His will went on to indicate that in the event that Bill Linkert failed to outlive him, Yvonne Tyler, his sister, was to be the executrix of his estate and sole beneficiary. 2) There was a general principle of probate law emanating from the case of Barry v. Butlin (1838), 12 E.R. 1089, which says this: If a will is prepared in circumstances raising justifiable suspicion that it does not reflect his mind and wish, then it is for those who propound the will to overcome the suspicion. 3) It is unlikely that any deliberate and overt act of coercion will ever occur in the presence of eye witnesses. The intent with respect to this portion of the order is that any necessary debts of the Estate would be paid. 4) The testsator shall be the plaintiff and shall bear the burden of establishing the deceased's knowledge and approval of the contents of the will.

e_2013skqb390.txt,"HELD: The Court sentenced the accused pursuant to s. 742.1 of the Criminal Code in force at the time of the offence that precluded the use of conditional sentence order for a serious personal injury offence, which included sexual assault. The Court found that the offences fell on the low end of the sexual assault spectrum as there was no skin to skin contact, the contact was brief and without violence or threats. The aggravating factors were that the accused had two previous convictions for sexual offences and that one of the victims had some cognitive disability. The accused was sentenced to a term of one year imprisonment for each count, followed by a term of probation of two years. The sentences were to be served concurrently.","The accused was found guilty, after trial, of two counts of sexual assault contrary to s. 271 of the Criminal Code. The accused was a 61 year old single male suffering from epilepsy who lived in Labrador and lived there until 1980 when he moved to Regina. He had two previous convictions of sexual interference on children, one of which was for a sexual assault which involved touching the complainant's breasts and vaginal area, touching the victim's spouse or common-law partner and touching her inappropriately. The complainant was on social assistance at the time of the offences and had a back problem which prevented him from gaining employment. The Court of Appeal assessed the accused's record at a low risk to re-offend, given his previous criminal record and his current state of mind. HELD: 1)Three years was the appropriate starting point for the sexual assault as it was a singular incident and the accused was not in a position of trust in relation to the complainant. The fact that this was a single incident of sexual touching that occurred over a few seconds gave rise to the idea that the accused, who had two prior convictions for sexual interference, was a high risk to offend again, even where he was without a criminal record. The appropriate range of sentence for R. v. Revet, 2010 SKCA 71, is a comparison between a sentence for fleeting touching and one for sexual assaults upon women who were incapable of giving consent due to being under the influence of alcohol, drugs or sleep, or combinations thereof. Two of the victims were children of the accused when the accused touched them and touched them on two occasions. The third victim was a young girl and her friend walked over to the accused and touched her on both occasions and touched the complainant on the breasts and upper chest. The touching was brief in both cases but no longer than minute according to the friend and after the touching the second victim told the accused that she wanted to kiss her and he told her to stop. The parties left the residence shortly after the incident. 2)The probation officer conducted two risk assessments in preparation of the pre-sentence report. The probation officer interviewed the accused prior to the hearing and found him to be at low risk for re-occurrence. He indicated that he only had one friend in Regina, but that he had 12 cats that kept him company. The trial judge sentenced him to nine months incarceration followed by 18 months probation. A conditional sentence order was not available in this case."
5_1994canlii5076.txt,"FIAT The accused, who was charged with two counts of sexual assault involving complainants 15 and 13 years of age, applied for a remedy under ss.24(1) of the Charter of Rights compelling the respondent to provide full disclosure to him, without trust conditions or undertakings of any sort. HELD: The imposition of trust conditions on the disclosure of victim's statements and videotaped statements in cases of sexual assault does not prevent the accused from exercising his right to make full answer and defence as guaranteed by ss. 7 and 11 of the Charter. The obligation to disclose is not absolute. The Corwn's obligation to protect the privacy of the complainants is fulfuilled by providing the statements and videotapes to counsel for the accused on trust condition that counsel retain them in his possession. The information contained therein is available to the accused and retained experts for use in preparing his defence. Since the accused knows the sustance of the complaints and, therefore, the case he has to meet, there is no danger to the fairness of the trial by virtue of the trust condition attached to disclosure. The public interest is served and the integrity of the criminal justice system is maintained when complainants are assured that staements and videotapes will not be reproduced. Application dismissed.","FIAT. A person charged with two counts of sexual assault applied for a remedy under s. 24(1) of the Charter and s. 650(3) of Criminal Code compelling the respondent to provide full and complete disclosure of the complainant statements. HELD: 1)The material filed by the Crown was sufficient to establish a considerable problem with wrongful use of complainant statements generally but not the degree in which it exists in this jurisdiction. The Court of Appeal made specific mention of the respondent's failure to provide copies of certain disclosure material to the defence. 2)The respondent was aware that his rights pursuant to s. 7, 11(a) and 11(d) were violated. It is important to note that the respondent specifically contemplated the giving of an undertaking by defence counsel that 'victim statements, written and videotaped, would not be allowed to the public... except in accordance with the terms of the Order'. 3)The Court was also aware that in some cases defence counsel was restricted by the order to make disclosure materials available only to those persons whose examination or possession of the material is in good faith necessary to prepare and conduct the defence of the said charge. 4)In this case the defence counsel did not abandon his first and basic position that he was entitled to disclosure without a condition or undertaking. He was able to review the statements and videotapes on his own and away from the office of counsel, and his right to use them as claimed were not essential to provide disclosure or to ensure the right to privacy of the two complainants. This assurance of privacy encouraged victims to come forward with their complaints. 5)The applicant was granted an undertaking that he would not make copies of any videotape of interviews with the complainant or watch any videotapes except with his counsel or expert witness retained on his behalf. The stay of proceedings entered by the trial judge was not warranted. 6)The Crown did not provide an undertaking respecting the protection of the confidentiality of the videotape. The court was satisfied that disclosure in criminal proceedings is a fundamental right and must be made available to the best of the possible."
e_2013skqb434.txt,HELD: The Court granted the application. It held that: 1) a solicitor-client relationship was created between the applicants and the defendants based on the evidence; and 2) that the applicants had not rebutted the presumption that they had received confidential information during the meeting that was relevant to the plaintiff’s action against the defendants. That finding was sufficient to disqualify them for acting for the plaintiff.,"The sole issue is whether the plaintiffs and their lawyer should be disqualified from continuing to act for the plaintiff because of a conflict of interest. HELD: 1) The court found that the Holgates and the lawyers with Phillips Co. were both ethically bound by the Rules of the Law Society of Saskatchewan to refrain from acting against their former client in the same or any related matter. At its core, the action between the parties pertains to the terms of the agreement for sale, which is the same matter, or at the very least, a related matter to the original retainer. That alone is sufficient to justify their disqualification.  2) As the Phillips & Co. law firm have failed to rebut that presumption, the court must presume the plaintiffs imparted confidential information to the lawyers in that law firm. Simply put, there was no delay."

The complainant swore she tried to flee several times after the melee in the hotel room, but was prevented by the defendant, who was senior and more experienced in the trades, being at large on his Recognizance entered into before a Justice or a Judge and being bound to comply with a condition that he not contact or communicate directly or indirectly with the complainant, except through a member of the Law Society of Saskatchewan, but that he had paid for everything, including the drugs and liquor, and had not been arrested as he was back in the province. HELD: The defendant was convicted of both charges. Criminal Code s.34(1) requires that a person who is strong and who hit the victim twice in the face be, at the very least, reckless in his use of force. Here, the defendant was not unlawfully assaulted by the complainant. The defendant initiated the attack by choking her and she grabbed his testicles in one hand and initially clawed at his eye, but he said nothing of any scratches or injury in the area nor was anything like that noted by the paramedic at the Rocanville mine. The evidence raised no doubt as to the defendant's guilt on either charge."
d_1996canlii7113.txt,"The question was whether a corporate board could breach its undertaking to remain in a small community when it had taken advantage of the government sponsored community bond program in order to establish its business. The Shareholders' Agreement obliged all shareholders to vote their shares so as to confirm the nominees of certain shareholders, thereby freezing the board composition without regard for its performance. As a result the board was dominated by the original Precision group of shareholders and even though the Government of Saskatchewan and Bondco were entitled to enough votes to exercise control of the company, they could not change the board and did not have the usual ways of enforcing their wishes. Members of Bondco were concerned that jobs were being obtained in Saskatoon at the expense of Rosetown jobs and the economic spin-offs expected from their $800,000 investment were not being realized in Rosetown due to the opening of the Saskatoon facility. An application was brought under s234 of the Business Corporations Act. They sought a restraining order enforcing the covenant, an order appointing new directors, an order of compensation for breach of contract and an order directing the closure of the Saskatoon operation and the return of company assets to Rosetown district unless Bondco granted written consent. HELD: It was ordered that 1)the Shareholders Agreement was amended deleting the offending paragraph concerning the Board of Directors and substituting a new paragraph; 2)certain provisions of the Articles of Continuance as amended were suspended until the Termination Date; 3)the present board was suspended pending the election of directors at a special meeting of shareholders; 4)the respondent was enjoined from moving its operations and from transferring or hiring employees at any place other than Rosetown District unless Bonco's written consent was filed with the Court. 5)The Chief Executive Officer was not displaced nor was the Saskatoon operation directed to be closed.  6)Bonco was entitled to its taxable costs against the individual respondents.","A motion raised the question of the right of a corporate board to breach its undertaking to remain in a small community when it had taken advantage of the government-sponsored community bond program in order to establish itsbusiness. HELD: 1)The board was dominated by the original shareholders and its supporters were high-handed and oppressive. The actions of the directors on the board had been highhanded and abusive. The plaintiff was fully entitled to the assistance of the court in rectifying the matters complained of. 2)The applicant was ordered, pursuant to s. 234(2) of the Business Corporations Act, to remove the president and CEO of the corporation and to take appropriate steps to consolidate its operations. 3)The director was to be directed to withdraw from Saskatoon and any employees or contractors who had obtained a written consent to move to Saskatoon may be compelled to do so as required by the terms of the agreement."

While there was no direct evidence to establish the plaintiff set the fire himself, the inference was drawn that he did or, in the alternative, caused someone else to do so.  2)Had the plaintiff been in the mobile home he should have been suffering to some degree from carbon monoxide poisoning, he should have been coughing, his hair should have been singed, he would have had soot on his face and his clothes would have smelled of smoke. 3)The plaintiff did not call evidence to rebut the fire investigator's opinion that a significant quantity of fire accelerant had been used nor was his brother called to confirm his testimony that he attempted to re-enter the mobile home after arranging for the fire department to be called.","The plaintiff's residence, mobile home and contents were insured with the defendant who had denied liability alleging that the plaintiff intentionally started the fire or caused it to be started.

All of the evidence going to the question of whether there was just cause for the appellant's dismissal was eminently suited to assessment by jury. Some of the issues, such as those relating to damages, could have been withdrawn from the jury. 2)Had the plaintiff shown cogent reasons why she should be deprived of her right to trial by jury by giving jury notice, the questions that arise are questions of law rather than fact. Where possible questions of fact should be separated from purely legal issues and such questions as whether or not the parties went through marriage ceremony is a factual matter.

The medical evidence conflicted as to whether the injuries were the cause of the continued pain. Awarding $25,000 valued at date of judgment with an adjusted interest rate. The court found the injury was mild and not the cause of the continued pain. The plaintiff was found to have chronic pain syndrome.","The plaintiff was injured in a motor vehicle accident when his vehicle was struck by the defendant's vehicle. The plaintiff had worked as a technician for several years and claimed damages for personal injuries as a result of the accident. The defendant claimed general damages of $25,000.

8_2009nssc261.txt,"The Trustee opposed the bankrupt's application for a discharge on various grounds. The bankrupt supported four children and had been discharged from the military due to illness arising from her active service. The bankrupt will be entitled to an absolute discharge once certain conditions are met, including the payment of one month's rent, the value of the horses and surplus income for nine months to the Trustee. The bankrupt's disability pension from Veterans' Affairs was not included in the calculation of surplus income as the public policy reason behind the exemption for proceeds received due to personal injury and a soldier's danger pay applied to this disability pension. The Trustee had no claim to the insurance proceeds received by the bankrupt following the loss of her home by fire as it was a modest sum used to replace lost personal exempt assets; the three horses were found to be owned by the bankrupt as opposed to her children, for whom she had purchased them as pets and were included in the value of her estate; the court exercised its discretion in determining the amount of surplus income, noting that the administration of the estate had been unusually hostile and it was important that the bankrupt be able to stabilize her family finances.","The respondent asked that she be discharged from bankruptcy as she suffered from Post Traumatic Stress Disorder, Major Depression Disorder and Borderline Personality Organization. These illnesses entitle her to a pension from the Department of Veterans Affairs. She refused to cooperate with the Trustee on this application and argued that they were assets of the estate and that she should be compensated for the loss of her household goods which were taken from her in the event of her bankruptcy. HELD: The respondent was entitled to an absolute discharge. 1)The respondent was not asked to make detailed analysis of what is exempt and what is not exempt. The evidence at the hearing was that she did not. 2)She had little time to make arrangements. She incurred expenses in moving. She had to act quickly under very stressful circumstances. 3)There are other ways to determine surplus income, such as under the Judicature Act, or under the Civil Procedure Rules whereby this information might have been obtained and possibly may now be obtained. It is well established law that any cause of action arising from bodily injury, mental suffering, or injury to reputation or character or the proceeds thereof is personal and does not vest in the trustee. The Trustee requested that the matter of the horse trailer be resolved. She was asked to compensate the trustee for one month's occupation of the home. 4)Costs for transportation were included in the calculation of surplus income. 5)There was no evidence to determine the approximate value of exempt assets against what might be demanded of her for rent. It should be noted that depreciation is an element of necessity which does not extend to horses used for recreation. The only material before me helpful in determining value is the report from Barbara Claussen. Her report suggests a meat price of $400 for the older mare. 6)There were no costs."
d_2012nssc139.txt,"The applicant is the only drug store in a rural community. The respondent worked there for 30 years, in various positions. He signed a 5-year, 10 mile non-competition clause in 1995. He quit in early March with the intention of opening a new drug store down the street in early April. Other key staff members intended to quit and work in the new store. The applicant moved for an interim injunction to prevent the respondent from opening his store pending the hearing of their motion for an interlocutory injunction. Interim injunction granted. The new Civil Procedure Rules (2008) distinguish between interim and interlocutory injunctions. This is one of the circumstances which was contemplated when the new Rule 41.04 was enacted. Urgency exists and the applicant can't wait. While the non-competition clause may well not survive a challenge at the full hearing of the interlocutory injunction motion, all the applicant needs to show is that there is a serious issue to be tried. There is. This isn't a frivolous or vexatious application. There's a high potential for the applicant to suffer irreparable harm (e.g. the loss of customers, market share) especially given that this is a small community. An interim injunction will only result in a delay of a few weeks. The interlocutory injunction is set to heard at the end of April. The stakes are higher for the applicant than they are for the respondent.","The plaintiff brought a motion for an interim injunction in order to prevent the defendant from operating a competing drug store within 10 miles of the plaintiff's business. The defendant had resigned from the company, leaving the plaintiff with only a few weeks to gather all the evidence it wished to present on an interlocutory motion. The plaintiff's motion was not frivolous or vexatious. There was a high potential for irreparable harm to the plaintiff company (the loss of customers, market share, though difficult to quantify, is real and is the type of harm contemplated by this branch of the test) and the balance of convenience favored the plaintiff. Interim injunction granted. Although the plaintiff was facing a serious threat to its business if the defendant's non-compete agreement was not exercised, the impending and imminent opening of a new business satisfies the requirement that of 41.04 2(c).

The Court had earlier acquitted the accused on the charge of driving while disqualified as there was no evidence regarding the status of the accused's driver's licence. At issue was whether the GiO cycle or moped which the accused was operating was a motor vehicle as defined by the Criminal Code. The accused asserted that his GiO bike was operated that night by pedaling it as the electric motor was not working and asserted that driver's licence was not required to operate the GiO bike nor was he required to put licence plate on it. HELD: The accused was found not guilty of the charges before the Court. There was no evidence that the electric motor on the GiO bike was operational that evening and the officer testified that he observed the accused dragging his feet while driving the moped.,"The accused was charged with impaired driving and operating a motor vehicle while disqualified. The issue before the court was whether the accused was pedaling his bike as his sole means of propulsion and whether the electric motor was operable. HELD: The accused was found not guilty of the charges of driving while disqualified and failure to provide a breath sample. 1)The accused had been member of the Regina Police Service for four and one half years. He was on general patrol duty in his police vehicle which was proceeding westbound on Broad Street. As the police vehicle approached the intersection of Broad Street and Broad Street against a red light, they observed a driver on a moped pedaling it. The police vehicle activated its lights and followed the moped. The motor vehicle was not operating as defined by the Criminal Code and the accused blew into the approved screening device twice. His first breath lacked sufficient pressure to activate the device. His second breath registered a fail result. 2)There were some problems with the evidence of the police officer. One particularly troubling aspect of his evidence concerns the lack of detailed observations respecting the accused's GiO bike. The officer testified that he observed the accused pedaling the bike with both of his feet close to the ground, rather than resting on the floor board as was the norm. The accused is presumed innocent and bears no burden to prove anything. After considering the whole of the evidence, if there is a reasonable doubt on any element of the offence, he must be found guilty."

The accused had been in custody since November 2004.

e_2014skqb265.txt,The determination of whether the trial judge’s conclusion regarding the officer’s suspicion was reasonable was question of law subject to the correctness standard. The respondent conceded that the officer had the requisite subjective belief that he had alcohol in his body so the appeal centered on whether the objective test had been met. The appeal court did not find any basis to disturb the trial judge’s finding of fact as to the factors the officer based his suspicion of alcohol consumption on. The court noted the trouble with the fact that the respondent admitted to drinking alcohol that “evening” but the stop was at 5:00 am in the morning. The trial judge disregarded the respondent’s admission to drinking because there was no smell of alcohol and the trial judge said there should be if the consumption was recent. The court concluded that the trial judge erred in dismissing the alcohol consumption admission. A reasonable person would have assumed that the officer’s question was with respect to recent consumption of alcohol not an earlier irrelevant time. It was also found reasonable for the officer to believe the consumption was recent. The court concluded that a reasonable person standing in the officer’s place would reasonably suspect that the respondent had alcohol in his body. An answer by an accused person that they have been drinking was found to be stronger support for a suspicion than the smell of alcohol. Because the respondent’s Charter rights were not breached a new trial was ordered.,"The accused was charged with impaired driving, contrary to s. 253(1)(a) of the Criminal Code and operating a motor vehicle when the concentration of alcohol in his blood exceeded 80 milligrams of alcohol per 100 millilitres of blood, which resulted in breach of s. and s. s. of the Charter. The Crown appealed the acquittals of the accused and the conviction of impaired driving. At trial, the accused challenged the reasonableness of the investigating officer's suspicion upon which the officer based his ASD demand. The trial judge determined the officer was not deliberately trying to violate the accused's rights, but his dealings with the accused were less than what society should expect from a police officer who has been trained in the use of the ASD. HELD: The accused was acquitted of both charges. The Court held that the trial judge specifically found that the officer relied only on three factors in forming his suspicion: his nervousness, his lack of desire to tell the officer what he was doing and the fact this incident occurred at 5:12 in the morning. There was no basis for disturbing this finding of fact."

HELD: The sentence was varied by reducing the term of probation to 1 year and by deleting the provisions concerning possession and consumption of alcohol, entry into premises where alcohol is sold and consumed, and submission to breath or blood testing. A period of probation was appropriate but 3 years was out of proportion to the nature of the offence. The inclusion of a term prohibiting him from consuming alcohol was inappropriate since it had no relation to the purpose of the original recognizance.","The offence was for the purpose of preventing further sexual offences against persons under the age of 14 years.

c_1998canlii14058.txt,"FIAT. An application pursuant to Rule 188 for a determination of whether the defendant was liable pursuant to s86(1) of the Highway Traffic Act for the personal injuries of the infant plaintiff or was immune from liability by virtue of s228 [now s232] of the Education Act. The second point of law to be determined was whether the co-defendant as car owner was liable if the driver was found to be immune from liability. The motor vehicle accident occurred while the infant plaintiff was being transported during a field trip, approved by the defendant school board, and the defendant was the teacher. HELD: 1)The teacher/driver was acting within the scope of her duties and was immune from liability by virtue of the Education Act. 2)The owner was only liable to the same extent as the driver. The reasoning in Neault was directly on point. Just as the Workers' Compensation Act and the Highway Traffic Act prevent the injured worker from suing the owner of the vehicle because he is prevented from suing the driver, the Education Act extends the same immunity to the owner as it does to the driver by operation of s86(1) of the Highway Traffic Act. 3)There was no apparent conflict between the statutes. When read together, the legislation provides that a negligent teacher is granted immunity from liability if the teacher has acted within the scope of the Education Act. The Traffic Act is the general statute, governing liability of all drivers. The Court did not agree with the School Board's analysis that the Education Act was the general statute. 4)The injured plaintiff was not denied a party to sue for negligent operation of a vehicle as he had recourse against the school board and its insurer. The immunity under the Education Act only applies to teachers and principals.",FIAT: An application for determination of whether the defendant is liable for s. 86(1) of the Highway Traffic Act for the personal injuries suffered by the infant plaintiff and whether the school board is immune from liability by s. 228 of The Education Act. HELD: 1)The Education Act specifically provides an immunity to a teacher from liability when acting within the scope of s.228 of the Act. The immunity only applies to teachers and principals.  2)There was no apparent conflict between the statutes. The school board was not in favour of the Board. The plaintiff was not liable to the board. 3)In the event the board was unable to find the employer of the motor vehicle the teacher's immunity extended to the owner of the vehicle.  4)The school board's action against the co-defendant was dismissed.
5_2004skqb417.txt,"Each party has applied for a variation of the judgment granted by Gunn J. in April 1999. The judgment incorporates the terms of an Interspousal Contract dated April 1999 that provides for basic child support to be paid by the petitioner in the amount of $1,411 per month. The calculation of child support in the Interspousal Contract was based on the petitioner earning $110,000. The petitioner seeks to have child support reduced for Kimberly and discontinued for Ashley. The petitioner has unilaterally terminated support for Ashley on the basis that she is over 18 years of age and not in full time attendance at school. The respondent seeks an upward variation of ongoing child support for Kimberly on the basis that the petitioner's income is significantly higher than $110,000. She also seeks a retroactive variation of support paid for both girls. HELD: 1) The parties agree that much of the petitioner's income since the separation has included significant amounts of non-recurring income in the form of capital gains, stock options and severance pay. In accordance with s. 16 of the Guidelines, a payor's income for child support purposes is determined based on total income, adjusted in accordance with Schedule III, as shown on his or her income tax return. The petitioner has provided no compelling reason to exclude any of his non-recurring income. To the contrary, it is the fairest way of proceeding. The petitioner's income since separation discloses that non-recurring income can realistically be anticipated in the future, as it has constituted a significant portion of his income in four of the last five years. The fairest way of determining the appropriate level of child support is by calculating it based on his income during the previous year. 2) The petitioner's line 150 income on his 2003 income tax return was $199,922. This includes $114,454 of non-recurring capital gain income from the sale of shares in Poplar Hill Resources. It does not include the non-taxable portion of that capital gain in the same amount. Pursuant to Clause 6 of Schedule III referred to in s. 16 of the Guidelines, this non-taxable amount is to be included as an adjustment to income. This results in the petitioner's 2003 income for child support purposes being $314,376. However, in examining documents provided by the petitioner regarding his previous year's income, it is apparent that he incurred net capital losses in 2002 of $65,424. The Court imputed $150,000 of income to the petitioner for the year 2002 despite this net capital loss and his line 150 income being only $2,410. It is therefore reasonable that this capital loss be deducted from the non-taxable portion of the capital gain he realized in 2003. This results in only $49,030 of the non-taxable portion of the 2003 capital gain being added to income for total income of $248,952. Based on the Guidelines, child support of $1,928 would be payable for Kimberly.  3) During the same year that the petitioner was enjoying income in excess of $248,000, the respondent's income for herself and the two children was only $24,345. It is self-evident that the petitioner has a substantially greater ability to provide financial support for Kimberly than does the respondent. In the circumstances it is appropriate that one-half of the Guideline amount for the petitioner's income in excess of $150,000 be payable as child support. Effective January 1, 2004, the petitioner shall pay monthly child support for Kimberly of $1,557.  4) Ashley did not complete grade 12 until June 2003. In the normal course, she would have graduated in June 2002, but she was short some classes. The required classes were not available in September 2002 so she did not return to school until the new semester in January 2003. Although Ashley was not in full time attendance in school during the last six months of 2002, she had not yet completed her basic education and had every intention of doing so. She was not in a position to withdraw from her parent's support. Considering the disparity in the ability of each of her parent to contribute to her support, it is appropriate that support for Ashley be the amount determined by applying the Guidelines as if she were a child under the age of majority.  5) A written request by the respondent for the petitioner to provide copies of his income tax returns is not required because the parties incorporated a positive obligation to exchange tax returns in their Interspousal Contract. Consistent with the objectives of the Guidelines and implicit in the Interspousal Contract the parties must have understood that the petitioner's child support obligation could change if his income changed. 6) This is clearly a case where a retroactive variation is warranted. No variation can be considered for 1999, the year of the Interspousal Contract and the judgment. Given the various sources of the petitioner's income and the significant annual fluctuations in his income, it is appropriate to use his previous year's income as the basis for calculation of his child support payable in the subsequent year. The Court went on to calculate the petitioner's income and the child support payable for each year. 7) In 2002 the petitioner's line 150 income was only $2,410. Given the pattern of the petitioner's income in the three preceding years, along with the fact that he disposed of capital assets in 2003 that generated undisclosed cash flow, and, some 2 years later, he nevertheless retains significant net assets, the Court imputed additional income to the petitioner of $150,000 for child support purposes. 8) The respondent was awarded costs set at $2,600.","Each party applied for a variation of the 1999 child support judgment. The 1999 judgment incorporates the terms of an Interspousal Contract which provides for basic child support to be paid by the respondent in the amount of $1,411 per month. Negotiations proceeded slowly and the respondent eventually countered with an application for variation in March 2004. The respondent seeks an upward variation of child support for Kimberly born April 2, 1992 and entirely discontinued for Ashley born April 4, 1984. The parties agree that much of their income since separation has included significant amounts of non-recurring income in the form of capital gains, stock options and severance pay. It is self-evident that the respondent has a substantially greater ability to provide financial support for the children than does the respondent. HELD: 1) Based on the Guidelines and an annual income of $248,952, it is reasonable to impute additional income to the respondent for 2002. The guideline amount or some other amount should be used to calculate child support. This is clearly a case where a retroactive variation is warranted. Given the various sources of income for the respondent's income and the significant annual fluctuations in his income, it was appropriate to use his previous year's income as the basis for calculating the Guidelines as if she were a child under the age of majority. In these circumstances, she was not in a position to withdraw from her parent's support. 2) The respondent was entitled to her costs."
d_1998canlii4665.txt,"The primary issue in this appeal was the standard of review to be applied on appeals from a Hearing Officer to the Workers' Compensation Appeals Tribunal. The appellant had his appeal denied on the grounds that the decision of the Hearing Officer was not patently unreasonable. Allowing the appeal and remitting the matter for re-hearing, that an appeal from a Hearing Officer to the Tribunal is a statutory appeal. It is not a judicial review, and the standard of review is therefore one of correctness not whether or not the Hearing Officer's decision was patently unreasonable. The deference that the Tribunal must show is only with respect to the advantages the Hearing Officer may have in the fact finding process of a particular case.",This was an appeal for which leave was granted from a Worker's Compensation Appeals Tribunal decision. It was limited to question as to the jurisdiction of the Tribunal and to the usual appellate deference to trier of fact. This appeal was allowed and the matter was remitted to the Tribunal. There was no reason to think that the Tribunal is any less expert generally in matters relating to workers' compensation that fall within s. 243(7) than the hearing officer. The concept of patently unreasonable decision had no place in this statutory appeal process.
3_1996canlii6732.txt,"The plaintiff sued his father's estate for breach of a farm lease and for the value of his farm labour. The estate counterclaimed for a mortgage debt incurred by the father on behalf of the plaintiff. The plaintiff was not included in his father's Will as a beneficiary and the Will contained no reference to the mortgage debt. The father's statement of assets filed in his divorce and matrimonial property action did not disclose it as an asset. HELD: 1)The unsigned handwritten memorandum evidenced a binding agreement for lease between the plaintiff and his father. He affirmed the lease in his discussions with a daughter. 2)The plaintiff neither repudiated the lease nor failed to complete his obligations under it.  The fact that he did not vigorously contest the right of his brother to farm the land on behalf of the estate did not estop him from suing for damages for his father's breach of the lease.  Damages of $6,500 were awarded. 3)The plaintiff failed to establish a quantum meruit claim. He did not produce any documents to show he had been reimbursed for his labour on the farm in prior years. Other family members helped with the farming from time to time. He did nothing while his father was alive to demand or obtain payment. 4)Even if the mortgage was considered a debt in 1989 it was subsequently forgiven. It was significant that the plaintiff was not included as a beneficiary and the amount of the mortgage was similar to the bequests to the other children. 5)The plaintiff was awarded his costs against the estate on a party and party basis for that portion of his claim on which he was successful and for defending the counterclaim. Solicitor and client costs against the estate were not appropriate as the issues raised by the claim and counterclaim were not typical estate issues. Judgment issued against the two executors in their representative capacity.","The plaintiff sues his father's estate for damages for breach of a farm lease and for a mortgage debt incurred by the deceased on behalf of the plaintiff. The issues raised by the claim and counterclaim are not typical 'estate' issues. HELD: 1)The plaintiff was only entitled to the net return he would have realized had he farmed the land in accordance with the lease in 1993. 2)The $17,800 mortgage (and interest) granted by the father to Farm Credit Corporation to clear his land from a Bank of Montreal mortgage is not debt enforceable by the estate. Peter neither repudiated the lease nor failed to complete his obligations under it.  3)In the circumstances the fact the plaintiff did not vigorouslycontest the right of his brother to farm the land with him does not establish his quantum meruit claim. By his own conduct he did nothing to obtain payment for his labour while his father was alive. 4)The value of the deceased's assets were $19,016.67 as at the date of the father's death in 1994. The value of his net return as a result of the farm labour expended in 1993 was $6,500."
b_2016skpc86.txt,"HELD: The court found that the child was in need of protection under s. 11(b) of The Child and Family Services Act, that his parents were unable to care for him, and that physical or emotional harm was likely to occur to him. J.A.’s mother was found to be a person of sufficient interest under s. 23 of the Act. The court ordered that the child should be placed in the custody of J.A.’s mother as a person of sufficient interest for a period of four months pursuant to s. 37(1)(b) of the Act. The child’s parents should have adequate access to build their relationship with him and to allow them, with the assistance of others, to come up with a plan that would allow them to eventually care for their child.","The child was apprehended at birth by the Minister of Social Services but the Minister did not proceed with the application and the child was allowed to take home with her. The child had diminished cognitive abilities, as she suffers from FASD, and had challenges around understanding and retaining information, despite presenting as though this was not the case. The parents agreed that one of them would always be present to supervise the care of the child. After the apprehension, the child remained in need of protection and the Minister ordered that the child be placed in the grandmother's custody as a person of sufficient interest for a period of 4 months. This was a sad case as most proceedings under the Child and Family Services Act are. We have two very young parents who want to care for their child. The issue is whether they are able to provide for this child and, if so, if physical or emotional harm is likely to occur to this child. HELD: The child was placed in TK's custody for a fixed period of four months, pursuant to s. 37(1)(b). That period is of shorter duration than the six months suggested in the Minister's report. Given the parents' failure to provide adequate care for the child and the fact that the parents were not able to take the child with them, and there was no positive relationship building between the parties, it was ordered under s. 23 of the Act. The order was granted for the parents to build a positive relationship with the child so that it would continue to build upon and build upon the relationship between the parents and child."
2_2006nsfc7.txt,"Although the mother initially had sole custody of the parties' two children, they were placed in the joint custody of both parents, with primary care and control with the father, when the mother was hospitalized due to mental health disturbances. When the children were not later returned to her care, the mother brought an application to vary the primary care arrangements, alleging that the children were not receiving suitable and appropriate parenting while in the father's care. The father, who lived close to the maternal grandparents and relied upon them extensively for the care of the children, questioned the mother's emotional and mental health and stability. The transfer of primary care of the children to the mother is conditional upon the fulfillment of several provisions and prohibitions, including the mother's disclosure to her mental health caregivers of any alcohol consumption and the recent harassing phone calls made by her; should the parents be unable or unwilling to cooperate with the court directives, the court will consider filing a report of neglect under the Children and Family Services Act; primary care and access will be reviewed by the court in six months time. The children were at considerable risk if placed in the primary care of either parent; the evidence showed that the father was unable to meet the children's needs on a daily basis; in addition to his questionable parenting judgment, his regular daily drug use in circumstances where the family lived in poverty and one child had an asthmatic medical condition showed that he placed a higher priority on his relationship with marijuana than his primary responsibility as protector of his children. Although the mother's parenting plan was well-conceived, the court questioned whether she could withstand the daily pressure of raising the children and noted her past habit of consuming alcohol while taking medication.","The mother applied for a change in the primary care arrangements for two children. The father was currently employed as a roofer but was unable to drive a motor vehicle, having accumulated myriad of driving infractions to add to his already lengthy criminal record. The children were at risk of exposure to daily and troublesome drug use by the father as they were in the mother's care. Their primary caregiver was the father of three children, aged eight and seven years. He was charged with failing to provide primary care and control to the children, a charge he was facing at trial. The mother expressed her desire to remain in the physical care of the father. HELD: The Court held that the primary issue was the mother’s ability to provide day to day care for the children. Therefore, the Court found that if the mother continued to participate in the maintenance and control program, this would automatically divert funds available to adequately provide amenities for their children. As the father was not seeking primary care or control, and the mother was likely to continue to smoke drugs and be in a high-risk relationship with the father, the family would be at grave risk of loss of income, health and stability if the children were placed in primary care. The Court also held that it would be preferable to have the children placed in the sole custody of the mother, rather than relying on the father to provide daily care and support. As neither the mother nor the father were willing or able to meet the onus of providing day-to-day care and day-care, it was difficult for the mother to withstand the daily pressure of raising two active boys, especially when this was coupled with the ongoing strain of poor relations with thefather. The parents’ common-law partner was also at issue, as was the fact that the father had recently been convicted of criminal charges and was awaiting sentencing. Regarding the custody issue, the father argued that primary care should be maintained, but with a change of primary care provision, the children would be in the permanent care of their mother. This would include moving the children to a new school or living with a new friend. The issue was, could the mother afford to move the children so that they could spend more time with their mother? The Court was concerned that the mother would be placing the children at a greater risk of physical harm if the father continued to smoke marijuana and/or be in an intimate relationship with her, while the father would likely continue to have an adverse effect on their short term care and ability to support himself financially"

A judgment was rendered, dividing the matrimonial property and dismissing the appellant's claim for maintenance. The appellant now appeals on the ground that the trial should not have proceeded without him. HELD: The appeal is dismissed. 1) There is no error in the decision of the trial judge. The medical evidence did not indicate any inability to either instruct counsel or to represent him in Court. The trial judge had little choice but to do what she did. 2) The authorities cited by the appellant have no application to this case as they all deal with situations where someone did not appear at his trial. In this case, the appellant appeared but refused to participate. For the same reason, Queen's Bench Rule 271 has no application.","The appellant appeared for his trial in matrimonial matter after a peremptory adjournment. He refused to participate in the proceedings and the judge ordered that the trial proceed without him, although the judge did allow a friend to give evidence on his behalf. The trial judge dismissed the appellant's claim for maintenance. The appellant had been warned in writing that his health would be put into jeopardy by his attendance at trial. He had been given several accommodations by the court, including a provision of written instructions on the conduct of trial by self-represented litigants, time for consultations and preparation during the trial, and private room for consultation. The judge allowed the appellant to return to the courtroom after advising him that the appellant wanted to appear on behalf of the appellant. The court granted divorce, divided the matrimony property and dismissed the applicant's maintenance claim. HELD: The appeal was dismissed. 1)No error in the decision of the trial judge. The medical opinions fell far short of justifying anything other than allowing someone else to represent the appellant, but the appellant had already demonstrated an inability to obtain the services of a lawyer acceptable to him and the appellant declined to proceed with Mr. Hawke at his side.  2)The court had no choice but to do exactly what she did. The authorities cited in his factum had no application to this case as they deal with situations where a person does not appear at his trial. In this case the appellant appeared, but refused to refuse to participate.  3)The appellant now appeals the decision on the ground the trial should not have proceeded in his absence."
b_2002nsca30.txt,"A fifteen year old died in a motor vehicle accident. The estate brought a claim for loss of future income and lost earning capacity. The Chambers judge found that such a claim was not available and the estate appealed. Appeal dismissed; the context of the legislation, its purpose and text all support the conclusion that the deceased's loss of prospective earnings is not an actual pecuniary loss to the estate.","Where a person is killed due to the fault of another, the person's estate may sue the wrongdoer for certain damages which have resulted in an actual pecuniary loss to the estate. The main question to be decided in this case is whether the earnings which the deceased would have likely have earned had he not been killed are 'an actual peculiary loss' and are therefore recoverable by the estate in an action against the Wrongdoer. HELD: Appeal dismissed. 1) There has been no trial in Nova Scotia. The facts before the court are those agreed to by the parties for the limited purpose of resolving preliminary point of law. The only question on this appeal is one of law, namely, whether, if Mr. McDonald was at fault, the deceased's estate would be entitled to claim damages for Paul's lost earning capacity. Where a person dies as a result of another's negligence, the fatal injuries action is not likely to provide much in the way of compensation for the surviving family members. Generally no one would have reasonable expectation of receiving significant financial support from the child. Thus, the appellants rely on allegedly wrongful acts of the respondent for which the respondent could have sued had he been injured rather than killed. The proper remedy is for the estate to recover its lost earnings. 2) The survival of actions legislation contained several exclusions and limitations not found in the earlier Ontario and English legislation. The provision in s. 1(1) of the Fatal Injuries Act excluded causes of action for adultery and inducing spouse to leave or remain apart from his or her spouse.  3) In this case, the Court must determine the meaning of legislation in its total context, having regard to the purpose of the legislation, the consequences of proposed interpretations, the presumptions and special rules of interpretation, as well as admissible external aids."

2_2007nsca122.txt,"Two days after the wife commenced a divorce action in Nova Scotia, the husband commenced one in Texas. He successfully applied to have the wife's divorce petition set aside on the grounds that she had not been ordinarily resident in Nova Scotia for at least one year immediately prior to the commencement of the proceeding. The wife applied for a stay of execution pending her appeal of this decision. She argued irreparable harm to herself and the parties' child on the basis that if the stay was refused, she would be required to travel to take part in the Texas proceeding, leaving her law practice for an extended time and uprooting the child who was settled in school here. She also feared that she would be found in contempt for failing to obey the Texas custody orders and be imprisoned. Application for stay pending appeal dismissed; the irreparable harm claimed by the appellant was entirely speculative at this point as if the Texas court did grant custody to the father, under the Child Abduction Act, a Nova Scotia court would have jurisdiction to determine the child's habitual residence and whether the appellant was wrongfully detaining him here. Given that the Texas court would be free to continue its proceeding even if a stay was granted, until such time as the conflict of laws issue was resolved, it would be risky for the appellant not to participate in the process there. Furthermore, the order under appeal was not one that lent itself to being stayed under Rule 62.20.","The appellant appeals from a stay of execution of an order setting aside her petition for divorce. On an application by the respondent to set aside the divorce petition on the basis that Nova Scotia lacked jurisdiction, the Supreme Court judge determined that the appellant had not been ordinarily resident in Nova Scotia for at least 1 year prior to the filing of the petition, as required by s.3 of the Divorce Act. The order sets out the history of the relationship between the parties and makes several findings of fact respecting the residence of the appellant during the marriage and for the year prior before the commencement of the divorce proceedings. As well an order releasing the respondent's interest in the Nova Scotia matrimonial property. HELD: The application for a stay pending appeal is dismissed. 1) Rule 62.15 has no application in this case because the decision of the respondent was merely declaratory and does not call for or contemplate any consequential relief or require the taking of any further steps to enforce his declaration. There simply are no 'proceedings under the order appealed from' to be stayed. 2) There is no comprehensive definition of 'exceptional circumstances' for Fulton's secondary test. It applies only when required in the interests of justice and it is exceptional in the sense that it permits the court to avoid an injustice in circumstances which escape the attention of the primary test. There are no proceedings that follow from the judgment of Campbell, J. which could be the subject of this application."

Neither met the 50% threshold of ss.173(1)(a) of the Bankruptcy and Insolvency Act and each likely committed one or more acts of bankruptcy under ss.(b) to (m). However there was no suggestion of dishonesty. The combined medical earnings in the four years prior to the bankruptcy averaged $18,000 per month and the after-tax family income averaged $10,200 per month. HELD: A consent judgment under ss.172(2)(c) was ordered such that if each doctor consented to the payment of $45,000 to be paid at a rate of $1,250.00 per month for 36 months without interest there would be an absolute discharge. 1)The payments proposed by Revenue Canada of $3,349.00 per month were unreasonably high in all the circumstances. 2)Their contributions to the community did not relieve either doctor from making reasonable payments to the trustee as a condition of their discharge from the bankruptcy.","The bankrupt and the bankrupt were both practicing medicine together in Wolseley and both had filed in bankruptcy in 1995. Both doctors were required to apply to the trustee under s. 173(1)(a) of the Bankruptcy and Insolvency Act and it was possible that they had committed one or more of the sins outlined in s. (b) to (m) but there had been no knowing dishonesty on the part of either of them. The bankrupt received an absolute discharge. The trustee was ordered to apply for the unsecured claims. In the bankrupt's case the trustee ordered combined payments of $3,349 per month for a total of 36 months. Based on Revenue Canada's Superintendents Guideline of Payments (which the trustee took into account along with all other factors), their monthly family income after-tax and reasonable living expenses should leave $4,349 for the benefit of creditors. 2)If the bankrupt consented to judgment there would be ajudgment in favour of the trustee in the amount of $45,000 which would be entirely the Revenue Canada claim. The judgment was not enforced so long as the bankrupt pays the sum of $1,250 per month on the first day of each month as directed by s. 172(2)(c) as amended by S.C. 1992, c. 27(the Act) and the trustee applies the said payments firstly in payment of its reasonable fees and distribute the balance from time to time pro rata amongst the creditors. 3)The consent judgment option was most appropriate, both for the doctors and the community they serve."

2_2007nssc40.txt,"Following the collapse of the roofs of two buildings in Newfoundland, both of which were constructed with open web steel joists fabricated by the same company, the Nova Scotia government wrote to owners of buildings containing these joists, including the plaintiff mall owner, recommending that the joists be inspected by a qualified professional engineer. An inspection of the mall roof revealed that 10.5 per cent of the joists inspected had at least one panel point with a broken or missing weld and the same remediation scheme as that implemented by the Province for the government's own buildings was recommended. The plaintiff, concerned with safety issues arising from the report, followed the consultant's recommendations and undertook remediation of the mall and then claimed against the defendant, which was the parent company of the corporate entity which had fabricated the joists. The defendant's expert took the position that although the actual repairs to the welding and webs of the open steel joists was necessary, the reinforcing of the joists undertaken in the remediation was not required in order to mitigate the danger. Judgment for the plaintiff; there were defects in the open web steel joists at the mall which constituted a real and substantial danger to the occupants; this danger was caused by the defendant's negligence and the remediation program carried out at the mall was necessary to alleviate the real and substantial danger. There were internal problems with the welds which could not be discovered by non-destructive inspection and the lack of proper welding procedures and quality control issues at the company prevented one from having confidence in any welds fabricated by them, at least based on external observations.","The plaintiff obtained a number of open web steel joists from the respondent. The majority were found to have one or more bent web members or to be missing welds. The failure rate was 8.3%. The defendant, seeking reimbursement for the inspection and remediation costs, claimed the respondent was a division of the respondent and did not have proper training in the areas of quality control and safety. The respondent admitted that he fabricated the open web joists for the Mayflower Mall. The issue was whether the defects were real or substantial. HELD: The court found that the respondent had failed to meet the required quality control program and that the remediation efforts undertaken by the respondent were not sufficient to alleviate the danger. As the respondent failed to address the issue of whether the joists were subject to the mandatory minimum of inspection, it would be unfair and unconscionably negligent to require the respondent to perform such inspections on all future joists. The court awarded the respondent general obligation obligation obligation of $15,000.00 per joist."

Tuckey is authority for interpreting the word 'election' in s19 to mean both the completion of voting, but the completion thereof. The legislation allows for a recount when the first vote has been a tie. However, the time does not commence to run until that returning officer's recount is completed.

9_2012skqb99.txt,"FIAT: The plaintiff sought orders pursuant to Rule 173(a) and (e)of the Queen's Bench Rules and the Court's inherent jurisdiction to strike the entire statements of defence as they failed to disclose reasonable defences; the claims asserted on statements of defence should be advanced in separate actions; and the statements of defence were abuse of the Court's process. HELD: The applications were dismissed with each defendant to recover separate costs on the appropriate tariff. Although the defendants' pleading may delay but not defeat or prevent the plaintiff from proceeding with its foreclosure action, the defences were so closely connected with the plaintiff's demands that it would be manifestly unjust for the plaintiff to proceed without taking the defendant's defences into consideration.","FIAT: In early 2008, a major Saskatchewan hog producer came under creditor protection pursuant to the Companies Creditors' Arrangement Act. There may have been other sources of acquisition funding, such as National Bank of Canada. National Bank only been added as a party defendant to the foreclosure actions required by Rule 436(2A) because of National's interest in the equity of redemption (subject to the rights of National). National arranged for the appointment of a receiver. HELD: Both applications are dismissed. Although the facts and circumstances in each case are virtually identical, the complexity of them makes it appropriate that each defendant recover separate costs on the appropriate tariff. 1) The present FCC claims for foreclosure should be dismissed or the court should declare that FCC is estopped from foreclosing or taking possession of secured property until the expiration of the respective 3-year periods of barn use restriction by the doctrine of equitable estoppel.  2) National Bank's defences are so closely connected with National's that it would be manifestly unjust for FCC to proceed without taking National's defences into consideration. 3) There is no reference in the HTP conditions to mortgagees. The purpose of the mortgagee's statements of defence is to delay the FCC foreclosure actions without having to meet the more stringent requirements for injunctive relief. It follows that where an abuse of process has taken place, the intervention of the court by the stay or even dismissal of proceedings, although it should not be lightly done, may often be required by the very essence of justice to be done. Such jurisdiction should be exercised sparingly and only in very exceptional cases."

Following discovery examinations, the great niece, who was the alternative executor appointed under the will, applied to have the executor, the deceased's husband, removed on the basis that his discovery evidence raised grave concerns about his mental capacity to continue to act as executor. Application to remove the executor dismissed; there was no medical evidence submitted in support of the applicant's claim that the executor was not competent to administer the estate and although it was clear from the discovery evidence that he did not have a clear understanding of his duties as executor, given that he was the only beneficiary under the will, he was the only person whose interest was at risk if he failed to properly administer the estate.","The applicant, a niece of the testator, applied for an order removing the executor of her will. The deceased was the alternate executor. The applicant had difficulties with vision and hearing and clearly had difficulty comprehending and responding coherently to the questions asked on discovery. She claimed that her niece was the only person whose interest was at risk if he failed to properly administer the estate. The executor had no clear understanding of the proceeding or his position as executor and appeared to have a weak grasp of how they were dealt with. The niece argued that there is no basis upon which to remove the present executor if he is not capable of supervising the affairs of the estate or if he has no idea of the investments and activities of Mr. Conrod, a third party. HELD: Application dismissed. 1)The executor was the husband's husband. He was designated as the sole executor in his wife's will in December 2000. He is 99 years old. He has had hearing and hearing difficulties consistent with his age. He clearly had difficulties in dealing with his affairs. He said his wife was very secretive and possessive with respect to the bank shares. She therefore cannot be trusted. 2)The applicant's niece was not interested in the estate because she was the sole residuary beneficiary. She was not entitled to the benefit of her name. 3)Costs should be fixed in the cause. There was no medical evidence submitted that would require the applicant to show cause why the Royal Bank shares held in her and her husband's names as joint tenants should not be treated as assets in the will."

Section 7(2) indicates that whenever the legislature confers jurisdiction on the Court of Queen’s Bench, and is silent with respect to an appeal from that Court, an appeal lies from it. The Psychologists Act does not state that there is no appeal from a decision of the Court of Queen’s Bench.","This application concerns the jurisdiction of this Court to hear an appeal from a decision of the Court of Queen's Bench when the latter exercises jurisdiction under a statute that is silent as to the right to appeal to this Court. The particular issue is whether ss. 7(2) and 7(3) of The Court of Appeal Act, 2000, which is referred to in s7(2), which is used to refer to the Psychologists Act, and its predecessors, dating back to The Interpretation Act, have a silent on the question of when an appeal will not exist. HELD: The Court's application was dismissed when heard. 1) There is no need to draw distinction when the legislature has not, it would fly in the face of what we have found to be the clear legislative intent proclaimed by s8(2). Having regard for the nature of general appellate legislation, the proper meaning of s7 (2)(a) is that it creates the general jurisdiction of the court. The legislature amended The Registered Nurses Act in The Registered Nursinges Amendment Act, 1993, by granting specific right to the discipline body and to the nurses to appeal from Queen’s Bench unless an enactment “confers only a limited right of appeal” (SS 1959, 12). 2) The psychologists Act does not state that there is no appeal from here on out. It states that an appeal lies to the court from hereon out. 3) It is an exercise in clarity and clarity that confers the general rule that, unless an appeal is enacted into every legislation, it is silent. 4) In the circumstances, the Court was unable to resolve the constitutional issues that arose from the passage of this legislation. It was necessary to consider the general purpose of the Act, namely the need to obtain leave for 'interlocutory appeals', which is not relevant to the resolution of the issues in this application."

2006skqb536.txt,"The primary issue is whether the plaintiff, the owner of certain farm equipment consigned for sale at unreserved auction, has indirectly allowed another individual to bid on its behalf, or for its own benefit. The plaintiff corporation agreed to sell its entire inventory of farm equipment at unreserved auction for a guaranteed return of $577,500. The guarantee was given by the defendant corporate auctioneers (Ritchie). The auction was to be conducted by the defendant corporate auctioneers (LeBlanc), a newly formed division of Ritchie. After the auction sale was concluded, the defendant refused to pay the plaintiff the guaranteed price. The defendant declared the guarantee unenforceable under provisions of the 'Contract to Auction' and ultimately charged the plaintiff a commission of 14% on the gross proceeds. The defendant alleges that the plaintiff indirectly allowed another individual to bid on its behalf or for its own benefit. HELD: 1) Clause 3.07 of the Contract to Auction prohibits an owner from bidding directly or indirectly, and from allowing any other person to bid on his behalf. The issue here is whether the plaintiff allowed a family member to bid for the plaintiff's benefit. A family member can be a bona fide purchaser as well as anyone else, but the nature of an unreserved auction dictate that such relationships be disclosed to the public. The essence of the problem and the underlying purpose behind clause 3.07 is to protect bona fide bidders, and to ensure that there be no surreptitious bidding by another for the owner's benefit. 2) The plaintiff allowed Mr. Caruk to bid at the sale for the plaintiff's benefit. It went beyond the passive act of allowing him to bid. It actively facilitated bidding. Mr. Caruk acknowledged he had no money to buy equipment. The plaintiff lent him up to $100,000 for that express purpose. It is immaterial that the loan came from Mr. Tkachuk personally rather than from the plaintiff company he controls and directs. The plaintiff corporation benefited. It has leased all its cattle to Mr. Caruk and the equipment will be of significant value to the fulfillment of that contract. 'For the benefit of the owner' does not have to mean for the exclusive benefit of the owner. 3) The undisclosed arrangement between Mr. Tkatchuk and Mr. Caruk gave the nephew a significant advantage at auction. That advantage was magnified by the fact that he possessed insider information. He knew his uncle had a guaranteed price from Ritchie's for the equipment, because that information had been imparted to him by his uncle. All one needs to add is that Mr. Tkachuk would have profited very significantly had his arrangement with the nephew gone undiscovered. He would have secured a guaranteed price, while procuring the commercial advantages of having his cattle lease fulfilled using equipment the nephew could not otherwise have afforded to purchase. 4) In an area such as this where bona fides are of fundamental importance, and particularly where an owner has the advantage of a guaranteed price from the auctioneer, a deliberate non-disclosure of material information can have an impact every bit as significant as a deliberate and obvious misrepresentation. The plaintiff should have disclosed the arrangement with Mr. Caruk to the defendants. In not doing so, and in allowing and enabling Mr. Caruk to bid at the auction, the plaintiff breached clause 3.07.  5) The provision for a 14% commission on the gross proceeds of sale as a consequence of breach of a fundamental term of the contract is not extravagant or unconscionable and, as the defendants pointed out, they did not elect to exercise their conjunctive right in clause 4.05 to additional amounts as liquidated damages. The concluding paragraph would have entitled them, in addition to all other rights and remedies, to re-sell the property acquired by Mr. Caruk and to retain an amount equal to 20% of the proceeds realized. The provision for a 14% commission on the gross proceeds of sale does not constitute a penalty. 6) The defendants' claim solicitor and client costs pursuant to clause 4.03 of the contract. The defendants are prima facie entitled to costs on a solicitor and client basis, but in the circumstances there are issues whether they should be restricted to one set of costs, and other issues relating to appropriate quantum. The issue of costs will be assessed by this Court pursuant to Rule 565, with the defendants serving and filing a draft bill in the form required for a solicitor and client bill, an affidavit of disbursements, and written argument. The plaintiff shall have 14 days to reply. 7) The plaintiff will have a judgment against the defendants in the amount of $1,316.64 representing the power washing bill wrongfully deducted from the auction sale proceeds payable to the plaintiff. In all other respects, the plaintiff's action is dismissed with costs.","The plaintiff agreed to sell its entire inventory of farm equipment at unreserved auction. The guarantee was supplied by the defendant Ritchie Bros. Auctioneers. The auction was to be conducted by LeBlanc Auction Services. The plaintiff was first approached to become a potential customer. In the transitional period, the contractual negotiations between the plaintiff and the defendants generated two standard form agreements, a preliminary 'LeBlanc' contract dated December 2003 and a subsequent 'Ritchie Bros.' contract dated March 28 2004. Both parties refused to pay the plaintiff the guaranteed price. After the auction sale was concluded, the defendants declared its guarantee unenforceable under provisions of the Contract to Auction and charged the plaintiff a commission of 14% on the gross proceeds of sale. HELD: While a number of issues require exploration in the present case, the preeminent issue arises as between litigants well versed in auction etiquette. The case has much to do with the unique nature of 'unreserved auctions', where goods are sold to the highest bidder and the owner is precluded from affecting sale prices either by the use of reserve bids or through involvement, directly or indirectly in the bidding process.  1) There are indications the plaintiff did not feel inescapably bound to contract with the defendants at that point in time. While the defendants had seemingly achieved their major objectives the plaintiff, guaranteed price for his equipment, and a sale in their competitor's backyard all of them were apparently too busy to attend to details of the auction. 2) The plaintiff's alleged failure to refurbish equipment and to adequately prepare the auction site in advance of the sale could be considered by the defendants as breach of contract. 3) In the initial discussions with the plaintiff prior to the auction, the defendant attended the plaintiff's farm without forewarning, removed the plaintiff from her farm without warning, and delivered it to the buyer who had paid the balance of the purchase price to the plaintiff directly. The defendant's justification for proceeding in that fashion is that the plaintiff had actually been paid in full, in that Ritchie's had included the full sale price of the combine when it calculated the gross sales of sale, less 14% commission under clause 4.05. 4) Lorne Campbell said he did try, repeatedly, to contact the plaintiff but he was told that it was the plaintiff who would bear responsibility for any errors or omissions in description. There was in fact an error in the year, and the number of hours of operation in the description was out by about 200 hours or more"
7_1997canlii11172.txt,"An application pursuant to s232(4)(c) of the Income Tax Act for a determination of whether the applicants have solicitor-client privilege in respect of 25 documents for which Revenue Canada had sought disclosure. The applicants were husband and wife, their two sons and the companies in which they were principal shareholders and/or directors. The documents related to three separate occasions upon which the applicants sought the advice or assistance of a lawyer in relation to proposed transactions. The documents in issue were originally in the possession of their accounting firm. At issue was the extent to which solicitor-client privilege could be asserted in relation to communications with and documents prepared by third parties. HELD: 1)The privilege claimed in relation to all of the documents relating to the legal advice sought after January 1995 was upheld. 2)The claim was not upheld for copies of a letter setting out the proposal for the 1988 transaction. One letter appeared to be advice offered by the accountants to the applicants.  3)The applicants abandoned their claim for privilege with respect to handwritten notes summarizing share value and fair market value of assets which had been prepared by the accountants other than for the purpose of obtaining legal advice. The claim of privilege was abandoned for a declaration of gift and minutes of a director's meeting in 1991. 4)It has been clearly established in case law that even though a client may look to his/her accountant rather than a solicitor for advice in relation to the law of taxation, the applicants must show the documents were protected by solicitor-client privilege and not merely accountant-client privilege. 5)Although solicitor-client privilege is defined in s232(1)(e) of the ITA, the issue had to be resolved in light of the common law test for privilege. 6)Privilege may extend to accountant communications where the accountant is acting as agent or representative of the client for the purpose of seeking legal advice from a solicitor. Recent cases appear to diverge on the question of the circumstances necessary to found the requisite relationship of agency. 7)The accountants were clearly acting as agents for the applicants for the purpose of obtaining legal advice, as was found in Susan Hosiery. They were at all times acting in a confidential capacity on behalf of and on instructions of the applicants. 8)Solicitor-client privilege extended to items of accounting information obtained for the purpose of receiving legal advice. Notes prepared by the accountant and the interoffice communications summarizing discussions with the solicitor also fell within the scope of privilege.","This was an application pursuant to s. 232(4)(c) of the Income Tax Act for the determination of whether the applicants have solicitor-client privilege in respect of 25 documents for which Revenue Canada has sought disclosure. The individual applicants were husband, wife, accountant and two adult sons who were principal shareholders and directors of the corporate applicants. The corporate applicants were corporations in which various of the individual applicants are principal shareholders or directors. The documents at issue were originally in the possession of the Melfort office of the accounting firm which acted as an office for all of the applicants. HELD: 1) The accountant was clearly acting as agent or representative of the client for the purpose of seeking, receiving, or implementing legal advice from the applicant.  2) The letter and copy of the same letter were to be given to the applicant's solicitor as well as to his or her solicitor. 3) The information contained in the documents was for the purposes of compiling a tax preparer for production to Revenue Canada.  4) There was no privileged relationship between the accountant and the applicant during the preparation of the documents. The accountant's role in relation to the subsequent communication with the applicant was clearly one of being a representative for the client's legal advice. 5) Correspondence from the applicants' solicitors to the applicants which relate directly to legal advice that was being sought by the applicants from their solicitor.  6) The central issue in this application was whether and to what extent solicitor and client privilege applies to documents prepared by third parties in this case, the clients' accountants. The privilege extends to communications to or from third parties (e.g. an accountant to a solicitor in answer to an inquiry) and, in the circumstances, the parties communicating directly to each other as part of the legal advice process. The proper forum for this kind of communication is with the client and not the accountant."
4_2016skqb160.txt,"Criminal Law – Assault with a WeaponCriminal Law – Defences – Self-defence The accused was charged with assault by threatening to use a weapon, a butcher knife, contrary to s. 267(a) of the Criminal Code. The accused was panhandling outside a store when he and one of two security officers had a verbal confrontation. The accused walked towards the security officer with a butcher knife. The security officer ran to his vehicle and the accused followed him and slashed a tire on the security officer’s vehicle. The attending officer was directed to a yard where he located the accused. A knife was also located in the yard. A videotape from the store was entered as an exhibit and played for the court. The accused was considerably smaller than either of the security officers. The accused testified that he was homeless and had a lot to drink the day of the incident. He indicated that he “blacked out” and was in front of two security officers when he came to. He said that he offered them a cigarette for being in their personal space and one of the men told him that he would punch him out. The accused indicated that he got the knife out of the bag just to show the men that he was bigger than them. He said that he did not intend to stab them. At one point the accused admitted following the security officer to his vehicle and at another point said he did not. The accused said he then tried to get away from the area but was prevented from doing so by a large black vehicle. The accused said he eventually stabbed the vehicle’s tire because it was blocking his way and he went into panic mode. The accused raised the issue of self-defence. HELD: There was no question that the Crown established the offence beyond a reasonable doubt. The court found that the accused initiated the confrontation by walking up to the security officer and getting very close to him. The court found that the Crown witness’s evidence was preferred over the accused’s where it differed, namely the slashing of the vehicle tires. The court accepted the accused’s submission that the security officer told the accused to get out of his face or he would knock him out or something to that effect. The court considered the factors set out in s. 34(2) and concluded that the force or threat faced by the accused due to the size of the security officers and the words used by one of them did not warrant the action taken by the accused. The court offered numerous reasons for the conclusion: the accused initiated the confrontation; the security guard did not touch or further go after the accused; no physical force was used against the accused; and there was no history between the accused and security officer. The accused’s actions were out of proportion to any reasonable response to any threat. The court held that the Crown established, beyond a reasonable doubt, that the facts and circumstances of the case did not give rise to the defence of self-defence. The accused was found guilty as charged.","The accused was charged with assault and threatening to use a weapon contrary to s. 267(a) of the Criminal Code. The evidence presented at trial supported the Crown's argument that the accused initiated the confrontation by walking up to him and, in very close quarters, as the accused himself testified, getting into his personal space. The defence also questioned the identification of the accused. HELD: The accused was found not guilty of the assault charge. The accused's actions were not reasonable in the circumstances and did not constitute lawful protection of himself from any use or threatened use of force by the defendant. There was no history between the individuals as contemplated by s. 34(2)(f) and (f.1) nor does ss.34(1) apply. The actions in leaving the area of confrontation and going back to his dufflebag to retrieve the knife were completely out of proportion to any reasonable response to any threat that the defendant may have perceived was made or presented by him."

He was fined $1200, with a surcharge of $120 and placed on probation for 12 months. HELD: It was not in the best interest of the appellant and not contrary to the public interest to order an absolute discharge. It was clear the appellant may appeal the finding of guilt and make the request to substitute discharge for the conviction and although such orders should be made sparingly, they should not be reserved exclusively for trivial or unintentional offences. The sole issue here is whether the trial court erred in not ordering an unconditional discharge in these circumstances. The appellant is 38 years old and was employed by Westcan Bulk Transport for a number of years and was considered good and reliable employee. He had no criminal record. The trial judge directed that he be discharged absolutely or on the conditions prescribed in a probation order.

1998canlii13596.txt,"Administrative Law - Judicial Review - Bias/Institutional BiasAdministrative Law - Medical Care Insurance - Medical Fees - Repayment - AppealProfessions and Occupations - Physicians and Surgeons - Cardiologist - Medical Fees_____ A cardiologist appealed an order made against him by the Joint Medical Professional Review Committee for repayment of  $207,821.03 in medical fees he received over a fifteen month period from the Medical Care Insurance Branch (MCIB). Alleged errors of law included improperly placing the burden of proof on the doctor; failing to take into account all relevant factors including the doctor's statistical analysis; considering it beyond his mandate to provide cost effective services in keeping patients out of the hospital; by using and relying on the knowledge of the Committee in preference to the expert evidence; the orders made concerning various medical services were not reasonably supported by the evidence. The numerous grounds of appeal also included breach of the rules of natural justice by reason of a lack of institutional independence. The application under Part 52 of the Rules of Court for a judicial review was brought to determine whether there was a reasonable apprehension of bias raised by the statutory roles of the Committee and Director or lack of institutional impartiality of the Committee or its lack of independence from the Director or MCIB. _____ HELD: The judicial review application was dismissed. The appeal was allowed and the repayment orders were set aside except for the orders respecting surcharges. 1)Natural justice issues: A reasonable apprehension of bias or institutional bias were not proven. The Committee provided adequate written reasons for its decision. The chairman refuted the allegations that the Committee heard and relied on evidence outside the presence the appellant about which he was not advised. Neither the Director nor the Committee acted in a prosecutorial fashion. Examples included the adjournment granted when the appellant failed to attend and the concession to his request that no cardiologist be placed on the Committee. 2)Errors of law issues: The statistical evidence could be considered by the Committee as a prima facie case. It was then open for it to call on the doctor to rebut the presumed departure from an acceptable pattern of medical practice. This did not shift the overall burden of proof to the doctor nor did it require him to prove his pattern of medical practice was acceptable to the Committee. The Committee did not err in law in misconstruing its mandate or by ignoring the statistical analysis presented by the appellant whose definition of the mandate was much narrower than envisaged by the legislation. It was not agreed that the Committee is not bound to follow the rules of evidence and the proceedings were of an investigative nature. The phrase 'balance of probabilities' means 'more likely than not'. To hold otherwise would make nonsense of administrative law and would violate the rules of natural justice. The distinction between the pattern of the doctor's billings and the pattern of his medical practice was more a matter of semantics than substance. If economics were the only consideration the review process would be a useless exercise and the statistical comparative evidence would be conclusive of the issue. There was no credible evidence that the members of  the Committee misused their expertise and relied on it rather than determining the issues from the evidence presented. 3)The appellant established that for the most part the decision of the Committee was not reasonably supported by but was contrary to the evidence. The MCIB statistics were flawed as a reliable comparison tool and the appellant's adjusted statistics were more reliable even if based on estimates rather than substantiated data. The appellant's medical practice was unique in three respects. He did not have hospital privileges and  had staff and diagnostic equipment equivalent to a cardiac care unit in the hospital; he ordered more diagnostic tests and did more follow up than other cardiologists and had extended office hours. 4)The decision of the Committee was varied to quash all repayment orders except for $14,239.76. The appellant admitted that many of the surcharges had been billed because of his erroneous interpretation of the tariff.  5)Leave was granted to bring the issue of costs back for determination if necessary.","A cardiologist appeals an order made against him by the Joint Medical Professional Review Committee that he repay $207,821.03 in medical fees he received from the Medical Care Insurance Branch. The appeal is brought under s.49.21(1) of the Saskatchewan Medical Care insurance Act. HELD: 1) The Committee failed to provide adequate reasons for its decision. 2) It was beyond its jurisdiction to inquire into the competence of the director of professional review in the hearing conducted by the Committee. The Director of Professional Review raised a reasonable apprehension of bias raised by the roles of the Director and the Committee assigned to them by the Act. The Committee made errors of law by improperly placing the burden of proof on the cardiologist and in failing to take into account all relevant factors. 3) It is trite law that the rules of natural justice impose a duty to act fairly and independently of the Committee and to advise the appellant of such things. In this sense, the Committee's decision was fundamentally flawed if it considers only medicare patient costs without corresponding consideration of hospital costs. The Hospitalization Adjustment component of the order was flawed and should be varied accordingly."
5_2006nssc353.txt,"The claimant flooring dealer had supplied and installed a large amount of flooring in the defendant's new home. Although the defendant had visited the claimant's store and selected the flooring, the actual purchase was made by the defendant's contractor who did not pay the claimant and had now declared bankruptcy. The adjudicator found that although the three criteria for an unjust enrichment claim had been met, there was no special relationship between the parties and thus, denied the claim. The claimant appealed. Appeal allowed; the absence of a special relationship will not automatically defeat a claim of unjust enrichment; the Small Claims Court has the equitable jurisdiction to determine unjust enrichment claims.","During the construction of Dr. Paul Joseph's home by the respondent company, which contracted for flooring material from the appellant company, Jollymore contracted for the material as well as the services of subcontractors. There was no direct contact between the Appellant and the wife, and the purchasing of all the material was left up to Jollymore who dealt with the flooring manager. The goods were invoiced to Maritime and delivered to the respondent's home. During the construction process, it became apparent that some of the subcontractors were not paid by Jollymore or Maritime and the plaintiff did not receive satisfactory explanation from Jollymore as to where the money went. The flooring remained in the applicant's home and the application for compensation was allowed. There is no special relationship between the parties, frequently contractual at the outset, which would have made it unjust for the defendant to retain the benefit conferred on him by the plaintiff benefit, be it formally or clandestinely. This relationship in turn is usually, but not always, marked by two characteristics, firstly, knowledge of the benefit on the part of the defendant, and secondly, either an express or implied request by the defendant for the benefit, or acquiescence in its performance. The same is not true in almost all of the cases, cited here by counsel in which the plaintiffs have succeeded. The defendant was unaware that the work had been performed, and so it was held that no special bond existed. The small claims court has the equitable jurisdiction to determine unjust enrichment. The adoption of such a view would mark a significant retreat from established principles of restitutionary liability."
8_2005skca120.txt,"The deceased made a Will appointing her only son, the appellant, as executor. In her Will, she left her home to her son, and divided the rest and residue between her two daughters, the respondents. The deceased transferred title to her house to the names of herself and the appellant jointly. She also transferred some bank deposits totalling approximately $57,000 into the joint names of herself and the appellant and designated him as the person entitled to receive payments under a RRIF totalling approximately $29,000. After her death, the appellant took the position that the bank deposits and the proceeds of the RRIF did not pass under the Will but were given to him for the benefit of the deceased's grandchildren and himself. He paid out about $45,000 to the grandchildren and himself, but nothing to his sisters, the residuary beneficiaries under the Will. The sisters brought action against him, claiming the funds were part of the residue of the estate and obtained a judgment to that effect against him. He appeals against that judgment. HELD: Appeal dismissed with costs.  1) Section 75 of The Queen's Bench Act does not apply to this case. 2) The trial judge carefully reviewed the evidence and the law respecting the presumption of advancement and the presumption of resulting trust. The judge did not mention the possibility of and express trust in favour of the grandchildren. She must have considered whether an express trust existed because that was exactly what the appellant's evidence suggested and exactly what the trial judge rejected in her findings of fact. Since the funds in question were not given to the appellant as a gift, and were not given to him in trust for the grandchildren, they must of necessity revert to the estate. In the case of the bank deposits, the funds would revert to the estate on the basis of a resulting trust. In the case of the RRIF, the funds would revert to the estate on a different basis. Since there was no gift to the appellant, and no trust in favour of the grandchildren, the monies must revert to the estate. 3) While the appellant characterized this issue as being one of mixed law and fact, it was essentially one of fact alone, the issue was what the deceased intended when she transferred the bank deposits and designated the payee of the RRIF. The standard of review in respect of such an issue is palpable and overriding error. The judge made no such error.  4) The appellant asked for relief pursuant to s. 57 of The Trustee Act in respect of the money paid by him to the grandchildren. The appellant says he paid the monies to the grandchildren in the honest belief that he was carrying out the wishes of the deceased. The appellant knew from the outset that his sisters disagreed with his position and intended to take proceedings against him. The appellant's actions in distributing the funds without at least getting directions from the Court were imprudent for a trustee. The circumstances do not justify, on any equitable basis, compelling the innocent respondents to bear the loss to them occasioned by the trustee's imprudence","Respondents: When the respondent mother died in 1999, the appellant took the position that the bank deposits and the proceeds of the RRIF did not pass under the will but were given to him for the benefit of her grandchildren and great-grandchildren. The appellant paid about $45,000 to his sisters as well as obtained a judgment to that effect as well a judgment against the appellant for the amounts they, as the residuary beneficiaries, should have received. This appeal was against that judgment. The standard of review in respect of such an issue is palpable and overriding error and the judge made no such error. There is nothing more than the lack of consideration and the fact that the appellant knew from the outset that the respondents disagreed with the position taken by him and intended to take proceedings against him, which he did not do."

2_2007nssc235.txt,"The parties, divorced, had children, aged 23, 19, and 14 years, respectively. The wife applied to vary the Corollary Relief Judgment (CRJ) following the termination of spousal support. The termination had occurred pursuant to the terms of the CRJ which provided that support would terminate either twelve months after her graduation from the M.B.A. program in which she was enrolled, six months after she withdrew from the program, or when she found employment. The wife had graduated from the program later than expected and a further six months after her course work was completed. Both parties applied to vary child support. The oldest child had completed his first university degree and was currently attending law school. Pursuant to the father's employment, until the completion of their first degree, the children qualified for a program which reimbursed the father for 75 per cent of the child's educational expenses. The CRJ had provided that the father's responsibility to pay all of the oldest child's educational expenses was conditional upon compliance and eligibility for the education reimbursement policies. The middle child was attending university and lived in the wife's home over the summer months. Spousal support application denied; given the family history of an emphasis on education and the oldest child's career plans and apparent aptitudes, he remained a child of the marriage; the father is to pay $10,000 per year directly to the oldest child for the next two years. The father will pay 25 per cent of the core university costs which are not covered by the plan for the middle child as well as the difference in the Table amount of support for two children versus one child; the father shall pay the Table amount of support for one child to the wife for the youngest child as well as that child's expenses for private school; the wife will be responsible for any extra-curricular activities or tutoring outside the private school; the youngest child will be entitled to the same post-secondary benefits in the same fashion as the two older children; the CRJ is amended to provide that the two oldest children are in the joint care of their parents and will not include any other reference to custody or access; the husband is entitled to specified block access with the youngest child; if flight arrangements are made for this child and she does not fly (and there is no medical reason confirmed in writing by a doctor for that failure), the husband's block access shall be expanded for one week at the next access period and the cost of any penalty from the missed flight will be deducted dollar for dollar from the child support payable by the husband.","The parties brought a number of variation applications under the Divorce Act. They each brought a variation application under the Corollary Relief Judgment, which provided that the husband would pay child support of $3,350 per month until the wife graduated from the M.B.A. program, which was established when each of the children were born. The requirement for the husband to pay William's educational expenses was conditional upon the wife having finished her course work in December 2005 (six months before the spousal support order ended) and having him available for employment within months of that order. In addition, any reimbursement due from the father's employer as result of the payment of William's education expenses shall be retained by the husband. The application to vary child support was dismissed. The parties made a series of cross-applications concerning child support. The oldest child, who was 23 at the time of the order, did not graduate until October 2006. Ignoring the fall of 2005 (when she took but one course), there seems to be no reason for her not to be employed or actively seeking employment since she is in the custody of the mother."
8_2013skqb403.txt,"HELD: The application was dismissed. With respect to the issues, the Court found: 1) that the board had not relied upon the clause in the Policy Statement but on the evidence before it. It was not necessary to decide then whether the Policy Statement was ultra vires; 2) that the board’s interpretation that the Act granted discretion to the board to refuse to reimburse a specific medical treatment was reasonable; 3) that the board’s conclusion was reasonable. The scientific studies did not definitively stated that medical marijuana was effective. In some situations where a patient’s only recourse would to be to use a non-clinically approved drug whose safety and efficacy was still questioned, a determination that the medical aid was not necessary or required might be unreasonable, but not in this case where the applicant declined to try Sativex; and 4) that there was no evidence that the board based its decision on irrelevant considerations such as the potential political ramifications of paying for medical marijuana.","HELD: The application was dismissed. The Board's decision to deny reimbursement was reasonable and within the range of possible, acceptable outcomes. There was no evidence that the Board erred in determining that medical marijuana was not necessary or required in all cases. On the face of its reasons, the Board denied reimbursement specifically because medical marijuana is potentially unsafe and unproven. The board's interpretation that the Act granted the Board discretion to refuse to reimburse a specific medical treatment is reasonable. Even if Policy Statement is ultra vires, it does not decide this matter. It is not necessary to decide whether Policy Statement 5 is ultra-vires. 1) Based on the wording of the Act and the context of the relevant provisions, the Court was of the view that the board’s interpretation that it could rely on policy statement 5 or even mention it in its decision, but based its decision on the evidence before it, there is no improper purpose.  2) The Board found that it had the power to create POL 10/2011 as an exercise of the exclusive jurisdiction granted to it under s. 22(1)of the Act. It did not misinterpret or misconstrue the results of the studies. Many studies noted side effects and most recommended further research before drawing a definitive conclusion on the use of medical marijuana as medicine. However, even if policy statement was ultra- vires the Board did not rely on it in reaching its decision. It was within range of reasonable outcomes supported by the evidence. 3) Even if the Board had authority to refuse reimbursement for medical marijuana in such a situation, it did not need to decide that it is a controversial moral issue. It could not collaterally deny reimbursement where there was a perceived lack of scientific approval. Medical marijuana is not proven or required for the purposes of s. 106(1)(b) nor is it necessary for a patient to have access to medical marijuana. There is nothing in the language of that section that suggests there is a line of analysis that could reasonably lead the tribunal from the evidence to the conclusion at which it arrived at. In such a case, a determination that the medical aid is not 'necessary or necessary' or 'necessary' or required' is unreasonable but this is not the case here."
e_2009skpc9.txt,"The plaintiff claims against the defendant for water damage sustained to their belongings while in transit from Edmonton to Nipawin in a one ton, 17 foot cube van owned by the defendants. The issues are whether the plaintiffs are precluded from recovery against the defendant by virtue of the contractual term acknowledging the equipment to be water resistant only as well as the posted disclaimers to this effect. HELD: The plaintiff shall have judgment for $250 plus costs of issuing the claim and service. 1) Notwithstanding that the plaintiff signed the rental contract acknowledging that the equipment was not waterproof and only water resistant, it appears from the last three sentences of the inspection report that water was entering at the corners of the door by virtue of the door not sitting flat at the corners. This defect would have permitted excess water to enter prior to being cleaned. Perfection could not be expected since it was acknowledged that the rental unit was not waterproof and some seepage may be expected even after the door had been fixed. Nonetheless, the sealing problem would have taken it beyond the acknowledgment of the unit being only water resistant. 2) The plaintiff acknowledges that the truck remained parked outside in heavy rainfall for two days and nights prior to being unloaded. This exacerbated the scope of the damage claimed since the water would have continued to seep in unabated for roughly six times as long as the trip itself took. The Court concludes that the defendant is only 20% responsible for the damages sustained to the plaintiff's possessions.","The Plaintiffs claim $6,700.77 against the Defendant for water damage sustained while in transit from Edmonton to Nipawin, Saskatchewan in a one ton, 17 foot cube van owned by the Defendant.

HELD: 1) Whether the Plaintiffs are precluded from recovery by virtue of the contractual term acknowledging the equipment to be water resistant only as and as the posted disclaimer to this affect.  2) Quantum of damages and mitigation. The defendant was found to be only 20% responsible for the damages sustained to the plaintiffs' possessions. In all the circumstances, the defendant was only 20%. Quantum of damage and mitigation were not considered. The plaintiff was awarded costs of the claim totalling $250,000.  3) Apportionment of damages. The issues were whether the plaintiffs were precluded by recovery against the defendant based on the contractual terms acknowledge the equipment was water resistant (and not waterproof) and in the applicable disclaimers. The court reviewed the various alleged breaches of the plaintiff's property and found that even if the goods were transported in heavy rain conditions as the evidence disclosed, the plaintiffs are nonetheless the authors of their own misfortune by permitting the loaded truck to sit for an additional two days after reaching their destination in steady rain prior to its unloading. 4) Whether there was any evidence of any leakage at any point prior to the loading of the truck, even after the door had been cleaned and remedied, which would have taken it beyond the acknowledgment of the unit being only water resistant."

Matychuk was sentenced to 12 years in prison but was given credit for time in custody on a 1:1 basis because the Court had not found any circumstances to justify any greater amount of credit. Matychuk’s credit was for 19 months. The sentences were based on the circumstances of the offence: a home invasion and inflicting serious bodily harm on a young victim.

The Court was bound by the express and implied factual implications of the jury’s verdict.

He informed the court that some members of our Court have allowed this to be done, others have declined. In the court's respectful view, it is not appropriate for the Court to appoint, as selling officer, the solicitor for the applicant creditor. There are obvious difficulties with conflict of interest. Who does the selling officer serve: the Court, from which his or her authority originates; or the client? The matter is of sufficient importance that the court concluded it should reduce its thoughts to a fiat and direct that it be distributed to other members of the Court.

e_2016skpc157.txt,"HELD: The court found with respect to the following issues: 1) it would not permit the defence to argue the s. 8 violation at the conclusion of the trial because it had not mentioned it in its Charter notice. The Crown disclosed the video-taped interaction between the officer and the accused to the defence at the outset and it was clearly pertinent to the issue of reasonable suspicion, but the defence failed to raise it; and 2) there were two periods of delay and the court was satisfied that the 77 minutes between arrival at the station and the taking of the second sample was satisfactorily explained. However, the court found that first period of 35 minutes between the arrest to the time of departure was not satisfactorily explained. The officer did not act expeditiously and the delay may have prejudiced the accused because when, as here, the readings are slightly above the legal limit, the tests need to be taken as soon as practicable to ensure that the accused’s blood alcohol content at the time of driving is determined accurately. The Crown was not entitled to rely on the presumption in s. 259(1)(c) of the Code.","HELD: The accused was found guilty of driving while her ability to do so was impaired contrary to s. 255(1) and s. 253(1)(a) of the Criminal Code and having consumed alcohol in such a quantity that the concentration of alcohol in her blood exceeded 80 milligrams. The accused had no difficulty walking or talking and there was no evidence of her drinking prior to the demand. The police officer essentially decided that he had the reasonable suspicion to make the demand, he came to that conclusion without taking the time to properly ascertain the indicia of impairment. Within 45 seconds of coming upon the accused, the police officer made the demand and she provided a suitable sample. This delay was not satisfactory to the accused and prejudiced her. The need to take the tests as soon as practicable is to ensure that the accused's blood alcohol content was as accurate as possible at the time of driving. This is particularly important when the readings are slightly above the legal limit."
d_2004nssf15.txt,"The parties were married for 10 years. Contrary to the wording of their separation agreement, the husband argued that they had agreed that spousal support would only be payable for one year as the wife needed extra income from a secure source in order to obtain a mortgage on a new home.

Spousal support to continue at the rate set out in the separation agreement for a period of fifteen months from the date of the decision at which time all support shall terminate, unless, prior to the termination date, the wife commences an application which results in her showing cause why spousal support should continue; the husband has complied with his obligations with respect to the provision of an automobile. The wife's financial means and needs required support, the husband had made an agreement to provide such support and the evidence did not support a conclusion that it was agreed to be for only one year. Although the wife did not establish any disadvantage from the marriage, there were disadvantages relating to its breakdown and her lifestyle deteriorated as result of the marriage ending.","The parties were married for ten years and had entered into a Separation Agreement in 2001. The husband petitioned for divorce in June 2003. The wife, who had received one-half of the proceeds of the sale of the matrimonial home, filed an Answer in September 2003. She alleged that the husband had failed to provide her with an automobile for the past year. The parties lived separate and apart for more than a year prior to the divorce. The issues were: 1) spousal support; 2) whether the husband should continue to pay it retroactive to the date he ceased paying it; 3) whether his personal circumstances required such support; 4) the evidence supports a conclusion it was agreed to be only for one year.  5) The wife's financial situation clearly demonstrated her need for such support to continue. Although the husband acknowledged that he provided the wife with a mid-sized motor vehicle for her own exclusive use and ownership free and clear from any claim by the husband; and 6) that he made an agreement to provide such support for only 1 year. It was under these conditions that the wife had made an effort to purchase a new vehicle. She was employed as a waitress, which provided relatively the same income. She admitted that there may have been more hours available to her than she actually worked, but there was no evidence to substantiate them or indicate how they would prevent her from working full time. Although she acknowledged that her banker told her that she needed more monthly income to acquire the mortgage, she needed additional monthly income in the vicinity of $1,000 to require the desired financing. She also stated that she discussed her financial predicament with the husband. She believed that he had failed her. The judge ordered the husband to pay $1k,000 per month indefinitely. Given the husband's age and the wife's difficulties in obtaining financing during the marriage, the court found that it would be more appropriate for the wife to discontinue the support she had made in the first year of the marriage and for her to continue it for another year."

The court found the following with respect to each issue: 1) it would substitute Postmedia as a defendant pursuant to Queen’s Bench rule 3-84(2) as it was the successor to Canwest and was aware of the plaintiff’s claim when it purchased the Star Phoenix and it would not be prejudiced. It would not deprive Postmedia of a defence under s. 5 of The Limitations Act because the articles remained on Postmedia’s websites and were republished whenever they were viewed or downloaded; 2) after reviewing each of the articles and assessing the words complained of, it found that the words constituted defamation; 3) all of the defendants were found to be joint tortfeasors with Purdy because they participated in the publication of a libel and were jointly and severally liable in defamation to the plaintiff; and 3) an appropriate award for general damages was $50,000. The court allowed the claim for aggravated damages as the defendants were found to be motivated by actual or express malice because Purdy did not simply report the jury’s verdict in her articles but indicated that she believed that the jury had not reached the proper verdict in the trial. She deliberately chose to report the stories of people who had made complaints about the surgical care provided to them by the plaintiff without verifying it or seeking comment from the plaintiff. As she was acting in the course of her employment, Purdy’s malice was attributed to all the defendants. The plaintiff was awarded $50,000 in aggravated damages.","HELD: The plaintiff was found not liable. The court found that the defendants, acting alone or in concert, published defamatory comments about the plaintiff in a series of articles published on newspapers and websites. The plaintiff did not file any complaints with the hospital or any of the defendants until the very last day of her trial, which was at which point she went into cardiac arrest and had to be amputated. The articles caused irreparable damage to the plaintiff’s reputation and it was hoped that further litigation would result in an injunction requiring the defendants to remove certain content from websites under their control. The defendants opposed this request on the basis that the two-year limitation period set forth in The Limitations Act in force at the time of the alleged defamation had expired and there was no evidentiary basis upon which could conclude that no party would suffer actual prejudice as result of the requested amendment."
e_2014skqb344.txt,"The court gave leave to counsel for the plaintiff to file an amended draft order nisi. It made the following recommendations regarding the draft order: 1) the sale should be held under the direction of a solicitor other than the plaintiff’s solicitor; 2) that relying upon a partial appraisal and in the absence of information on the condition of the property, setting the reserve bid at $100,000 might not reflect the best price. Fairness demanded the reserve bid be set at $125,000 but the court set the bid at $115,000. If the property could not be sold at that price, the plaintiff was given leave to apply to the court for a lower reserve bid; and 3) Queen’s Bench rule 10-47(2) required that purchase monies are to be paid into court to the credit of the cause to be applied as directed by the court, including costs. Only after an application and service upon the defendant and after the court had assessed solicitor client costs could monies be disbursed to the plaintiff. Monies owed under the mortgage must be set out by the court on application. All of these matters may be addressed in one final proceeding, in the application to confirm the sale, if the judicial sale proved successful.","The plaintiff applied for an order nisi for judicial sale of the property owned by the defendants. The Limitation of Civil Rights Act does not preclude the plaintiff from suing on the covenant because this is not a purchase-money mortgage. However, judicial sale is required so that the plaintiff may apply to have the amount of deficiency in the judgment set by the court. Otherwise, as provided by s. of the LCRA, foreclosure of the mortgage operates as full satisfaction of that debt. HELD: The application to confirm the sale must be brought by notice of application. The draft order sets out the proposal for disbursing the purchase monies. The proposed selling officer ought not to be the plaintiff's own counsel. 1) Rule 10-47(2) and the corresponding form 10-45A make it clear that the purchase funds are to be paid into court to the credit of the cause to be applied as directed by the Court and in the event that the land cannot be sold at that amount, the plaintiff has leave to return the matter to court to seek a lower reserve bid, based upon evidence to support its position. 2) There are obvious difficulties with conflict of interest. Who does the selling officer serve: the court, from which his or her authority originates; or the client? 3) In this proposed order the plaintiff is paying itself costs it may be entitled to under the mortgage and paying itself the costs on solicitor client basis 'to be taxed'. 4) It would be more fair to set the reserve bid at an amount closer to $125,000 than to set it at $100,000. Given that the only information before the court as to the value of the mortgaged land is from a partial appraisal and with no information on the condition of the premises, setting a reserve bid may not reflect the best possible price that can be attained. It is appropriate that assess solicitor-client costs."

The creditor objected that the applicant had plenty of opportunity over the years to pay and drew attention to prior allegations of mismanagement or redirection of funds which should have been allocated to the payment of interest. HELD: The payment which should have been paid in November was to be paid within 7 days. The remaining payments set out in the schedule will commence January 2001 with the change in rate of interest from that provided under the Interest Act to one equivalent to pre-judgment interest. A 5 day grace period was allowed after which the respondent was allowed to proceed immediately with enforcement by execution, garnishment or any means it deems appropriate.

8_2014skqb299.txt,"HELD: The application was dismissed. The court held that the standard of review of the arbitrator’s decision was one of reasonableness. Section 25 of The Trade Union Act states that the conclusions of arbitrators are final and therefore the court noted they should not be interfered with lightly. Further, the court noted that the decision of the arbitrator was not of significant importance to the general public. The court reviewed the history of collective bargaining at the university and found that tenure was not dependent on the president’s personal recommendation in the past. The court found that the arbitrator’s reasoning was transparent and intelligible throughout. To include the word tenure in the definition of appointment or promotion was not the only conclusion that could be drawn. The arbitrator’s decision was within the range of acceptable conclusions and was reasonable.","The parties disagreed on the standard of review to be applied to the arbitrator's interpretation of s. 51 of the Act. The University's position was that the president's personal recommendation to the board was not required, and the Board was not obliged to follow the President's recommendation. The Arbitrator erred in misinterpreting portions of the University's Act, including the provisions of the Tenure Appeal Committee and the power of appointment 51. HELD: The arbitrator exceeded his jurisdiction, made an unreasonable decision, or committed an otherwise reviewable error. This is not a choice between Faculty decision and Presidential decision, rather it is one reached through collective bargaining. Both parties agreed to a lengthy statement of facts and the admissibility of number of documents.  1) An award of tenure is neither an appointment nor promotion as contemplated by the Act nor the collective agreement. The right to grieve a decision on tenure was only permitted under the agreement when the Board had reversed a decision of one of the committees. 2) The arbitration decision left open whether the Board's decision could be harmonized with the Agreement. The decision of the Board is final and there shall be no appeal within the University of Saskatchewan.  3) The university's position is that the grant of tenure, under the terms of the Agreement, is an appointment or promotion and is not restricted by the need for Presidential nomination or recommendation. Under the Saskatchewan legislation, s. 73(3)(b) contemplates that the President will establish an advisory committee for the President for transmission to the Board; its negative recommendations for renewal of probation and the University Review Committee are not required. The existence of a vestige of tenure in the Act, makes it more difficult to conclude that a president's authority should be personal and unfettered, and in my view more reasonable to conclude it is power to be exercised within parameters set by the Board, which includes collective bargaining"
9_2005skca89.txt,"This appeal arises from proceedings under The Family Property Act. The couple had lived together for several years. She sought judgment distributing their property. The property included a house in Vancouver, which he had acquired some years earlier with the financial assistance of his parents. The trial judge found that the respondent had acquired the house after the commencement of the spousal relationship and then went to hold that the petitioner was entitled to an equal share of its value with no reduction owing to the gifts or loans from his parents. The respondent appealed. HELD: Appeal allowed by the majority. Lane J.A. wrote in dissent. Majority: 1) The Vancouver property was acquired after commencement of the spousal relationship. The value of the property did not qualify for exemption under s. 23(1)(a) of the Act. There are a number of facts that merit emphasis. The respondent received $125,000 from his mother before the spousal relationship started. He still had that amount on hand when the relationship commenced. He used the money as a down payment on the purchase of the Vancouver house shortly after the relationship commenced. By establishing these facts, the respondent established the requisite conditions for the grant of an exemption of the value of the Vancouver property to the extent of the $125,000. 2) The trial judge erred in declining to take into account the loans of $100,000 the appellant received from each of his parents for the purpose of purchasing the Vancouver property. There was insufficient evidence before the trial judge to enable him to find that the mortgage debts were statute-barred and he did not make a firm finding on this point. The trial judge's finding that the respondent will not have to repay the loans was incomplete. He did not assess the loans in light of s. 21(3)(e) of the Act. On the whole of the circumstances concerning the Vancouver property and the length of the spousal relationship, there is no tenable basis for not giving effect to s. 21(3)(e) of the Act and the contributions made by the respondent's parents on his behalf to the acquisition of the property. The petitioner is entitled to share in the build up of the equity in consequence of the pay-down of the mortgage. Minority: 1) The Vancouver home ought to be distributed in accordance with s. 22 of the Act. The gift of $125,000 was made by the respondent's mother with the full knowledge that the parties were living together. In this case, the contribution by a third party on behalf of a spouse to the acquisition of family property is one of the usual factors outlined in s. 21 of the Act and it would be inequitable to exempt the gift from distribution. 2) The trial judge did not err in failing to deduct from the family property the loans given by the appellant's parents. He made a finding the loans were statute-barred. The trial judge clearly considered the legislation and his interpretation of the legislation was not challenged by the respondent. He also made the finding the loans would likely never be repaid. He simply used less than precise language.","This appeal stems from proceedings under The Family Property Act, initiated by Deborah Ruskin, a nurse, against Leith Dewar, a doctor. The two had lived together for several years. She sought judgment distributing their property or its value equally between them. The trial judge held that the parties had become'spouses' within the meaning of the Act in early June 1994 and then went to hold that the appellant was entitled to an equal share of its value with no reduction owing to the gift or loans. With that appeal, Dr. Dewar appealed. Appeal Allowed; the trial judge erred in finding that the value of the house was exempt from distribution because it was acquired after the commencement of spousal relationship, not before? Alternatively, he erred by failing to take into account the loans of $100,000 the appellant had obtained from his parents for the purpose of purchasing the house. The Court considered the equivalent of this section in Mitchell v. Mitchell, 1992 CanLII 8234 (SK CA), 41 R.F.L. (3d) 220 (Sask. C.A.)."
4_2011skpc127.txt,"The Ministry brought an application for a permanent order for the child pursuant to s. 37 of The Child and Family Services Act. The Minister apprehended the child at birth. The mother's three older children had been apprehended with two other older children placed with a person of sufficient interest and the third child was made a permanent ward of the Ministry. The Minister argued that given the extensive past history of the three older children, the Minister properly apprehended the infant and the permanency planning committee was of the opinion that there was no use putting off the inevitable permanent order for the child. The mother and the child's father had separated with the father supporting the mother having the child returned to her care and the father having access to the child. HELD: There was no basis for the initial apprehension as the child was not in need of protection. The child shall be returned to the mother who is a person who has a right of custody of the child pursuant to s. 36(3) of the Child and Family Services Act. This shall be done on a transitional basis as determined by the Ministry with the child to be completely returned to the mother within 30 days of this order. There was no evidence presented at trial regarding attempts by the Ministry to pursue any less intrusive alternatives and instead proceeded directly to the most severe position being a permanent order. The evidence did not justify the Ministry's position.","The Ministry brings an application for a permanent order for the child, T.J.E.S., born April 19, 2010, pursuant to s. 37 of The Child and Family Services Act. The biological parents, M.S. and P.K., oppose the application and submit the child should be returned to the mother. HELD: 1) The child is in need of protection. The burden is on the Ministry to establish its case on the balance of probabilities being the civil burden of proof. 2) The children have been placed into the temporary custody of the Minister, and the parents wish to have the children returned to them, they must make efforts to improve or remove the conditions or circumstances in the home which have resulted in the children being taken from the parents. 3) There have been ten witnesses at trial. Two of them were granted status as persons of sufficient interest. They were present throughout the course of this trial but declined the opportunity to take any active part in the proceedings."
1993canlii3174.txt,"This was an appeal from a decision varying the appellant's maintenance downwards. The parties had a traditional marriage, with the wife remaining at home and caring for their three children. Upon separation, they entered into a settlement agreement whereby maintenance was set al. $2000 monthly while the appellant remained in the matrimonial home. The agreement stipulated that the settlement was a full and final settlement on all corollary matters between the parties. The respondent subsequently remarried, underwent some difficult financial times and made the application which was the subject of this appeal. The appellant contended the terms of the agreement were final. Per Jones, J.A. and Chipman, J.A. (concurring for separate reasons), allowing the appeal and setting aside the lower court order, that while courts have ultimate jurisdiction in the matter of support, settlement agreements must be respected. There is no difference between an agreement which provides for long term maintenance and one that does not contain such a provision. The effect is to permanently settle the issue in both cases. To review the agreement, particularly after the lapse of a substantial period of time, could lead to grave injustices to one or both parties. Per Hallett, J.A., (dissenting), dismissing the appeal, that a settlement agreement which provides for periodic support payments indefinitely is very different than one which contains provisions for termination of support after a specified period. The causal connection test established in Pelech v. Pelech (1987), 38 D.L.R. (4th) 641, should not apply to payors of periodic support for an indefinite period. Such agreements do not have the degree of finality that was effected by the settlement agreement under consideration in the Pelech decision.","This was an appeal from a decision in Hall, L.J.S.C. reducing the appellant's support from $2,000 to $1200 per month. HELD: The appeal was allowed. 1)While there had been a radical change in the wife's circumstances, there was no link between the change in circumstances and the marriage. The appellant recognized her obligation to contribute to her own support and continued her efforts to find employment. 2)Plelech does not deprive the courts of ultimate jurisdiction in the matter of support. It is expressly agreed by the parties that this settlement constitutes a full and final settlement on all corollary matters between the parties. 3)The principles of Pelech should not be used to restrict the application and purposes of s.17 of the Divorce Act. Where a person has negotiated their own agreement, freely and on the advice of independent legal counsel, as to how their financial affairs should be settled, the Court may exercise its relieving power. 4)The appellant had established that substantial variations in the income of the husband self-employed business man could occur. Such changes in this context could not be considered radical unless they were permanent or substantially long-standing."
c_2016skqb293.txt,"HELD: The appeal was granted on the basis of the first two grounds as well as others. The court quashed the tribunal’s decision and reinstated the appellant’s hospital privileges. The court reviewed the transcript of the tribunal’s hearing and its written decision. With regard to the first two issues, it found that the tribunal had erred in law in the following ways: 1) by failing to conduct a de novo hearing as required. It did not refer to the expert opinion submitted by the appellant as new evidence at the hearing; and 2) by failing to explain its decision. It did not refer to the new evidence nor did it state how it had reconciled the conflicting expert opinion evidence offered by the appellant and the respondent. It merely accepted the evidence of the SMO’s experts.","The medical doctor appeals from decision of the Practitioner Staff Appeals Tribunal (Tribunal). The original suspension was done wrongfully and precipitously, and ultimately the Tribunal made fatal errors when dealing with this matter pursuant to statutory appeal. The s. 45 appeal to tribunal is a de novo appeal hearing and the parties agreed to proceed with that appeal without calling evidence. The evidence was comprised of slightly augmented record from the Board hearing. This position was set out in the appellant's notice of appeal to the Tribunal. The errors lead to the granting of a remedy to the appellant, that of quashing the Tribunal's decision and full reinstatement of his privileges. HELD: The Court finds that the Tribunal acted in good faith by holding critical incident review to be part of the overall quality assurance process of the Health Authority. The holding of critical incident reviews does not connote any wrongful act or omission on the part of any member of the patient care team. Rather, it is part of a collaborative process by which health authorities evaluate their delivery of care to determine if adequate standards are being met, how things could be improved, and how best to protect future patients from that risk. The SMO was suspended on an interim basis. The appellant has been suspended continuously since December 2014. Evidence before the Tribunal runs to approximately 2,000 pages. There is some utility in identifying what the Tribunal had before it for consideration of the appeal de nova it was to address. The Court notes that the entirety of the record has been reviewed by the court."
2_2007skqb378.txt,"The outstanding issue is child support, past and future. The dispute largely centered on what monies were owed from the past. Central to this was the determination of the respondent's income. HELD: 1) The respondent is a farmer. His income tax returns for the years 2004, 2005 and 2006 have been filed, but certain adjustments must be made. The purpose of the capital cost allowance is to provide money to purchase replacement equipment. However, not all of the money is needed and is not used for that purpose. It is that unused portion which should be allocated as part of the respondent's income. In this case, 40% of the allowance should be treated as income for the purpose of calculating child support. The personal portion of the utility costs should be included as part of his income, an appropriate percentage is 25%. An amount of the legal and accounting costs should be attributed to the respondent personally and added to his income, in 2004 $1,000 is added, in 2005 $5,000 is added and in 2006 $1,000 is added. The respondent has taken advantage of the optional inventory adjustment and that must be factored back into his income using the methodology set out in Tamke v. Tamke, 2001 SKQB 528. As the respondent's income has undergone serious fluctuation over the years, it is therefore appropriate that his income for calculating child support be based on the average of his income in the years 2004 and 2005. 2) The respondent will not have to pay half of the cost of Stacey joining a school trip to Europe. This is because Stacey paid half of the cost herself and because the respondent was asked to contribute at the time but refused. The petitioner knew the respondent had refused to contribute and, when she elected to pay the balance, she did so unilaterally. It would be inappropriate to compel the respondent to contribute now. 3) The school fees paid by the petitioner are not extraordinary and should be encompassed in the basis child support. The health costs in the form of orthodontic treatments are extraordinary and the parties shall contribute equally as their incomes are presently comparable. 3) On five occasions the respondent failed to attend at the agreed meeting spot with the result that the petitioner had to make the entire trip to deliver the children to the respondent so he could exercise access. She will be compensated for the actual lost wages and fuel costs that she incurred on the respondent's behalf, but not for costs she would have incurred in any event.  4) The respondent shall pay costs of $1,200.","The parties have three children, three of which are now with the respondent. The parties resided with their respective parents on alternate weeks. In 2004, the petitioner moved with the children to Alberta. In 2005, the three children moved back to the respondent's residence. This arrangement continued to the present. In 2006, the respondent paid child support of $300 per month for three years, but in 2004, he made no payment for the month of June. The petitioner now wants to be compensated for lost wages and the cost of fuel. HELD: 1) The capital cost allowance is an ordinary, and not extraordinary, expenses and would be encompassed in the basic child support. 2) The petitioner knew this and when she elected to pay the balance she did so unilaterally and on her own initiative. It would be inappropriate to now compel the respondent to contribute when he earlier expressed a contrary position. This is one further collateral matter. The respondent acknowledges that he borrowed money from the bank accounts of the children. He was able to do this because he had signed authority. It may be that he had the consent of each child, but the fact remains that such conduct is wrong and should not be repeated. 3) The respondent was awarded one-half of the amount owing by the petitioner for school fees, which were ordinary and not to be shared with the parties. 4) The fees are ordinary in their ordinary form and would not be encompassing in the standard child support calculation. The same applies to certain activities provided to the child Mandey by the respondent when he was residing with the petitioner."

It found that the accused was not capable of representing himself but that the accused had not shown that he was indigent.,"The accused was charged with possession of a controlled substance contrary to s. 5(2) of the Controlled Drugs and Substances Act. He was committed to stand trial on the noted offence of trafficking. At the preliminary hearing, the accused failed to complete any of the steps outlined in his previous order and had not made any attempt to inquire into a loan or home equity line of credit. He applied to have court appointed counsel appointed to his behalf in the event the prosecution insisted on proceeding with a trial in breach of the accused's Charter right to a fair trial. HELD: The accused is guilty as charged of possession for the purpose of trafficking and he has failed to meet the second criterion of being indigent. He has made no effort to obtain financing or make arrangements to put in place financing arrangements with counsel. The Court found that the accused is unlikely to conduct his own defence in light of the personal issues he is facing and his methamphetamine addiction. He comes before this court in the same position as he was on the earlier occasion without having attempted in any way to utilize his personal resources to obtain counsel and, therefore, it is important to provide a reasonable window of time for the accused to start to make such arrangements."
4_1996canlii5334.txt,"Following three patient suicides at the Cape Breton Regional Hospital, the hospital, in response to concerns and questions from family members, retained two psychiatrists to review the cases, the roles and responsibilities of individuals involved in the cases, patient records and hospital policies and practices. At the end of the review they were to provide a written report to the hospital's Chief Executive Officer. The hospital staff participating in the investigation and review were advised that their information would be treated as part of a 'peer review' and therefore confidential. Upon receipt of the report the hospital, as a result, refused to disclose the report to the families. An application pursuant to the Freedom of Information and Protection of Privacy Act was made by an M.L.A., who sought for the disclosure of the report and for a review of the hospital's decision to not release the report. The hospital decided to release the full report. The appellant employees appealed the decision of the hospital, claiming that they had been assured confidentiality. Allowing the appeal, that the disclosure of personal information consisting of personal recommendations or evaluations, character references, or personal evaluations by the appellants and other hospital staff are presumed under s. 20(3)(g) of the Act to be an unreasonable invasion of a third party's personal privacy. Under s. 20(1) the hospital is required to refuse to disclose this information. It necessarily follows that recommendations in the report founded upon such information is also presumed to be an unreasonable invasion of privacy and is likewise not to be disclosed. The remainder of the report is disclose able.","The appellants sought a judgment in respect to a peer review of three individuals who had committed suicide at the hands of their own hand. The decision was made against the recommendations of senior management at the hospital and contrary to assurances given to the families that they would not be receiving an external review. The authors, being physicians with privileges at the Regional Hospital, were approached by the appellants to participate in the peer review. They were assured confidentiality would be honoured. They proceeded to publish the report, which was not to be released to the public. The appellants appealed. Dismissing the appeal, that peer review is an educational tool and confidentiality should not be grounds for suspicion by family members of the deceased. Here, the physicians were to be the authors of a report intended to provide answers to questions posed by the families. The report was to be used as an internal document only, thus ensuring the confidentiality of their participation."

The Court will not send an issue to trial unless evidence is brought forth which, if accepted, would tend to negative knowledge and approval of testamentary capacity. No issue of credibility arose.","FIAT. In January 2003, one of 29 nieces and nephews of the deceased sought proof of the will of the late, great-grandfather, who was 88 at the time of his death. He had a small stroke which affected his speech temporarily few days before the will was signed. The doctor testified that in his opinion the doctor could instruct and complete last will and testament at that time. Evidence now before the Court by one of the witnesses to the will is that two and one-half years before he signed the will, he instructed a lawyer to draw a different will, which was never signed because of family pressure. That there might be some pressure to favour his family over charity is not surprising and his yielding to that pressure is consistent with family solidarity and could not be construed as undue influence. HELD: The issue was decided for trial. 1)It was not appropriate to send the issue for trial unless evidence was brought forth which, if accepted, would tend to negative knowledge and approval or testamentary capacity. 2)There was nothing out of the ordinary about the circumstances surrounding the will. The deceased had given instructions for a will in 1998 and then changed his mind. In 1998, two relatives obtained the notes of a lawyer who had received instructions for never-completed will. While the propriety of disclosure by the lawyer is a matter for another day, its admissibility and relevance was far from clear. Two and a half years prior to the signing of this will, the executors had provided uncontradicted evidence which affirms positively the testimony capacity of the lawyer, who worked with the deceased at the relevant time and for some months thereafter. Those attacking the will have not come forth with evidence which, should accepted at trial, would prejudice testamentary ability. 3)The applicant's role as gatekeeper was that of gatekeeper."

8_2017skqb53.txt,"The accused was charged with the commission of sexual assault, sexual touching in relation to a 16-year-old and possession of child pornography. The accused came to police attention via a report by the complainant. She reported that the accused was often viewing a pornographic website while in her presence. The police prepared an information to obtain a search warrant (ITO). The ITO stated that the search would provide evidence of the accused’s viewing of pornography in the presence of the complainant, bolstering the complainant’s credibility. The ITO did not reference possession of child pornography. The ITO sought only a search of the “search history on the computer”. The issued warrant authorized a search of the accused’s computer and related devices and media, as well as documents pertaining to occupancy of the home and control of computer equipment. The complainant subsequently alleged that the accused had taken photos of her in the shower. The police did not amend the ITO to include a search for photos. The police executed the search and seized, inter alia, a laptop, an iPhone and CDs. The police delivered the material to a computer forensic specialist at the RCMP and requested a complete forensic search of the computer and phone to obtain a general search of the Internet history, pictures of the complainant and messages between the complainant and the accused. The police knew that the search of pictures was not included on the search warrant. The RCMP did not review the terms of the warrant prior to completing the examination and examined the entire contents of the laptop and phone. The accused submitted that his s. 8 Charter rights had been violated by the search and applied for exclusion of evidence pursuant to s. 24(2). The application proceeded by voir dire. The evidence was apparently located on either the accused’s laptop or cell phone, but the nature of the evidence obtained was not disclosed at the voir dire. The following issues were raised: 1) What is the correct procedure to be used to challenge evidence seized pursuant to a search warrant; 2) Was the Crown able to call amplification evidence and have it considered in support of the search and seizure conducted; 3) Did the ITO set forth reasonable and probable grounds that the items sought were evidence with respect to the commission of an offence; 4) Did the ITO use boiler plate clauses; 5) Did the ITO establish reasonable and probable grounds that the items were likely to be found in the place to be searched; and 6) What was the extent of a search of a computer or computer device. | HELD: Evidence of the accused’s search history was validly obtained. Other evidence was beyond the scope of the search warrant and obtained by violation of the accused’s s. 8 rights. The court held: 1) There is a two-step inquiry to be made when real evidence is seized during a search. The first step is an inquiry into constitutionality, and the second is reached only after a constitutional infringement has been established. Both inquiries impose an onus on the person claiming infringement. The standard of proof is the balance of probabilities. Challenges to constitutionality of warranted searches may involve either or both a facial and a sub-facial attack on the authorizing warrant. The record examined on facial review is fixed: it is the ITO, not an amplified or enlarged record;  2) In attempting to enter evidence of the complainant’s allegation that the accused took pictures of her in the shower, the Crown relied on an argument that the ends justified the means. This amplification evidence sought to allege a whole new offence and area of search. It was not admitted; 3) The point of this voir dire was not to determine admissibility of evidence outside of the search warrant context. There was no requirement that evidence sought in support of allegations made be directly connected to a complainant or the actual subject matter of a complainant; 4) The ITO did not use impermissible boiler plate clauses when read in its entirety. However, it did not set forth reasonable and probable grounds that text messages were evidence with respect to the commission of an offence; 5) The ITO provided sufficient description. It was reasonable to infer that search history meant search history of the accused with respect to the websites defined in the ITO. Further argument was required on whether text messages could be included; and  6) Police are not entitled to rummage through entire contents of a device searching for other evidence. The ITO sought only the search history.","The accused applied for relief pursuant to s. 24(2) of the Charter to exclude evidence seized through the execution of a search warrant. The application proceeded by way of voir dire. The Crown called evidence to amplify the statements set forth in the Information to Obtain a Warrant to Search [ITO]. The accused disputed the facial validity of the search warrant, questioned the validity of it, and claimed his s. 8 Charter rights had been violated as a result of the seizure. HELD: The application was dismissed. 1)The scope of evidence at an amplification hearing is limited to correcting minor or technical errors in the drafting of their affidavit material or to include erroneous information in the ITO. 2)The evidence of the complainant's discussion with the accused about the accused taking photographs while he was naked and in the shower is not included on the evidence. It is unclear from the evidence given by the complainant whether any actual messages between the accused were obtained. 3)None of the accused's testimony in the original ITO was admissible in respect of whether his Charter rights were violated. 4)There was no evidence at the amplification hearing that identified any of the alleged offences or that the accused had spoken to her about them. The ITO could not be used to quantify the seriousness of the charge or to countenance subsequent validation. 5)It was not necessary to separate the evidence of prior authorization and probable grounds. The trial judge must determine whether the conditions precedent to the admissibility of the proposed evidence have been met. To allow the Crown to supplement the record with testimony of that which was in theITO forms no part of the evidence at trial unless the parties expressly agree to its incorporation. The evidence of a discussion between the complainant and the accused was sought to be entered to amplify what Cst. Howell actually swore to. 6)The accused was charged with two counts of sexual assault contrary to ss. 153(1)(a) and s. 249 of the Criminal Code of Canada. The accused argued that he had been in a position of trust or authority toward a person aged 16 years for a sexual purpose, touch, directly or indirectly, with a part of that body, or to have a sexual organ or the anal region of a person under the age of 18 contrary to s153(1(4) of Canada and that he believed that those who download child pornography tend to keep it."
e_1999skqb150.txt,"FIAT. It was held in an earlier fiat in June that the addition of the two proposed plaintiffs asserted new causes of action and amendments to the statement of claim could only be considered pursuant to an application under s.44(11) of the Queen's Bench Act. The defendant resisted the joinder of the new plaintiffs and amendments on the basis of undue delay and actual prejudice. The statement of claim alleged nuisance, and in the alternative, negligence against the City with respect to the design, construction and maintenance of the sewer system causing his basement to flood. The plaintiffs stated they only became aware of the damage to their home and possible health problems over period of time. Leave to appeal the June fiat was denied. The defendant plead limitation period defence to the amendment and argued that if the City had received notice of any ongoing problems it would have investigated and possibly taken steps to minimize any damage; that evidence had been lost; it may be too late to determine the causes. HELD: The amendments were allowed. 1)The limitation period in s.314(1) applies from the time damages were sustained, not from the date of the occurrence which led to the damage. The facts were uncertain. It was uncertain when the limitation period commenced. If the date the applicant should have discovered the additional damage was the date they received the geotechnical and structural engineering report, the amended claim was brought within the 1 year limitation period. 2)Inexcusable delay was not established. 3)It was not accepted that the defendant suffered actual prejudice. If it was prejudiced it was through its own inaction. No evidence had been lost. The basement was available for inspection. It had the benefit of the reports provided by the applicants. 4)The requirements of s.44(11) were met and judicial discretion was exercised to allow the amendments. The fact that the joint owner of the property was not included was due to inadvertence rather than any deliberate choice. It was also appropriate to join the new plaintiff. It appeared that the expanded claim alleged in the requested amendment was not apparent at the time the original claim was issued and arose out of the same occurrence. 4)Costs in the cause.","FIAT. The proposed plaintiffs applied to set aside proposed amendments to the original statement of claim and the joinder of parties to that claim on the basis of undue delay on the part of the proposed plaintiffs and actual prejudice to the defendant. HELD: The application was allowed. 1)The plaintiff was not included as a plaintiff at the original action. The fact that she was not appears to have arisen from inadvertence rather than any deliberate choice made at the time. Her joinder as a party in this situation is contemplated by the Rules (Rule 38(1)) and normally would not be contested. The material filed indicates the expanded claim alleged in the requested amendments was not apparent when the original claim was issued, and arose out of the same occurrence. No evidence has been lost. Any consultant hired by the defendant is in an equally good position to investigate as was the applicants' consultant and offer an opinion on cause and remedy.  2)The limitation period in s.314(1) applies from the time when the damages were sustained, not from the date of the occurrence which led to the damage. As there is no legal impediment to making the amendments requested, it is an appropriate exercise of judicial discretion to allow them."
e_1996canlii6831.txt,"The petitioner sought a divorce, custody, spousal and child support and an unequal division of matrimonial property. The respondent counter-petitioned for similar relief, including divorce, joint custody and an equal division of the property. HELD: 1)Sole custody was awarded to the mother with access on the same terms as contained in the interim order. Two reasons for not awarding joint custody were the obvious acrimony between the parties and the respondent's reluctance to support his children. Three weeks after his application for sale of the home was rejected, he applied for a leave of absence from his job. It was inferred that he was trying to avoid complying with the order for interim support. 2)The mother re-entered the workforce after many years' absence. She suffered an economic disadvantage from the marriage and its breakdown. 3)The car owned by the petitioner when she married was exempt property. The motorcycle was disregarded as there had not been a significant increase in value. The list prepared by the respondent was used to divide household goods, tools and equipment. 4)The respondent was to assume one-half of the bank loan and it was agreed that the pension funds should be shared equally. 5)It would be unfair and inequitable to the custodial parent to order an equal division of the matrimonial property. The petitioner was granted possession of the matrimonial home until the younger child's 18th birthday or until she vacated the property. 6)The respondent cannot avoid his responsibility of providing an adequate level of support by turning his back on well-paid employment. Spousal and child support were deducted from his share of the matrimonial home. The petitioner was given leave to return to Court after February 28, 1999 for reconsideration of child support.","The petitioner sought a divorce, custody of the children, spousal and child support and an unequal division of matrimonial property. The respondent counter-petitioned for similar relief, including a Divorce, joint custody and an equal division of Matrimonial Property. HELD: 1)The respondent was given leave to return to the Court so that child support may again be considered. 2)There was no evidence that there had been a significant increase in the petitioner's assets during the marriage as she was only 24 years old when she married Calvin. It would be unfair and inequitable to the petitioner as a custodial parent in the event of an order for joint custody. 3)The petitioner could not avoid his responsibility of providing an adequate level of support by turning his back on well-paid employment. It was not unreasonable to infer that he made up his mind to avoid complying with the order for interim support.  4)The parties had joint custody for 11 years. The single unusual circumstance was that the petitioner brought substantial assets to the marriage which were used to purchase a family home. This does not constitute an extraordinary circumstance within the meaning of s.22(1)(a). The parties' current income is reduced to $1,000 per month. 5)In any event, the parties' relationship was doomed to failure by their inability to fill the void created by the failure of the respondent to pay child support."
e_2016skpc106.txt,"HELD: The accused was found not guilty. The court found that the accused’s s. 8 Charter rights were breached. Pursuant to a Grant analysis, the court excluded the evidence obtained after the illegal entry of the accused’s home. The court found that the accused had not consented to the entry by the officer and the complainant and it was therefore a warrantless search. The officer did not have the lawful authority to enter the home on the basis of arresting the father as he was not in hot pursuit. The complainant had not obtained a warrant under s. 13.1 of The Child and Family Services Act to enter the accused’s home and therefore had no lawful authority to enter the home. There were no exigent circumstances to justify the search such as preventing the destruction of evidence as they already established that the person they sought was not in the house. The unlawful entry and search of the accused’s home was a severe breach of the accused’s Charter rights. The impact upon her was severe as the complainant gathered evidence and apprehended her children. The accused’s assault on the complainant was minor in nature and although not excusable, her offence was a reaction to a significant breach of her rights. The administration of justice was served by excluding the evidence.","The accused was charged with assault contrary to s. 266 of the Criminal Code. The complainant was a child protection worker employed by the Ministry of Social Services. She enlisted the assistance of the Moose Jaw Police Service to enter the accused's apartment to investigate whether the children were in need of protection and if necessary to apprehend those children. The accused was released on conditions of bail that included that he was to have no contact with the complainant. The defence argued that the accused was not in hot pursuit of an individual and that apprehension was justified on that date merely by reason of him having contact with Ms. Bigsky. HELD: 1) It was open to the Crown and the Ministry to establish that any contact of the children with Justin Lerat was harmful to the children and to infringe on their right to be secure against unreasonable search and seizure. The fact that the worker had directed the accused not to have any contact with her does not alter that situation. It is indicative that the officer did not believe he had authority under the criminal code to act, and that he wasn't attempting to act under the Charter.  2) The totality of the evidence was to the effect that the defence officer, who was appointed by the Minister under s. 57(b) of the Child and Family Services Act, was not exercising criminal law power and his entrance to the complainant's suite will be contrary to her section rights, unless that entrance and search is determined to be lawful under some other legal authority."
e_2009nssm47.txt,"The claimants live on property abutting the defendant Burrow's property. The defendant Renouf is Burrows' friend. As favour, Renouf attended the property while Burrows was away and cut down some trees that he was asked to cut. He went on to cut down several others that he felt were diseased/damaged. eventually realizing he had crossed the property line and cut down more than 17 of the claimants' trees. The claimants sued for the cost of replacing the trees with a comparable number of mature trees, the cost of removing the felled trees and to recoup for anticipated damage to their septic field. At issue was: 1. whether Renouf trespassed; 2. whether Burrows was liable for Renouf's actions (for 'hiring' Renouf or because they were engaged in a joint enterprise); and 3. damages. The claimants did not want Burrows helping with the tree removal, even if doing so would save money. 1. Renouf trespassed on the claimants' land and is liable for damages. That it was an honest mistake is irrelevant since trespass does not require bad faith or improper purpose. 2. Burrows is not liable. He was not Renouf's employer, nor were Renouf's actions foreseeable. It was a favour and Renouf went way beyond the scope of what he was asked to do. Burrows is not responsible for everything that flowed from their limited enterprise. The case law requires a degree of blameworthiness (a neglectful or unlawful enterprise) which creates a foreseeable risk of harm. 3. Renouf to pay the claimants: $3,750 to replace the trees with young, native trees (half the amount sought by the claimants), $2,000 for tree removal (half the quote submitted by the claimants since they refused to mitigate the damage by allowing Burrows to help). While Burrows had counterclaimed for damages arising from a confrontation between the claimants and his son, he did not seriously pursue it and it was dismissed. Costs of $1,234 awarded to the claimants (including $960.77 for disbursements). While the amount seems high, the case was large one and the counterclaim, although not seriously pursued, hung over the claimants' heads as they prepared for trial.","The plaintiff claimed that the defendant had cut down some trees on his property, by mistake. The defendant, who had worked in forestry all of his life, offered to help the plaintiff remove the trees. The plaintiff refused, saying that it was part of a joint enterprise and that he would not be able to foresee the defendant would do what he did and should not incur any legal responsibility. The issue was whether the plaintiff was jointly or vicariously responsible, as the claim against the defendant was dismissed. HELD: The plaintiff was allowed his costs in the amount of $1,234.90 in addition to the damages of $5,750. 1)The Court found that there was a degree of blameworthiness which caused liability to attach, either because the enterprise was itself unlawful or because there was neglect on the part of one of the parties which created a foreseeable risk of harm. The Court awarded damages to the plaintiff for the actions of the defendant and awarded damages against him in the amounts of $3,750 for tree replacement and $2,000 for tree removal. 2)There was no evidence that any of the defendants, including the defendant, supplied the chainsaw or the gas. 3)The plaintiff was not prepared to accept the defendant's suggestion that he was paid by the plaintiff to remove the fallen trees, thus avoiding any risk to his septic field. What value did the trees have? The claim was largely an emotional reaction to being sued, and the fact that counsel became involved in the file and cooler heads prevailed, leaving it unclear what the likely cost would be."
e_2002skpc80.txt,"The accused was charged with owning a dog that without provocation attacked a person contrary to the Urban Municipality Act s.135.3(3). There were four separate incidents involving the dog in September 2001. At issue was whether the Crown had proven an attack on any of the four occasions. The accused agreed that the presumption of non-provocation set out in s.135.2(1) of the UMA applied and that presumption had not been displaced. HELD: 1)A $200 fine was imposed along with conditions. The dog must be kept within an enclosed continuous fence and chained to a post. There must be a gate preventing exiting except while on a leash and muzzled. The owner must display a sign stating Guard Dog on Duty. 2)If dog is territorial or protective, and the facts show the human has, by intruding, been in law provocative, the offence may not be proven beyond reasonable doubt. On the evidence there was no intrusion sufficient to justify an attack or which could be considered provocation. 3)There were seven specific pieces of evidence which supported the conclusion that the owner did not take reasonable steps to ensure his dog did not attack someone in the fashion prohibited by s.135.3(3). It is irrelevant at law that after dog attacks it responds to its owner's commands. The dog escaped the yard, was off leash and was not sufficiently restrained or enclosed. logging chain affixed to post is substantial way of tethering dog. One would not expect dog to be attached to logging chain if there were no concerns.","The accused was charged with assault contrary to s. 135.3(3) of the Urban Municipalities Act. The evidence indicated that the accused's dog escaped through a garbage can enclosure in front of his house, and then ran through the backyard of his neighbour. The accused argued that he did not take reasonable steps to prevent the offence from occurring. HELD: The accused was fined $200. On the definition of attack, as understand it, the dog was not sufficiently restrained or enclosed, that it ran from its yard and attacked the lady attending a garage sale, nor was there sufficient scheme in place to prevent a small person, a small child, or the dog from getting free itself. On all of the evidence, the court found that the Crown had established beyond a reasonable doubt that there was an attack on the accused. The court also imposed a fine of $200 on the appellant."
b_2010nssc387.txt,"The small claims adjudicator granted an order for substituted service after the respondent had trouble serving the appellant with notice of her claim. As per the order, she personally served the appellant's mother and notified the appellant of the hearing date by text message. He didn't appear and default judgement was granted against the appellant in the amount of $11,031.35. The appellant appealed, arguing the adjudicator failed to follow the natural requirements of justice. He denied being in contact with his mother. He admitted receiving the text message(s) but said he didn't believe the respondent, but didn't make any further inquiries. New evidence (a letter from his mother saying she was not in contact with her son) was allowed on the appeal. Appeal dismissed. The right to be heard is a fundamental right, and an appeal of a default judgment must be subject to the highest scrutiny. Here the respondent's claim was valid. The adjudicator had the jurisdiction/authority to make an order for substituted service and the respondent followed it. At the very least, the appellant was notified of the hearing dates by text message(s). While he may not have believed the messages, he should have taken some steps to confirm with the court if there was indeed a hearing set. He failed to prove he had a reasonable excuse for defaulting, chose to ignore the notice, and was mistaken only as to what would be the outcome if he failed to appear.","The respondent appeals a decision of the Adjudicator in the amount of $10,852 plus costs of $139.35 for a total of $11,031.35. The singular ground of appeal cited in the appellant's Notice is a failure to follow the requirements of natural justice. The appellant mistakenly showed up for the hearing on the wrong date, which was one day after the actual hearing. While waiting around for half an hour, he checked the doors of the Court House several times, then assumed that Court was cancelled because of bad weather. On that hearing date, the adjudicator issued an order for Substituted Service by serving a copy of the claim on the respondent's mother and by texting to the defendant the new hearing date. This matter was reheard to give all parties an opportunity to present evidence and be heard by an adjudicator. Natural justice demands that the appellant be heard. The respondent did everything that she was directed to do by the Small Claims Court and the Court did what it was authorized to do under the Act and Regulations. Service having been properly effected on the Respondent, the Court is not prepared to interfere with this finding of the Small claims Adjudicators."
e_2012nssc101.txt,"The accused was charged with sexual assault and various other sexual offences with respect to his niece (who had spent weekends and summers with her father, who lived with his sister and the accused) when she was between the ages of 12 to 15. The accused denied the allegations, suggesting that, since the niece had not disclosed any of these matters until she was 17 years old, she had made up generalized allegation against him to stop her boyfriend from breaking up with her and then found it necessary to maintain the lie, tell her friends, her mother and the police and get more specific when pressed for details. He also argued that she was not credible because her testimony in court was inconsistent with that in the preliminary inquiry and although there were numerous persons she could have confided in at the time, she never told anybody about the alleged incidents but kept going back to visit her father. Accused found guilty of all counts. Although she was at times frustrated and unable to recall precisely, the niece's demeanour was consistent with a young person doing her best to be truthful and accurate in intimidating and embarrassing circumstances. Her evidence was both consistent with that of other witnesses and internally consistent and the inconsistencies with her previous statements were minor. The court found she had no motive to lie initially or during her trial testimony and the reality was that by making these allegations, she knew her father would be forced to move and would become estranged from his sister, her family would be fractured and the 'sister'-like relationship she had with the accused's daughter would end.","The accused was charged with four counts of sexual assault, including touching a person under the age of 14 years with a part of his body contrary to s. 271(1)(a) of the Criminal Code, and two counts of touching directly or with an object contrary to that of s. 151 of the Code. The Crown alleged that the accused and his family moved from Street to Street between 1999 and 2009, and that between May 2008 and April 2009 they both moved to Crescent, which is not far from School. Both of the accused's children considered the other's father an uncle, by marriage to the mother of the complainant, and believed that he intended the victim to receive a communication as an invitation, incitement or counseling to do the physical conduct, coupled with knowing the communication was for a sexual purpose. There was some confusion between the evidence of the witnesses about where each household might have lived and when. HELD: The accused was found guilty of both counts. The accused's evidence was not credible. The court considered the factors that would be most helpful in assessing the credibility of witnesses. 1) the attitude and demeanor of the witness were useful. 2) the principles of reasonable doubt were comprehensively addressed by the Supreme Court of Canada in v. Ewanchuk 1999 CanLII 711 (SCC), [1999] SCR 330. In this case, the accused had been in common-law relationship with the complainant. He had been living with her for some time. The complainant would have been between 10 and 15 years old at the time of the alleged offences; the accused would often invite the complainant to his residence and would often touch directly or indirectly his penis, which by words and actions was considered by the Crown to be for sexual purposes. The issue of credibility was also one factor in a lot of cases, and in this case was most important."
d_2008nsca10.txt,"The appellant appealed the adoption order regarding her natural child. Although at one time the child had been in the permanent care of the Agency, that order was terminated and replaced by a private guardianship order which had placed the child with the now-adoptive parents. Although neither of the birth parents, who resided in British Columbia, had attended the adoption hearing, the birth mother now sought access to the child and requested that the court receive fresh evidence as to her unsuccessful efforts to obtain counsel to represent her at the adoption hearing. Appeal allowed; adoption order set aside; matter remitted to the application court for a further hearing; application to admit fresh evidence granted in part; the portions of the appellant's affidavit addressing her efforts to secure counsel for the adoption hearing admitted into evidence. The appellant had a bona fide intention to appear or to be represented at the hearing and had made reasonable, although unsuccessful, efforts to do so. Allowing the appeal would be in the child's best interests as she had resided with the adoptive parents for the past three years and would continue to do so pending the further hearing.","The appellant was the birth mother of a child born in 2002. A temporary guardianship order issued in Alberta was revoked in 2005. The child was returned to her birth parents but again apprehended by the child welfare authorities. In 2005 an order for permanent guardianship was granted, which was terminated in favour of private guardianship by the respondents. The appellant sought fresh evidence on this appeal. She argued that she had a bona fide intention to appear or be represented and that she made reasonable, although unsuccessful, efforts to do so. HELD: Appeal allowed. 1) The due diligence requirement is not applicable here. The judge was entitled to dispense with the mother's consent if she did not appear at the adoption hearing. However, the appeal court would make no comment on the merits of the appellant's intended submissions to that court or in any event that the reference to access in the Private Guardianship Order is an 'access order' or 'access provision' within the meaning of s.78(6) of the Act. 2) The parties were unaware that the appellant birth mother wished to be heard. Consequently, they were denied the right to participate in the hearing."
6_2007skqb111.txt,"FIAT: A caveat registered to the applicant was removed as a result of the notice to lapse procedure. The caveat purported to be based upon a right to receive royalties from all gas, carbon and oil produced from the land. The applicant denied having ever received the notice to lapse. The applicant sought: 1) retroactive reinstatement of the caveat by order of the Court; and 2) an inquiry by the Court as to whether or not the caveat was removed improperly. The respondent companies that acquired an interest in the subject land subsequent to the caveat being removed opposed the application based, among other things, on the principle of indefeasibility of title, as did the Registrar of Land Titles. HELD: The application is dismissed with costs to the respondents. 1) Even if the caveat was removed improperly, the Court ought not to retroactively reinstate it, because to do so would defeat the fundamental principle of indefeasibility of title that has been continued in The Land Titles Act, 2000; and 2) it would not be appropriate to permit the applicants to attempt to access the assurance fund through the mechanism of a chambers application requesting declaratory relief. The process, if the applicants chose to pursue it, would be an action under Part XII of the Act.","HELD: The application was dismissed. The court found that even if the caveat was wrongfully removed by the Registrar of Land Titles, it would not be appropriate to retroactively reinstate the caveat. The companies that acquired an interest in the South West Quarter of Section Twenty-seven (27), in Township Two (2), in Range Four (4), in the Province of Saskatchewan, in the Dominion of Canada, were entitled to costs of defending the application. 1)Although the legislation that introduced the new land titles system contained transitional provisions that stipulate that any process started under the old Act is to be completed under the new Act, as far as practicable, it was not practicable to do so. 2)Even if the caveats were removed improperly, this Court ought not retroactively by order of the Court. The application is dismissed. 3)The principle of indefeasibility of title was not materially altered by the passage of the land titles act, 2000. In fact, several of the companies that were represented by one counsel claimed that they had no interest in land capable of supporting the caveat at the time it was registered on January 13, 1986. This is because this type of alleged royalty interest is not an interest capable of being protected by a caveat and, even if it was, Mr. Brick assigned his interest to his sons and therefore did not personally have an Interest in the subject land. If a claim was made, it ought to be made to the Registrar and, if denied, by commencing an action, which in this context would mean by the issuance of a statement of claim. That would entitle the parties to the action to take advantage of the procedures available to actions commenced in this Court including production of documents, examinations for discovery, pre-trial conferences and so on."
d_2005skqb454.txt,"The plaintiff sues the defendants for $50,000 plus interest. The claim is based on the allegation that the plaintiff loaned the defendant Kelly $69,000. The plaintiff claims the defendants agreed to repay the loan in the amount of $1,500 per month. HELD: The plaintiff's claim is dismissed. The only evidence that might suggest that this transaction was a loan to either of the defendants was that some of the payments made by the defendant to the plaintiff were in the amount of $1,500, the amount that the plaintiff asserts was the monthly amount to be repaid by the defendant for the loan. However, there was no evidence as to when the agreement to pay $1,500 was made. In her testimony, the plaintiff stated that when the decision was made to pay the $69,000 to the business, she did not have a discussion with the defendant, Kelly. The only discussion she seems to have had was with her husband after which she wrote a cheque to the defendant.","The plaintiff sought damages in the amount of $50,000 plus interest in accordance with the provisions of The Pre-judgment Interest Act. The claim was based on the allegation that she loaned $69,000 to the defendant. The defendant denied that the transaction was a loan, and argued that in fact it was an investment by the plaintiff and her husband into the auto brokering business. HELD: The plaintiff's claim was dismissed. 1)The evidence strongly supported the conclusion that the defendant had a loan to the plaintiff. The evidence did not support the defendant's assertion that the plaintiff had repaid the loan on a monthly basis. There was no written contract or other written evidence of any agreement between the plaintiff, the defendant, and/or the numbered company defendant evidencing the nature of the transaction. 2)There was no evidence that any of the payments made by the defendant were in excess of $1,500 per month. The plaintiff stated on cross-examination that she felt she received a profit from the first transaction, and that she categorized some payments from as 'commission' rather than a loan. 3)The only evidence that might suggest that this transaction was loan to either of the defendants was that a separate affidavit was filed with the plaintiff's counsel. No evidence was held as to whether the defendant ever made a monthly written decision on the basis of what she had stated in the affidavits filed on the business. However, there was some evidence that she did make a monthly decision to pay monthly as she did not have material to file with the company on which the monies were intended to be paid. 4)Issue No.5 was moot.

A date for the extradition hearing was set.,"The accused, a Jamaican national living in Canada, applied for a stay of proceedings pending extradition on the grounds of contempt of court for failing to provide proper disclosure and for the Attorney General to discharge under s. 29(1) of the Extradition Act. HELD: The motion on behalf of the accused was granted and the hearing was to proceed on January 6, 2004.  1)The accused was entitled to disclosure of all the evidence in his custody or control except only the diplomatic note from USA to Canada which initiated the process. There had been no investigation in Canada of the alleged offence. The Attorney General has only that information which the USA authorities have seen fit to provide to him. 2)The application was dismissed.  3)The role of the hearing judge was modest one; absent express statutory or treaty authorization, the sole purpose of an extradition hearing is to ensure that the evidence establishes a prima facie case. The extradition procedure is based upon a treaty where each state assumes that the reciprocating state has a fair and just criminal system. The applicant is entitled, at the extradition stage, to present his defence on the assumption that a fair hearing will not take place at the trial or in order to avoid trial in the foreign state. Disclosure of the information and materials applied for might assist the applicant in his attempt to persuade the Minister not to surrender him. That argument was not advanced, nor was it expedient at this stage."
c_2001skqb39.txt,"The defendants brought an application to compel responses to a large number of questions objected to at examinations for discovery of the proper officer for SPMC, and sought an order requiring SPMC to comply with numerous undertakings. The objections were categorized as the questions sought to elicit the plaintiff's manner of investigation or expert opinions; it should have been asked of another witness better suited to answer or third parties as the questions relate to issues between the defendant and the third parties; it was irrelevant or improper. HELD: 1)The plaintiffs were not required to answer questions which would require them to accept or reject an opinion of another party to the action. 2)The plaintiffs should answer what cellulose fibre insulation was present at the time of the fire. 3)The affidavit answered whether Miner was a participant in the investigation notwithstanding the defendants are not entitled to the names of possible expert witnesses at the discovery stage. 4)Any meeting between the plaintiff's investigators and the fire marshal clearly related to its investigation and is privileged. The defendants could obtain the information directly from the fire marshal. 5)The question of whether there was any liaison between the city fire investigator and SIAST was improper as it relates to the manner of investigation. Questions can be asked of the city. 6)Details of the plaintiff's investigation, including an engineer's report, was protected by litigation privilege. 7)The question regarding what observations were made of the damage was too vague. The plaintiff's claim was in excess of $7 million. A proper foundation must be laid in the context of specific questions and answers given or not given (Hill v. Arcola School Division). The defendants are not entitled to expert opinion. 8)Whether SPMC's insurer's investigation team participated related to manner of investigation and was therefore privileged. 9)The defendant will be able to examine the city in the third party claim with respect to documents from the fire department. 10)All discussions at mediation proceedings are strictly confidential. The name of the plaintiff's expert, who prepared the drawings in contemplation of litigation, is privileged. 11)The facts and observations upon which expert opinions are based must be disclosed including any photographs.  12)Whether any pattern on the wood would indicate contact by propane flame required expert opinion. 13)Questions concerning what material first ignited could only be answered by having experts reconstruct what in their opinion occurred at the time the fire started. 14)If the plaintiffs do not have a position (on whether there was a fire stop in the 1967 construction of the tower), there is no rule the court is aware of requiring them to adopt a position. They can be required to give an undertaking to provide a position if they adopt one at a later date. Whether they believed the building was built in accordance with the 1960 fire code when constructed in 1967 was information obtainable by the defendants. 15)If the party being examined had no control over or greater access to a witness than the examining party, it need only disclose the evidence known to it. There is no obligation to seek information from third parties when the defendants are capable of obtaining that information. 16)An undertaking was given to advise if and when the plaintiffs develop a position on whether the parapet roof was constructed in accordance with the detail set out in FC and whether the detail in the sketch of the Tower parapet was correct. 17)If the request for the proposal related to Kelsey, the document should be produced, but if it only related to the Regina campus, the document was not relevant. 18)Whether it was considered anytime that Hagblom would be a sub-consultant was a legal question. The trial judge will interpret the terms of the agreement. 19)Any information required could be obtained directly from the architects who had been added as third parties by the defendants.  20)The plaintiffs gave undertakings to answer the other questions and did not object to answering them. 21)The 36 objections (less 3 that were withdrawn) failed. It would be an abuse of process for the defendants to ask the same question of a second officer hoping to obtain a different answer. The same question can be put if the first did not answer it. The fact there were three separate officers does not restrict the defendants to only asking certain questions of each. The reason for having three officers, each with a different expertise in a certain area, was to prevent the plaintiffs from having to give endless undertakings. Having all three present during each examination would have saved time and unnecessary legal fees. 22)The exhibit was not before the court to determine how complicated the question was. Defence counsel was to break it down. 23)There were 200 undertakings. As a general rule examinations for discovery should be completed before the party being examined is required to comply with the undertakings. It would lead to endless delay if the examining party were allowed to simply adjourn and demand the undertakings be complied with. There were no exceptional circumstances.  24)Costs were left to the trial judge.","The defendants applied to compel responses to a large number of questions that were objected to at examinations for discovery of proper officers on behalf of Saskatchewan Property Management Corporation (SPMC). They sought an order requiring SPMC to comply with numerous undertakings. The plaintiffs had issued a statement of claim for damages in excess of $7,000,000 that alleged the application of a 'Torch on' air vapour barrier to the northeast corner of the Tower. The defendants had filed statement of defence against the City of Saskatoon, Fire Chief William Hewitt and numerous architects and engineers. In issue was whether certain documents referred to in the plaintiff's statement as to documents and for which the plaintiffs claimed privilege were obtained from the city. The wording of the question asked was too vague to answer. The plaintiff was entitled to the names of possible expert witnesses but not to reject them. Objection No. 8-P. 317, Line 15 to P. 318 was an objection to the question as it relates to the manner of the plaintiffs' investigation and is not proper. The question was also improper in that it sought to know what observations were made of the damage post fire, the damage to the roof and its occupants, the attic that would connect the point of breakout to the point where Hagblom were operating or were working, the physical characteristics of the building and the witnesses were not discoverable."
c_2012skqb426.txt,"The Crown applied under Part XXIV of the Criminal Code to have the accused declared a dangerous offender after he pled guilty to committing an aggravated assault on his common-law spouse contrary to s. 268 of the Code. The application is based on the Code provisions in effect before the danger offender legislation set forth in The Tackling Violent Crime Act was passed. The accused is 52 years old and in poor health. He has a significant criminal record thatreveals a history of violence and an inability to abide by court orders. The offences occurred between the time he was 40 and ended in 2006 with his last conviction, the predicate offence. Two psychologists prepared psychological assessments both of which concluded that the offender should not be declared a dangerous offender because his risk to re-offend could be reasonably managed by supervision in the community. The issues before the Court were: 1) whether the predicate offence is a serious personal injury offence as defined by s. 752 of the Code; 2) whether the offender is a threat of the kind contemplated by s. 753 of the Code and thus a danger to society; 3) if so, whether the Court should exercise its residual discretion an impose a fixed-term sentence or resort to long-term offender provisions, even though the statutory criteria for declaring the accused a dangerous offender have been met; and if a long-term offender designation is warranted, what determinate sentence and long-term supervision order should be imposed? HELD: 1) The Court held that the aggravated assault committed by the offender was a serious personal injury offence because it was an indictable offence involving the use of violence against his spouse. 2) The Court found that the Crown had proven the criteria required that the offender clearly fits within the definition set forth in ss. 753(1)(a)(i) and (ii), in that this offender had shown a repetitive and persistent pattern of aggressive behavior, especially against women. 3) The Court decided to exercise its residual discretion not to designate the offender as a dangerous offender and found that the he met the long-term offender criteria and that his risk to re-offend could be managed within the meaning of s. 753.1(1)(c). The offender has never been imprisoned in a penitentiary and thus had never had the benefit of programming offered in that system. The appropriate sentence should be 7 years. As the offender has spent approximately 3 years and 4 months in pre-sentence custody, the Court gave him credit in that amount on a one-to-one basis. The Court ordered that the appropriate length of time for a long term supervision order is the maximum of 10 years since the offender needs to learn alternative ways to express his frustration and address his issues with alcohol.","The offender pled guilty to committing an aggravated assault on his common-law partner contrary to s.268 of the Criminal Code. The Crown has applied under Part XXIV of the Code to have him declared a dangerous offender. The offender is 52 years old and is a 52-year-old man with a significant criminal record. HELD: The Court has jurisdiction to entertain the dangerous offender application. The application was made following the conviction of the offender and prior to him being sentenced. The Court is also in a superior court of criminal jurisdiction. 1)The offender is a high risk to re-offend violently and this risk will be mitigated only if he conscientiously applies himself to learning alternative ways of venting his frustration and anger. 2)There is no doubt that the offender fits the criteria set forth in the relevant Criminal Code provisions in force at the time. The only real issue is whether there is a reasonable possibility that he can eventually be controlled in the community so as to justify the imposition of a long term offender designation rather than the more serious dangerous offender designation.  3)There are two additional events that are also germane to the consideration of his criminal history. On January 1, 1995, the offender was charged with common assault and was sentenced to 60 days in jail. That matter was apparently resolved by having the offender enter into a recognizance wherein he was required to report to probation officer, have no contact with his wife and accept drug, alcohol and anger management programming. He has serious health problems and requires surgery to have his heart valve repaired. In 2008 he had a stroke and requires the use of a cane for stability and for walking lengthy distances. He is currently undergoing treatment for post-traumatic stress disorder. 4)His risk for violence in the future is high, which is mitigated by applying an appropriate determinate sentence."
b_2010skqb187.txt,"The plaintiff granted the defendant a mortgage over a parcel of land just outside the city limits. The defendant failed to make any payment. The plaintiff applied for foreclosure on the land and an order nisi for judicial sale. The defendant was a developer. He argued that the foreclosure action was void because the land was being used as farmland and was subject to protection under s. 9 and 11 of The Saskatchewan Farm Land Security Act. The other issues before the court were the appropriate period of redemption and whether the plaintiff could submit a bid that incorporated the value of the land as a 'credit' enabling the plaintiff to merely 'top up' the bid by the additional amount needed to reach the bid price. HELD: The Saskatchewan Farm Land Security Act (SFSA) did not apply. The undisputed evidence was that since the defendant acquired the land in 2007, their focus was to develop the land as an industrial park and they had undertaken a host of activities to achieve that purpose which clearly indicated that their intent was not to farm the land in the sense contemplated by the SFSA. There was no foundation to deviate from the usual redemption period of 90 days from the date of the decision. The bidding process in a judicial sale contemplates a level playing field for all participants. The fact that the plaintiff is likely to receive a significant cash payout from the judicial sale does not modify the desirability of obliging all bidders to pay into court the full bid price. Normal bidding rules shall apply. The plaintiff was entitled to costs.","HELD: The application was dismissed and the usual bidding rules were applied. The applicant had failed to meet the requirements set out in the Farm Land Security Act (SFSA). The land had been purchased by a developer for development and its focus had been the undertaking of a host of activities designed to develop the land into an industrial park. The purpose of the SFSA was to protect farmers against loss of farm land. The land was purchased by the developers for development, was being developed at the time this action was brought and neither at that time nor since has there been any realistic prospect of it being developed. The redemption period was 90 days from the date of this decision. The plaintiff had to pay into court the full bid price."
2_2005skqb513.txt,"FIAT: The parties are the parents of a son born April 10, 2003. They are married and the family home is in Connecticut. The respondent mother is a Canadian citizen and has returned to Canada and now resides in Laird, Saskatchewan. The petitioner is an American citizen and continues to reside in Connecticut and brings an application under The International Child Abduction Act for an order directing the child to be returned to Connecticut. HELD: The respondent is directed to return the child to the State of Connecticut by January 8, 2006.  1) The child was born in Canada. He and his mother joined his father in Connecticut one month later in May 2003. In February 2004 the child and his mother returned to Canada for a planned one-month visit. It is clear that the petitioner did not consent to the prolonged absence of the respondent and the child. In about November 2004 the respondent and the child returned to Connecticut and resumed living with the petitioner. Reconciliation was attempted. The respondent and child left in December 2004 and have not returned. The crystallizing moment was in March 2004 when the respondent did not return from her trip to Canada. For the purposes of the Convention, circumstances should be examined to determine habitual residence. At this point the parties had adopted traditional roles. The respondent was at home raising the child and the petitioner was attending his duties in the navy. Through their conduct the parties had evidenced a settled intention to make their home in Connecticut. The respondent chose to unilaterally remove the child from that home. 2) The petitioner had obtained an interim order in February 2005 directing the child to be returned to Connecticut. He also pursued his case in the Superior Court in Connecticut and on October 2005 obtained an order dissolving the marriage, directing the respondent to return the child to Connecticut and granted the petitioner sole custody. The respondent now asks that any order directing her and the child to return should be conditional on the petitioner varying the order he obtained in October 2005, vacating the award of sole custody to the petitioner and replacing it with something in the nature of joint custody. The conditional return order proposed by the respondent is inappropriate. Having determined that an order for return is warranted under the Convention, it does not lie with a Saskatchewan Court to impose a revised starting point for the process of determining custody in Connecticut. This Court's role concludes upon the determination the petitioner has made out a case for an order for return.","FIAT: The parties are the parents of a child born April 10, 2003. They were married in Connecticut and the family home was in Laird, Saskatchewan. The respondent mother, an American citizen, continues to reside in Connecticut. The petitioner father brings an application under The International Child Abduction Act for an order directing the child to be returned to Connecticut. HELD: 1) The case law is at odds as to whether reference should be had to the domestic statute when addressing the issue of habitual residency under the Convention. 2) There is no question the petitioner did not consent to the prolonged absence of the respondent and Joshua. When they did not return, the consent was implicitly withdrawn and at that point for the purposes of the Convention, the child was granted sole custody. The child is now settled into his new environment. The parties have demonstrated that they have a right to custody and therefore meet the obligation under Article 12 of The Convention. As have concluded the child's habitual residence is in Connecticut, the relief under Articles 12, 13 or 20 are applicable. 3) The petitioner obtained an interim order in February 2004 directing the respondent to return Joshua to the United States. In October 2005, the respondent obtained an order which, inter alia, granted the petitioner sole custody of the child. This decision was appealed. 4) The essence of the evidence was that the respondent had indicated that she intended to return the child forthwith and that she had purchased a return ticket. 5) The Court concluded that it was impossible to replace the respondent's intention to remove the child with her own intention to return to the child so that the child would have a permanent residence in the appropriate place. The decision was also impossible to achieve in Saskatchewan without the consent of the petitioner."

This fiat concerned several documents. The Crown had already disclosed the contents of each of these documents and the only matter remaining in issue was the name of the lawyer who released the information.

3_2001nssc117.txt,"The plaintiffs were Sergeants in the Town of Bedford Police Department. Following amalgamation and before any collective agreement was concluded, the Chief of the amalgamated force issued a department order declaring that all persons in the position of the plaintiffs would be referred to as a level two Sergeant which created a two-tier structure within the Sergeant rank. The bargaining agent for the union declined to process a grievance on behalf of the plaintiffs and agreed with the two-tiered structure which was eventually incorporated into the collective agreement. After unsuccessfully complaining to the Nova Scotia Police Commission and the Halifax Regional Board of Police Commissioners, the plaintiffs commenced an action alleging that the creation of the two-tiered structure was a violation of the Police Act and adversely affected their employment rights. The intervenor union brought an application to strike the plaintiffs' proceeding on the basis that the court lacked jurisdiction to hear the matter. Application granted; proceeding stayed pending submission to arbitration or any other form of proceeding that is permitted under the statutory enactments applicable; if no application is made to lift the stay within two years, the action will stand dismissed. Where there is a threshold question of whether the dispute is arbitrable, that decision should initially be made, absent very limited exceptions, by an arbitrator and not by the court. It is irrelevant if the plaintiffs have now lost their rights to initiate the arbitration process.","The Halifax Regional Municipality Act, effective as of April 1, 1996, provided for the amalgamation of the municipal police forces into the HRM. The plaintiffs were part of a Bargaining Unit represented by the Municipal Association of Police Personnel (MAPP). The Board of Police Commissioners declined to consider the matter on the basis it had no jurisdiction to convene an investigation or inquiry since there was no evidence any demotion was the result of a disciplinary default. HELD: The statement of claim was struck out. The court found that the issues were matters which fell within the exclusive dispute resolution process established under the TUA. As the nature of the dispute arose from the interpretation, application, administration and potential violation of the terms of the collective agreement, the plaintiffs were bound by the provisions of that collective agreement pursuant to s. 41 of the TPUA and the statutory freeze which resulted in collective agreement negotiations between the police and MAPP. The issues were whether the Board had jurisdiction to inquire into the complaint and to fix the appropriate remedy.  1)In addressing the limits of the court's jurisdiction, including where the plaintiff's rights as police officers are individual as opposed to collective rights, the court had to take the appropriate step. 2)The plaintiff's claim that the two-tier system for a sergeant violated s. 35(1) of the Regulations made under the Police Act. Section 41(7) recognizes an exception where the employer is able to obtain the consent of the 'certified or recognized bargaining agent' or the Board to alter terms and conditions of employment. The statutory freeze does not apply because the plaintiff was not a member of the bargaining unit under the previous collective agreement. Rather, it was a means for a union member to challenge provisions in a collective agreement where they believed they were contravening the statute. This is especially so when it is considered whether there is an effective remedy."

Quite apart from certification and voluntary recognition, the union could attain bargaining rights pursuant to Part II of the Trade Union Act, which allowed an employer in the construction industry to assign bargaining and negotiating rights to an 'accredited employers' association' such as the Construction Management Labour Bureau Ltd. The Court ordered the Minister to exercise his discretion under s.107(4) of the Act according to law as set out in Part II of the Act and confirmed by the Appeal Division in Boyd &amp; Garland.","This was an appeal of a decision which overturned the respondent's claim that the applicant was not a party to a voluntary recognition agreement. Dismissing the appeal, that the Minister of Labour and Manpower had misinterpreted a point of law by stating that there were only two methods by which a union can obtain bargaining rights for the employees. The applicant had entered into a rather hybrid scheme of labour relations applicable to the construction industry. The Deputy Minister had also entered into an agreement with the Labour Management Bureau, which was an accredited employers' association. These provisions provide for a third method of union recognition quite apart from certification and voluntary recognition.

The onus is on the applicant to provide cogent, independent or objective verification of change of circumstances. This application was brought 10 months after the pre-trial conference. It was of no consequence that someone may come into the home rather than using commercial day care service. There was no change in the father's hours of work or the schedule. The only change was that the mother was no longer available to provide care during Saturday of his access weekends. The mother was not to schedule activities during the father's access periods without his consent and he was to provide 7 days written notice if he chooses not to exercise access during specified times. This was not a variation of the custody/access regime but rather specific directions to provide some predictability for the children.","The parties applied to vary the child support provisions of the consent judgment, including his contribution to child care expenses and access provisions. The respondent claimed that his income had been reduced and referred to his 1999 tax return indicating an income of $42,386.34. The petitioner argued that this change was material and that his mother was no longer available to provide child care for the children. HELD: The application was dismissed with costs to the petitioner fixed in the amount of $1,000.  1)Once a material change becomes apparent, the question becomes whether there has been any material change in the respondent's circumstances. Once it becomes apparent that the matter has been asked of the respondent, the issue of child support ought to be revisited. 2)The respondent provided no evidence as to the amount, the method or when his father provided him with 'gifts' as he describes them. He did not suggest that there had been any change in his hours of work or work schedule. What had changed is that his father had died prior to the pre-trial conference and he no longer offered child care during the day on the Saturday of his access weekends."

The plaintiff claims she told the Town Office to shut off her water supply and the failure to do so let to the damages being sustained. HELD: The claim is dismissed. 1) There is no evidence that the plaintiff gave clear instructions to the town to shut off her water. 2) The proximate cause of the damage was turning off the heat and power without ensuring that water line, toilets, and the water tank had been properly drained. 3) The plaintiff sustained no damages herself. She admits she negotiated the sale price of $50,000 with her daughter prior to any damage being sustained to the property.

Any claim would have to be made by her daughter not her.","The plaintiff brought an action for water damage sustained to her former residence when frozen pipes burst. She claimed the Town of Martensville instructed her to shut off her water supply and the failure to do so led to the damages being sustained. The plaintiff’s claim was dismissed. The court could not find clear instructions were given to the town to disconnect the water service. The form executed by the plaintiff clearly indicated request for final billing. The evidence demonstrated a misunderstanding at best between what the plaintiff believed she was requesting and what in fact she did instruct. This cannot be construed as negligence in the circumstances by the town nor does the fact that specific forms are now utilized for disconnect purposes, elevate the likelihood of the plaintiff suffering damage to her property."

The respondent states that he has paid child support pursuant to the court order of February 2000 but, when the children reached the age of majority, he reduced the amount of child support payable as the children became independent and moved out on their own. The petitioner takes issue with the respondent's unilateral reduction in child support and submits the children remained children within the meaning of the Divorce Act so long as they were attending university. The parties agree that given the age of the children there has been a change in circumstance sufficient to allow a review of the existing child support order. HELD: 1) The parties agree that Jill, age 26 is no longer a child of the marriage and that Luke, age 21 is not presently a child of the marriage but could once again become a child of the marriage if he attends university in the fall of 2008. The parties also agree Keegan is 18 and remains a child of the marriage by virtue of the fact that he is taking classes at the university. 2) While the respondent asks that he be allowed to pay child support directly to the children, there is nothing in the material filed which would indicate that the petitioner is not providing support to the child in an appropriate fashion. Further, the difficulties that would arise in respect to enforcement of the order if the child support payments were not made directly to the petitioner would mitigate against such a variation.","FIAT: On September 19, 2007, the respondent filed an application for an order varying child support. The parties agree that given the age of the children, and their change in the amount of support payable by the respondent, that there has been a change in circumstances sufficient to allow a review of the existing child support order. HELD: 1) The children remain children of the marriage within the meaning of the Divorce Act.  2) The respondent's application for variation requested that he be allowed to pay any maintenance payable for the two children directly to the respondent so that the children no longer qualify as a child of that marriage within that meaning. 3) In the case of Bowman v. Bowman, 2005 SKQB, 260 SaskR. 312, the Manitoba Court of Appeal suggested a three step process in dealing with support orders for children who have reached a certain age of majority. Each case must be considered on its own facts. The guiding principle is reasonableness. Although initially the parties were at odds concerning the three children, by the time of their latest submissions they had a consensus that the respondent's share would be 33% or $2,667, and the parties agreed that Luke, now 26 years of age and on his own and could once again become a child, but could once more become a parent if he attended university as he did in the fall of 2007. It is well-settled that full time attendance in a post-secondary education program may result in a child over the Age of majority qualifying as a 'child' within this meaning. However, this may not be the case for all three children. In this case the respondent shall pay $380 per month plus 33% of s. expenses with such payments to continue on the first day of each and every month until such time as the said child, Keegan, is no longer subject to the child support payments and therefore must be paid directly to him. In the interim payments made will be applied firstly towards the ongoing child support for Keegan and then towards the arrears. As success has been divided, there will be no order as to costs."
9_2006skca114.txt,"This is an application for leave to appeal, and leave being granted, an appeal by the Crown from a sentence imposed against a young offender pursuant to the Youth Criminal Justice Act. The respondent pled guilty to a charge of robbery, an offence contrary to s. 344(b) of the Criminal Code. The respondent was sentenced to 90 days secure custody, 45 days community supervision, 1 year probation and a 10 year firearms prohibition. HELD: Appeal allowed orally. The sentence is set aside and a sentence of 12 months closed custody, 6 months community supervision, 1 year probation and a 10 year firearms prohibition was imposed in addition to the 90 days closed custody already served at the time of the appeal.  1) It was clear that the primary concern of the sentencing judge was that, in the wake of the Supreme Court of Canada decision in R. v. B.W.P.; R. v. B.V.N. 2006 SCC 27, a custodial sentence might not be open to him at all. It is the Court's view that the sentencing judge's conclusion that the decision in B.W.P. virtually ruled out custodial sentences for young persons under the Youth Criminal Justice Act was unwarranted. The gist of that decision is that under the Act the principle of general deterrence is not a factor to be taken into account and cannot be used to justify a sentence harsher than the circumstances of the offender and the offence would warrant. Nor is specific deterrence to be considered as a separate factor. 2) It is the Court's view that a long custodial sentence is necessary to accomplish the task of bringing the seriousness of the offence to the respondent's attention, and provide meaningful consequences to reinforce societal values without negatively affecting the respondent's likelihood of rehabilitation.","This was an application for leave to appeal and, leave being granted, an appeal by the Crown from a sentence imposed against a young offender pursuant to the Youth Criminal Justice Act, S.C. 2002, c. 1. The respondent pled guilty to a charge of robbery, an offence contrary to s. 344(b) of the Criminal Code, and was sentenced to 90 days secure custody, 45 days community supervision, one year probation and a 10 year firearms prohibition. The sentence was set aside and a sentence of 12 months closed custody, 6 months community supervision and 1 year probation was imposed in addition to the 90 days closed custody already served. HELD: The sentence imposed was demonstrably unfit, failing to take into account the seriousness of the offence, the culpability of the respondent, the criminal history and other circumstances of the offender, and his need for psychological and substance abuse counseling and further education. 1) The respondent had already served the 90 day closed custody portion of the sentence originally imposed. That sentence was to be set aside. 2) The sentencing judge focused considerable attention on the decision of the Supreme Court in B.W.P., which stated that closed custody must be employed only rarely and in unusual circumstances. 3) The principles of general deterrence and deterrence were not a factor to be taken into account and could not be used to justify a sentence harsher than the offence would warrant. Nor was specific deterrence to be considered as a separate factor."
8_2001skca55.txt,"The Crown sought leave to appeal a conditional sentence of 9 months of time served plus 2 years less 1 day, including 3 months on electronic monitoring, and 2 years probation with a 10 year firearm prohibition on each charge to be served concurrently. The sentence was imposed for robbery with threats of violence contrary to s.348(1)(b) and s.334(2) of the Criminal Code which were committed in March 2000 while the accused was on probation. The appellant and co-accused were convicted of breaking and entering a private residence. The accused took $25 from the premises and held the 68 year old victim while the co-accused went to look for a knife after threatening to cut off his fingers. The following day the two accused used threats of violence while robbing a pharmacy and a witness testified the accused yelled to the co-accused to kill the victims. The co-accused who was convicted of assault received 7 years in prison for the robbery concurrent with 5 years for the B &amp; E. The 23 year old aboriginal who had a Grade 3 education had a prior record of 42 criminal convictions including eight violent or weapons related offences. HELD: Leave was granted. The appeal was allowed. The sentence of 4 years in prison on each charge to be served concurrently took into account time served on remand and electronic monitoring. The sentence was demonstrably unfit and fell outside the range of sentences previously imposed. The sentencing judge relied solely on the principle of rehabilitation, essentially ignoring the other sentencing principles including the level of gravity, the principle of deterrence, the need to denounce such acts, the sentence imposed on the co-accused, and the need to protect the public. A sentencing circle was inappropriate given the level of violence, his risk to re-offend, his consistent ignoring or refusal to follow court orders, and the fact that a penitentiary term was called for in such circumstances. He had violated various forms of community release orders including bail and probation 16 times. He had a history of drug and alcohol abuse and had not attended treatment.","The Crown sought leave to appeal the sentence imposed on the respondent after a sentencing circle. The respondent plead guilty to two offences of robbery and robbery with threats of violence contrary to s.348(1)(b) and 334(2) of the Criminal Code, and was sentenced to 9 months time served, plus 2 years less 1 day conditional, including 3 months on electronic monitoring, plus two years probation with a ten year firearms prohibition on each charge to be served concurrently. The Crown appealed the sentence. HELD: The sentencing circle was inappropriate in these circumstances given the level of violence, the respondent's high risk to reoffend, his consistent ignoring of or refusing to follow court orders and the fact a penitentiary term was called for. The Court was all of the view leave should be granted and the appeal allowed. The sentence imposed was essentially the same sentence as imposed in St. Francis v. Severight, 2000 SKCA 49 (CanLII), 189 Sask. R. 291."
4_2005skqb279.txt,"The plaintiff claims damages for injuries sustained when he was punched in the face and knocked unconscious by the defendant. Liability is admitted. The plaintiff applies for summary judgment pursuant to Rule 485 of the Queen's Bench Rules. The parties agree that damages should be assessed on the basis of the affidavit evidence. HELD: 1) The defendant pled guilty to a charge of assault causing bodily harm. He was sentenced to a fine of $1,500, placed on probation for 18 months and ordered to make restitution to the plaintiff for the cost of the dental work in the amount of $3,263.30. 2) The plaintiff suffered serious injuries and significant pain for a number of months after the assault. Extensive dental treatment was required and will be required at some point in the future. The plaintiff has minimal scarring. He is awarded general damages of $12,500. 3) The pleadings and the affidavit evidence do not support a substantial award for aggravated damages. However, the photographs graphically depict the extent to which his appearance was altered. Hurt feelings can reasonably be inferred from the fact that the plaintiff was rendered unconscious on the ground in a crowd of onlookers. These circumstances justify an award of aggravated damages in the sum of $2,000. 4) The plaintiff was awarded special damages in the amount of $1,911.70.","The plaintiff was standing with other patrons near the entrance to a pub when he was punched in the face and knocked unconscious by the defendant. The parties agree that damages should be assessed on the basis of the affidavit evidence filed. They also agree that the court would be in no better position to make that assessment following trial. HELD: The plaintiff was awarded general damages in the amount of $12,500.00, plus costs and pre-judgment interest.  Adding in aggravated damages, a fair award for general damages of $2,000.00. In assessing general damages, the Court of Appeal referred to Rieger v. Burgess, another case in which a trial judge reassessed the amount awarded by jury for non-pecuniary loss. The Court reviewed Queen's Bench Rule 153 (which requires a party to plead specifically any matter, fact or point of law which, if not specifically pleaded, might take the other party by surprise) and found that a fair value for general damage was $16,411.70."
6_2000skqb94.txt,"A jury determined the plaintiff was constructively dismissed from his employment as park superintendent in 1997 and awarded damages for failure to give reasonable notice. The defendant claimed the contract of employment was all inclusive; that the plaintiff exaggerated the amount of time he spent on the job in winter; that the reduced winter hours were not in lieu of overtime pay as he was a manager within the meaning of s.4(2) of the LSA; the doctrine of estoppel or waiver applied as he never claimed a right to holiday pay for 10 years and the employer relied on his not doing so; if the plaintiff is entitled to holiday pay he should only recover back to April 1990 as he is limited by the Limitation of Actions Act; it should not be based on wages plus truck allowance as wages as defined in the LSA does not include allowances for costs. The claim for unpaid holiday pay claimed from April 1988 to October 1997, based on his wages plus one-half his truck expense allowance, was reserved pending a decision by the Court of Appeal as to whether the Court of Queen's Bench has jurisdiction to determine the issue of entitlement to holiday pay. HELD: The claim was dismissed with costs.  1)The Court of Appeal held in Kolodziejski v. Auto Electric Service that the Queens' Bench has jurisdiction to entertain a civil action for non-payment of holiday pay. 2)The plaintiff may rely on s.30(1) of the LSA to establish he is entitled to holidays and on s.33 to establish he entitled to pay in lieu of taking holidays. The onus then shifts to the defendant to prove it complied with some exception in the LSA. Section 75 prevents an employee from waiving his or her entitlement. Whether the plaintiff asserted his right to holiday pay or not, he remained entitled to his annual holidays in accordance with the LSA. 3)The plaintiff can claim for any holiday pay in lieu of time off that he can establish he was entitled to from April 1990 to his termination date. Section 3(1)(f)of the LAA states that a cause of action for recovery of money under a contract, express or implied, must be commenced within 6 years of the date on which the cause arose. 4)The plaintiff clearly indicated that a portion of the truck allowance was made to avoid paying tax. As such it would be contrary to public policy for the Court to appear to endorse the plaintiff's actions by calculating his holiday pay on the basis of his wage and this portion of his truck allowance.  5)The defendant's position that the contract included a component of holiday pay each month was inconsistent with its position that the plaintiff took these days off as holidays during the year. The contract of employment did not include a component of holiday pay in lieu of time off.  6)Failure by the defendant to keep records for the purpose of inspection by the minister does not result in a reverse onus. The onus remains on the plaintiff to establish what holidays he did not take. 7)The plaintiff admitted to taking time away from his duties for personal time and for city business as mayor. The plaintiff was not there in his capacity as superintendent. Section 31(1)(b) indicates that an employee shall be permitted to take holidays in one uninterrupted period. The defendant allowed the plaintiff to take days off in any manner he chose. It was inconsistent that the plaintiff's failure to comply with the notice requirement meant for the benefit of the employer could be used by an employee to disclaim that his days off were holidays. 8)The plaintiff was clearly a manager within the meaning of LSA. Even if he were not a manager, he failed to prove, on a balance of probabilities that he worked overtime hours in excess of the statutory minimum in order to qualify for overtime. Any days off taken by the plaintiff could not be considered taken in lieu of overtime. The days he was away were holidays as defined in s.30 of the LSA. 9)He did not establish he did 3 weeks holidays.","The plaintiff sued for damages from the defendant alleging he was constructively wrongfully dismissed from his employment with the defendant. The plaintiff elected to have the determination of liability and the assessment of damages determined by a civil jury. At the time of the jury trial, the issue of whether the defendant's jurisdiction to deal with entitlement to holiday pay was being determined by the Court of Appeal for Saskatchewan. HELD: 1)The plaintiff's hours of work were very flexible in the winter. It was only in the first winter of his employment that he was required to be at work 30 hours per week, which he did. The defendant asserted that the plaintiff never claimed his right to holidays or holiday pay for 10 years and that the defendant relied on the plaintiff's conduct in this regard. 2)There were several preliminary issues which must be dealt with. First, the defendant claimed holiday pay should not be based on his wage and truck allowance as it was really part of his wage. 3)If the court finds that the plaintiffs' contract was not all-inclusive or that it did not exceed the minimum standards set out in the LSA, the plaintiff should be considered to have waived this entitlement by his conduct over the years. 4)It would be contrary to public policy for the defendant to appear to endorse the plaintiff’s actions by calculating his holiday pay on the basis of his wages and this portion of his truck allowance was to be added to the award of damages in lieu of proper notice. In the alternative the defendant claims that the doctrine of estoppel or waiver should apply to prevent the plaintiff from claiming his entitlement to holidays and the defendant asserts that it would be substantially prejudiced if the plaintiff was now allowed to assert that right. 5)In this case the plaintiff clearly indicated that the $250.00 portion of the truck allowance were made to avoid paying tax. He also asserted that holiday pay in excess of $1,000 should be included in any computation of holiday pay, in the event the plaintiff is awarded the holiday pay. 6)In any event the defendant would be compelled to rebut the presumption arising out of the meaning of the Labour Standards Act by rebutting the presumption in accordance with some exception in the Act. The onus, therefore, is upon the plaintiff to establish that he is entitled to holidays. 7)The onus and burden in wrongful dismissal cases rests with the plaintiff. The court can rely on a presumption arising from the wording of the Act to meet his burden to establish his damage. The"
b_1995canlii6024.txt,"The accuseds were charged under ss.300 and 301 of the Code with (i)committing and (ii)publishing a defamatory libel against a police officer. They filed a plea of justification as permitted under s.611(1) of the Code. The Crown denied the truth of the plea pursuant to s.611(4) and the matter proceeded to trial. At the opening of their trial the accuseds applied for an order declaring ss.300 and 301 of the Criminal Code to be of no force and effect on the basis that they constituted an unreasonable limitation on their rights and freedoms guaranteed under ss.2, 7 and 11 of the Charter. The Crown admitted that ss.300 and 301 limited an individual's right to freedom of expression as provided by s.2 of the Charter but argued that this infringement was justified under s.1 of the Charter. HELD: Application allowed in part.  1)The onus of justifying the limitation of a right or freedom is on the party seeking to uphold the limitation and the standard of proof is by a preponderance of probability. 2)The standards against which a limit on a right or freedom guaranteed by the Charter can be shown to be reasonable and demonstrably justified are those underlying values and principles essential to a free and democratic society. While the right of free speech is important in our society, it is not unrestricted. 3)In order to justify an infringement of this right, it must be shown that: (i)the impugned legislative provision has an objective of pressing and substantial concern and (ii)there is a proportionality to the legislation in that: (a)the measures must be fair and not arbitrary, carefully designed to achieve the objective in question and rationally connected to the objective; (b)the means should impair freedom of expression as little as possible; (c)there must be a proportionality between the effects of the limiting legislation and the objective. S.300 of the Code meets these tests, and is therefore a reasonable limit on free speech and is valid. 4)Ss.611 and 612 of the Code, which permit a plea of justification do not create a reverse onus on the accused. They are procedural and merely serve to put the Crown on notice as to the accused's defence. The Crown must still prove that the alleged defamatory libel is knowingly false beyond a reasonable doubt. 5)S.301 of the Code makes it an offence to publish a defamatory libel whether or not the accused believes it to be true. S.301 is therefore not a reasonable limit and is invalid. ADDENDUM: The Court ordered that the agreed statement of facts set out at pp. 2 and 3 of the judgment not be published nor broadcast in any manner.","The accused applied for a declaration that s. 300 of the Criminal Code constitutes an unreasonable limitation of one or more of the rights and freedoms guaranteed by s. 2, s. 11(c) and s. of the Charter. HELD: Application dismissed. 1)The accused were found guilty of three counts of defamatory libel and one count of publishing without lawful justification or excuse that was likely to injure the reputation of a police officer by exposing him to hatred, contempt or ridicule or that was designed toinsult the police officer knowing that the matter published was false. 2)There was a rational connection between the objectives of protecting the privacy and reputations of persons in s.300 of the Code and the limitation on freedom of expression as guaranteed under s.2(b). The threshold test for the application of s. has been met. 3)S.300 is of sufficient importance to justify an infringement of s 2(b)of the Charter (except in R. v. Oakes). The impugned legislative provision has an objective of pressing and substantial concern. It is not arbitrary, unfair or based on irrational considerations. 4)The Court must balance the value of freedom and the principles of fundamental justice, which are the foundation of free and democratic society, against the limitation placed on it by the limiting legislation. The Court must also consider all expression that is potentially restricted by the Code, not only the expressions involved in this case."
b_1991canlii4497.txt,"A large diseased elm tree fell on a truck and injured the plaintiff driver. For some years prior to the accident, the defendant had operated a hazardous tree removal program. An inspector had examined the tree that fell. The inspector had no expertise relating to trees or their diseases, nor did his immediate superior. For the plaintiff, that there is a prima fade duty of care owed by the Department of Transportation to users of highway against reasonably foreseeable hazards, including the falling of trees onto the highway. Further, the defendant had a duty to use a reasonable standard of care in the operation of the hazardous tree removal program. The defendant was negligent in failing to train the inspector properly. The Court referred at length to the Supreme Court of Canada decision in Just v. British Columbia. The defendant's claim against the third parties (owners/occupiers of property on which tree stood) was dismissed.","A tree fell on a half ton truck driven by the plaintiff, who was a paraplegic. For the defendant, that the tree had been in sufficient proximity to the plaintiff to come within the purview of his duty of care in regard to the removal of trees which were an immediate hazard to the public. The plaintiff sued the defendants, the owners of the property and the defendants' occupiers, for failing to provide proper maintenance of the trees. Dismissing the action with costs, that in order to establish whether a governmental policy decision arises in a particular situation, it must be determined whether it is a policy decision of a government agency and thus exempt from liability. Here the plaintiff was able to demonstrate that his condition was stabilized by careful inspection of the tree, careful examination of the stump, and a detailed analysis of the bore, bark, and leaves to determine whether the tree was a model or a construction site."
d_2009skqb70.txt,"At issue is the amount of Income Replacement Benefits (IRB) payable to the appellant by SGI. The parties agree that the calculation of the IRB as provided by s. 117 of the Act is the annualized sum of $28,889.75. The appellant takes issue with SGI's reduction of the amount determined in accordance with s. 117 of the Act by calculating the appellant's net income in accordance with s. 135 to s. 138 of the Act. HELD: SGI has correctly calculated the appellant's IRB when it made the requisite deductions as set out in s. 137 to find the appellant's net income, and then reduced the net income to 90% to determine his IRB. It would be neither a rational nor fair interpretation to reduce a full-time earner's IRB by 90% and not the other types of earners. It would be neither a rational nor fair interpretation to deduct income tax, employment insurance premiums and Canada Pension contributions from only full-time earners. All earners are subject to these payments being deducted from their income but for their inability to earn an income because of an automobile accident. The further deductions to obtain the non- earner's IRB are in keeping with his earning reality.","The appellant's IRB for the 181st and subsequent days following an accident was not less than the IRB calculated for the first 180 days as determined pursuant to s. 116 of the Automobile Accident Insurance Act. The appellant argued that the Act is intended to correlate the non-earner's income replacement benefit against which s. 117(4) is designed to be measured is that of a 'weighted average' calculation. The parties brought the matter back for further determination because SGI was paying the appellant an amount less than that. HELD: The appeal was dismissed and the appellant was not entitled to any costs from SGI. Although the hearing judge erred in holding that the income replacement fund (IRB) for the post 180 day period was not reduced by 90% as SGI had argued, it would be neither a rational nor fair interpretation to reduce the respondent's IRBT by 90%. 1) The Court of Appeal referred the matter of determination of the calculation of the Roth Benefits for Non-earners by reference to the respondent. Counsel for the appellant appealed the SGI's calculation of interest on monies owed to the appellant on the basis of pre-judgment interest. 2) The phrase'subject to the other provisions of the Division' as meaning 'governed by' or 'affected by' the provisions of this Division is a too restrictive definition of the phrase. Section 207 of the Act and Regulation 101 contemplate the payment of claimant's solicitor and client costs if the claimant is successful on appeal. 3) The hearing judge raised no concern with respect to the weighted average approach used by SGI in calculating the respondent’s IRB when it made the requisite deductions as set out in s. 137 and then reduced the net income to 90%."

The complainant described certain incidents that amounted to sexual assault when she was under the age of 16. The Respondent had previously been acquitted of charges based on the same allegations in criminal court. The Respondent has abused a child within the meaning of the Act. Although the standard of proof is on the balance of probabilities, it is elevated with the seriousness of the allegations and their implications. However, it is considerably less than proof beyond a reasonable doubt.","The Agency applied for a finding that the father had abused a child pursuant to s. 62(a) or (c) of the Children and Family Services Act. The mother of the child had stayed with the father when he was seventy-seven years old and had never been married or lived with a woman, just him and his dog. The daughter had sexual contact with him when she was eleven or twelve years old. These sexual incidents came to light when the daughter and her grandfather were watching a television program about sexual assault. The father was tried and acquitted of sexual assault in criminal court. The child's credibility had not been impeached. The evidence of the alleged assault had more probability of truth than disbelief. Although the standard of proof is 'on a balance of probabilities' courts have considered the Standard of Proof elevated with the seriousness of the allegations and its implications (considerably less, however, than proof beyond a reasonable doubt)."
4_2000canlii2633.txt,"The parties were married for 14 years and separated in 1995, entering into a detailed Separation Agreement in 1998. The two children of the marriage are 16 and 8 years of age. There was a long history of relatively short terms of employment and several moves to take employment. The respondent had a grade 12 education and some university courses but no practical skills or training. For the past 3 years, the respondent had made no reasonable efforts for employment, developed no skills of a practical nature, and derived her income from child support payments and the Child Tax Credit and by incurring debt in excess of $20,000.00 The parties had entered bankruptcy during the course of the marriage and had no assets or savings or pension entitlement at the time of separation or acquired since. The petitioner now earned an annual salary of $115,500.00. The Agreement did not address the level of child support in accordance with the Federal Child Support Guidelines, nor did it provide for practical retaining by the Respondent to facilitate employment. This was an exceptional situation that required some adjustment to the Agreement reached by the parties. The court ordered the establishment of a retraining fund of $6,500.00 with direct payments to whatever institution the Respondent may choose. Limited spousal support was to terminate on the earlier of completion of the retraining allowance or transfer of the balance of the outstanding to the Respondent on September 1st, 2001. An adjustment was also made to account for arrears in child support and child support payments.","The parties separated 14 years ago. There have been a number of Interim Applications and Interim Orders since their separation. The petitioner husband, now 44, applied for and was granted a divorce judgment on the basis of the Partial Agreement and Minutes of Settlement. The parties had entered into a partial agreement in early 2000 which provided for joint care and custody of the children with their primary residence being with their mother and fixing her with the responsibility for their day to day care. In addition, the petitioner's employer paid $6,000 per year for medical and other benefits separate from the post tax deductions for long term disabilities and the petitioner paid an additional $8,000 in U.S. dollars for holidays with his sons. HELD: The petitioner was awarded $4,800 in costs plus additional costs of $83.00 per month for the transfer of American funds to Canada by draft. It must be acknowledged that if the Agreement contained a level of child support consistent with the Federal Child Support Guidelines and had been in form acceptable to the Prothonotary Office, then quite probably the Divorce Judgment would have been granted as of that date and the Corollary Relief Judgment would also have been issued. There would not be any jurisdiction remaining open for the court to make a limited realistic adjustment to the Agreement."

The defendants had previously been permitted to re-open judgments obtained against them and had filed defences. Prior to that they had consistently failed to attend examinations in aid of execution. Contempt proceedings had been commenced against them but were adjourned sine die at the time the defendants were permitted to defend. The defendants resisted the application on the basis that they were now non-residents and not compellable by an appointment, and that the designated officer of the defendant corporation was no longer an officer. This information had not been communicated to the plaintiff's solicitor who had acted in good faith on information given to him previously by the solicitors for the defendants. The examinations had been scheduled unilaterally because the defendants' solicitor consistently refused or neglected to return phone calls or correspondence from the plaintiff's solicitors. HELD: The judge refused to strike the defences holding that in the circumstances Queen's Bench Rule 231 did not apply. He also held that the defendants, considering their conduct throughout the whole course of the lawsuit, were in contempt and ordered them to attend without conduct money any examinations unilaterally scheduled by the plaintiff failing agreement between counsel as to dates. Costs were fixed at $1,500 in any event of the cause and were ordered to be paid within two weeks.","The plaintiff applied to strike the statement of defence of the corporate defendant on the ground that the designated officer of the corporation failed to appear at an examination for discovery on November 23, 1993. The plaintiff's solicitors had on several occasions telephoned the defendant's solicitor to schedule examinations for discovery and to obtain statements as to documents. None of the appointments were made. Late in the proceedings, the plaintiff's solicitor sent a letter to the defendants' solicitor suggesting a range of dates for the examinations. This letter indicated that if no reply was made by October 25, 1993, the examinations would be unilaterally scheduled. This decision was appealed. HELD: 1)The Court was satisfied on the basis of the conduct exhibited throughout the whole of these proceedings that the defendants were guilty of contempt of court. The defendants had abused the discretion of the court that was exercised in their favour to set aside judgments obtained against them and to permit them to file defences. 2)The non-attendances of the defendants in 1993 did not constitute'refusing or neglecting to attend' within the meaning of Rule 231. It could not be utilized respecting these particular non- attendances to strike their statements of defence. The contempt proceedings were still before the court even though they were adjourned sine die."
1998canlii3382.txt,"The appellant employer and the respondent union are parties to a collective agreement with effect from January 1, 1994 to December 31, 1996. The collective agreement established employee salaries for that period, with annual adjustments on January 1st of each year. Shortly before the agreement was signed, the Public Sector Compensation Act was passed, which rolled back and froze public sector salaries. In a letter to the union, the employer confirmed the wage increases provided for in the agreement would be paid to the employees as a lump sum following the expiration of the legislated wage freeze. After the expiration of the wage freeze, however, the employer refused to pay the lump sum on the grounds that it would contravene the Act. The union sued the employer in the Supreme Court, claiming the lump sum or, in the alternative, damages for negligent misrepresentation. The employer applied to strike the Statement of Claim on the grounds that the union's claims were within the exclusive jurisdiction of an arbitrator. The Chambers judge dismissed the application. The employer appealed. Allowing the appeal and staying the action pending submission to arbitration as provided for in the collective agreement, that the Chambers judge erred in allowing the action to continue. Where there is a doubt about the arbitrability of a dispute, that issue should generally be determined at arbitration. This reflects the central role of arbitration in collective bargaining labour relations, recognizes that arbitration is the forum best suited to conducting the necessary inquiry, and helps ensure that no one, absent sound reasons, will be left with rights but no effective remedy.","The appellant was an employer and the respondent union. By successorship, they were parties to a collective agreement signed in 1994. The collective agreement establishes employee salaries for that period and is properly regulated through arbitration. The employer appealed the employer's application to strike the union's statement of claim on the ground that the claims were within the exclusive jurisdiction of an arbitrator. The respondent appealed, seeking leave for this purpose. At issue was whether the letter of July 22, 1994 was an ancillary document and whether it forms part of the collective agreement. Appeal allowed; the Chambers judge dismissed the application; the appeal should be directed to arbitration. There were several factual questions that could not be explored on an application under Rule 14.25, but the proper course was to direct a stay of the action which could be lifted by a judge of the Supreme Court in appropriate circumstances."
