2003skqb487.txt,"At issue was the interim custody of the child and child support. HELD: Interim custody was given to the petitioner with access to the respondent. The respondent was ordered to pay interim child support in the amount of $193 per month. On an interim custody application, the Court must take into account the status quo.","At issue on this application is the interim custody of the child of the petitioner and the respondent. The parties began to cohabit in 1998. In May 1999, the parties would'switch Keanna every second day' and that after that the respondent had access to every second weekend until November 2002 when the petitioner ended access. The respondent made no attempts at gaining custody until he was served with the application of the mother. HELD: The child has and does reside with the petitioner, with access and visitation arrangements to the husband. The petitioner has and has a loving, stable relationship with her mother. Notwithstanding the instances of suspended access, the arrangements for access appear to be in the petitioner's best interests. There is plenty of affidavit evidence to support the conclusion that both parties are loving parents to their child. The mutual love and acceptance demonstrated by the families and relatives of each party is self-evident and commendable.  1) The purpose of an interim custody order is to give person the right and duty to care for child until a permanent order or another interim order is made. On an interim application, the focus differs from that of a permanent custody hearing. Rather than focussing on the long-term best interests of a child, court tends to focus on the short-term needs of the children. As a result, interim orders usually reinforce the status quo in an attempt to reflect on the best interests and the child will likely be affected to varying degrees by the discord between the parties. 2) The petitioner is entitled to reasonable access."
2_2012nssc10.txt,"Rule 77.03 – Liability for costsThe court found in favor of the respondents after a half-day chambers hearing. They sought solicitor-client costs or costs under Tariff C, with a multiplier of four for a total of $12,000 given the applicants' conduct and their failure to include important information in their claim. Held, party-and-party costs of $6,000 awarded to the respondents, using Tariff C and a multiplier of two. This matter was sufficiently complex and important to the parties that it required significant preparation and effort to prepare/review the evidence and conduct the hearing. While they did omit relevant information, the applicants' conduct wasn't so outrageous, scandalous or reprehensible that it warranted an award of solicitor-client costs. The dispute was acrimonious, but the litigation was generally conducted in a civil manner.","The Bowsers were successful as Respondents in Chambers, seeking a declaration that there were were entitled to right-of-way across the land of the Bowsers and seeking mandatory injunction and permanent injunction as well as damages for the loss of use and enjoyment of their properties. The Sheas, by omitting some important information in making their claim, undermined the strength of their claim. They applied for costs on a solicitor client basis. Rule 77.01(1)(a) and 77.02(1) of the New Rules make it clear that the winning party in the litigation is presumptively entitled to partial compensation of their expenses of litigation. Customarily this has been viewed as substantial, but not complete, indemnification of the expenses of the litigation. As in many other cases, the dispute concerns to what extent there should be partial compensation. The Bowsers suggest $12,000 plus disbursements, whereas the Sheas suggest $5500. Both parties file an Affidavit of Contest and submit hard copies of it. The applicants faxed the Notice of Contest on September 14, 2011 and then filed hard copies on October 5, 2011. Those were subsequently rejected by court staff and were re-filed. The Court found that the total cost to the respondents in the amount of $6000 was $302.75. The court allowed the application for a multiplier of two to bring the total costs to $1,000. It is not one of those rare cases where solicitor client costs should be awarded. Party and Party Costs The Court awarded $2,000 to the applicants for the cost of preparing the affidavit and then applying the multiplier to the total number of applications. The amount of money consumed in chambers is not an issue in this case."

The theft of a computer and modem exceeding $1,000 in value contrary to s.334(a) of the Criminal Code and mischief by damaging a motor vehicle and damaging the vehicle to gain entry into it, and from which he stole the computer and a modem. 12 months to be served concurrently with the first offence on the theft charge. At issue was whether the sentence should be increased or reduced. HELD: Appeal dismissed. 1)The sentence imposed was unfair. 2)The trial judge was correct in his remarks that general deterrence must be a matter of primary concern. 3)The appellant could not be described as a youthful first offender. His record of criminal convictions began in 1980 and included 19 times theft and property related offences."
2007nspc30.txt,"Immediately after the complainant accused the defendant of stealing lumber from his property and directed him to remain off the property, the defendant entered upon the complainant's property in a state of anger to challenge the complainant's authority to issue such a direction. The complainant armed himself with a knife when the defendant entered the property, at which point the defendant grabbed a shovel, moved towards the complainant, struck him on the arm with the shovel and punched him in the ribs while he was on the ground. The complainant suffered a fractured ulna bone and a fractured rib. The defendant, who was charged with aggravated assault, assault by using or threatening to use a weapon and possession of a weapon, claimed to have acted in self-defence. Defendant found guilty of all three charges; conviction entered only on the aggravated assault charge. The actions of the complainant were justifiable as using no more force than was necessary to prevent a perceived trespass; the defendant, who was under no imminent danger, and could reasonably have retreated  upon seeing the knife, instead chose to arm himself with a shovel and strike the complainant.","The accused was struck in the arm by the defendant's right hand as he walked down the driveway towards the property. The defendant had a shovel in his hand and the accused had a knife. The knife was not in the accused's hand as the defendant had pulled it out of his pants. The altercation continued and the defendant suffered fractures to his elbow and rib cage as result of the assault. The accused and the victim both suffered from fractures to their upper arm. The defence evidence established a prima facie case inasmuch as that evidence establishes that the defendant intentionally struck the victim and thereby granted him his right to enter a premises for the purpose of preventing a trespass. The Court found that the accused, by driving in anger to the complainant's property and entering thereon despite being told not to enter upon the property, placed himself in the role of an aggressor and thereby justified in using no more force than was necessary to prevent the perceived trespass. Although the accused denied having either a knife or a weapon, the defence evidence showed that he had a stick or a butcher knife."
b_1996canlii7148.txt,"A claim for damages to the plaintiff's leased automobile arising out an accident. The action against the defendant Ruhr had been discontinued. An SGI adjuster appraised the damage but during the course of repairing the vehicle further damage was found. A roving adjuster authorized the replacement of the exhaust system but deducted 20% for depreciation. The plaintiff brought an action for reimbursement of the $503.73 arguing that SGI elected to repair or replace the exhaust system under statutory condition 8(4) of s39 of the Automobile Accident Insurance Act. SGI took the position that as Crestview was the registered owner of the vehicle the plaintiff was not entitled to bring this action as he was not the insured within the meaning of the Act. SGI also argued that Crestview authorized the repairs and acknowledged the 20% deduction as registered owner and that if the plaintiff paid the $503.73 he did so under his private lease contract with Crestview. It also argued that it is entitled to deduct for depreciation in any event. HELD: The claim against SGI was dismissed with taxed costs.  1)An election under statutory condition 8(4) amounts to an irrevocable decision to repair regardless of costs of repairs. Once an election is made the insurer is bound to pay or reinstate. An insurer by its conduct may be deemed to make an election to reinstate. The insurer's election to reinstate unilaterally creates a new contract which the insurer may not unilaterally revoke. On the facts the insurer neither expressly nor by its conduct elected to reinstate. The roving appraiser provided an appraisal to Crestview which included the depreciation deduction. Crestview repaired the vehicle without advising the plaintiff. 2)The concept of waiver in insurance law encompasses an election to pay or to reinstate. Estoppel was not applicable. Two provisions of the Saskatchewan Act provide that SGI in certain situations is not deemed to have waived provisions of the Act. The roving appraiser reassessed the claim and included the newly found damages. These acts related to the appraisal of the claim and could not constitute a waiver of statutory condition 8(1). They did not constitute an election under statutory condition 8(4). Crestview, not SGI, took the steps to repair the vehicle. As the plaintiff did not receive a written waiver of statutory condition 8(1) pursuant to s77 the insurer could not be deemed to have waived its option to enforce statutory condition 8(1).  3)The exhaust system was three years old and had 46,000 km of wear. A 20% deduction for depreciation was appropriate and therefore allowed.  4)It was not necessary to determine whether the plaintiff was the 'insured' as defined by the Act.","A claim for damages to the plaintiff's leased car arising out of an automobile accident. The plaintiff claimed SGI's assistance to repair the damage to the car and sought reimbursement of the $503.73 deducted for depreciation. The insurer took the vehicle to a repair shop which was to be operated by Crestview and received an appraisal. The repair shop did not provide the plaintiff with the information it needed to determine the extent of the damage or the cost of reinstatement. HELD: The claim was dismissed. 1)An election to repair is an exercise in force pursuant to s. 39 of the Automobile Accident Insurance Act. An express election is not necessary. An insurer by its conduct may be deemed to have made an election to reinstate. 2)The definition of an election has received its own treatment. A reasonable insurer would not elect to reinist unless it had all the information and materials necessary to choose the most advantageous course of action. In the case of this case, Crestview was not entitled to that information. 3)An express election does not constitute an election. An election under the Act to repair involves the insurer making a payment to the repair shop for the repair. The actual cash value of the vehicle is not to exceed the cost to repair or replace the exhaust system as fixed by regulations. 4)If an insurer elects to repair, it must give the assured unequivocal notice that it intends to do so. 5)The claim is dismissed. 6)Costs are awarded to the lessee of vehicle registered to Crestview."
d_2006skqb251.txt,"Hayley is 7 years old. In this application each of her father, mother and maternal grandmother compete for some form of custody over her. The father seeks sole custody. The mother and grandmother seek joint custody with the father. The mother seeks to be designated as her daughter's primary caregiver. HELD: 1) The father and his wife Patricia have been the primary caregivers and psychological parents of Hayley for in excess of 2 years. The preservation of that important relationship when added to all other factors in this case tips the scales in favour of the father. 2) The family which has been Hayley's experience for the past 2 years, even if relocated to Calgary, is where the continuity, consistency and stability necessary to attain Hayley's best interests will be found. 3) The father must be the sole custodian of Hayley. He must consult with her mother. The evidence shows that the parties have not been able to maintain a functional parental relationship. Whether the mother establishes a new residence in Moose Jaw or Cold Lake, the distance relative to Calgary is significant. 4) A grandparent may be a person of sufficient interest if the relationship leads to the conclusion that such a relationship is beneficial to the child and consequently harmful if terminated. That is the first step. The second step arises only where the grandparent is found to be a person of sufficient interest. It proceeds with a review based on the best interest principle as enunciated by s. 9(1) of the Act. 5) The court was satisfied that the grandmother is a person of sufficient interest in Hayley's life and that if her relationship as grandmother to Hayley was thwarted by the actions of Hayley's parents, the result to Hayley would be harmful. There are situations, and this is one of them, where the court should curtail the tradition of access to a grandchild flowing from the parents who have the right to control the upbringing of their child and to determine what relationships the child shall be a party to. An independent right of access is needed to attain Hayley's best interests. The history and intensity of Hayley's relationship with her maternal grandmother weighs in favour of specifying access.","The father petitions for sole custody of his daughter, while each of the mother and maternal grandmother independently seek joint custody with the father. Hayley's mother seeks to be designated as her daughter's primary caregiver. HELD: 1) Hayley is seven years old. Since the commencement of these proceedings, each party and their extended families have chosen to relocate from the City of Moose Jaw. The Court has no other facts before it relating to the physical aspect of where Hayley might reside or go to school if she moves with her father to the city of Calgary.  2) The mother testified that she and her father had agreed that she would be the homemaker for the foreseeable future. It is clear that she is uncertain where she and the father may be residing in the future. 3) The father is currently residing in an apartment in Alberta with his father. His current residence is two and one-half blocks from the nearest school. During the course of their relationship, the mother would often telephone the police, the RCMP, the Alberta Police Service, the Department of Community Resources and Employment (DCRE) and the Alberta Health Services. The father currently works seven days a week. During this time, he has been living in the apartment with his mother and attending classes at SIAST. The mother has recently moved from Moose Jaw to Alberta. She is currently working seven days week and plans to move to Calgary in the fall. 4) The parents have agreed that Hayley will be their child's primary caretaker. Their intention is to have the child live with them for the duration of her life so that she can get used to living with her mother. Their current circumstances are complicated by the fact that each party has chosen to move from their Moose Jaw residence to a different city."

The father applied for an order pursuant to the Children's Law Act s.29(1)(a) finding the mother in contempt of court for deliberately disobeying the terms of the August 15, 2002 access order. He sought a fine and an order that she bring the child to Saskatoon for access visits. He applied to vary the terms of the access order. The Court raised jurisdiction, service and time issues.HELD: 1)To avoid adjournment counsel consented to the court's jurisdiction, the acknowledgement of service and the abridgement of time. 2)The mother was found to be in contempt of court for deliberately disobeying the order by repeatedly refusing, without lawful excuse, to comply with its terms. Almost without exception she refused to make the child available for the bi-weekly supervised access visits. She did not abduct the child. The mother was to purge her contempt by paying the father's solicitor and client costs respecting the two applications fixed at $1,500 and by obeying the access terms of this order. The August 15, 2002 order was vacated. 3)The father was to have unsupervised access on alternate weekends. He may bring the child to Saskatchewan but shall not remove her from this province or Manitoba without the mother's written consent. The father shall bear the costs of access with partial reimbursement in the amount of $60 per month, which may be deducted from ongoing child support. He shall give at least seven days notice if he is unable to exercise access. The mother shall have reasonable telephone access.","FIAT The petitioner father applied for an order pursuant to s. 29(1)(a) of The Children's Law Act finding the respondent in contempt of court for deliberately disobeying the terms of an August 2002 access order. She sought to restrict access visits to supervised visits in Manitoba. HELD: The respondent was found to be in contempt and ordered to pay solicitor and client costs fixed at $1,500 and by obeying the access terms of this order. The limited access proposal of the respondent was not realistic because it virtually guarantees that the petitioner and his parents will never be able to develop any relationship with his son, whom the petitioner has been supporting financially on a voluntary basis since birth. Nor was the access proposal realistic because the respondent does not have the financial ability to bring the child to Saskatoon for access visits. She continued to be held in contempt when she moved with the child without prior notice to the petitioner. The respondent did not abduct the child. The Court was satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt that the respondent deliberately disobeyed the court order by repeatedly refusing without lawful excuse to comply with terms of the order. Almost without exception, she refused to make the child available for the supervised access visits that were ordered every two weeks over a four-month period from August to December 2002. She purported to terminate access and refused to return the child for the remainder of the visits that had been ordered. The petitioner was not abducted. A fine was not called for in the circumstances."
7_1994canlii4892.txt,"The wife petitioned and the husband counter-petitioned for a division of matrimonial property, custody, access and spousal and child support. HELD: 1)The matrimonial property was valued and divided equally. The wife was permitted to register a caveat to protect the value of her 1/2 interest. If the husband did not arrange payment by September 1st next, the wife was given leave to apply for a sale. 2)The wife was given custody of the 2 children of the marriage.  The court ordered specific access for the husband. 3)The court confirmed the interim support orders made before trial in the amounts of $400.00 per month for the wife, $400.00 per month for the oldest child, and $800.00 per month for the youngest child, who was handicapped.","The issues were custody and access, child and spousal support and division of the matrimonial property. The respondent granted interim maintenance in the amount of $400 per month for the couple's two children; $800 for the respondent and $400 for the children. An application by the respondent to reduce the interim support was denied by Matheson, J.on May 11, 1993. However, the parties agreed that a kind of specified access should be put in place. An award for retroactive support and maintenance sought by the petitioner must be rejected. The farm home is 22 miles from the respondent's residence. The property is divided. The parties agree that the value of the farm property is $50,711.66 and that it was purchased in 1985 for $55,000. One half of that amount may be transferred to a prescribed R.R.S.P. for Mrs. Heshka. HELD: 1)The respondent was to pay the petitioner for her support at $400 and $800 per month and as well as $400 in monthly installments. The amount payable to the petitioner does not include the share of Terrance's share of the pension benefit in $3,887. The Saskatchewan Teachers' Superannuation Plan shall transfer the sum of $30,000 to an RRSP as may be prescribed by Jeanette. 2)The petitioner was not seeking custody of the children but required firm guidelines as to access. Upon hearing the parties' differing opinions as to whether or not Terrance should continue making the support payments, it was agreed that he would not be able to continue without an award. 3)An award for a retroactive award was rejected. There was discussion at the trial as to how it should be determined. 4)Terrance had from this date a beneficial interest created by this order, sufficient to support the registration of a caveat in the following lands. The petitioner was awarded costs on the petition and counter-petition."
2010skqb292.txt,"The plaintiff entered into a contract with the defendant for the sale of organic oats. The contract between the plaintiff and defendant stipulated that the oats were to be delivered at a stipulated moisture content. The defendant accepted the oats from the plaintiff and did not indicate any issue with the moisture content. In turn, the defendant sold the oats to a broker for shipment to Germany. When the oats arrived overseas, the German buyer rejected the oats saying they had heated and did not meet his required moisture content. The defendant refused to pay the plaintiff the amount owing under the contract and argued the plaintiff had failed to meet his contractual obligation. HELD: The contract was between the plaintiff and defendant. The defendant accepted delivery of the oats from the plaintiff and did not object to their quality. The evidence before the Court was that the defendant had no complaint with the moisture content of the oats at the time of delivery by the plaintiff. There was nothing in the contract between the plaintiff and defendant that allowed the defendant to transfer the shipping acceptance risk to the plaintiff. The resale of the oats to Germany was the defendant's responsibility and the plaintiff is not a party to the contact with the German company. The plaintiff was awarded the balance of the contract price, plus pre-judgment interests and costs.","The plaintiff, certified organic farmer, sold organic oats to the defendant who in turn sold the oats through a broker in Ontario to the ultimate destination being a miller in Germany. The German miller rejected some of the oats as having a high moisture content and refused to pay the farmer. HELD: The plaintiff was entitled to full payment of the contractual price.  1) The testimony before the court established that the contract as described above was validly entered into between Wlaswich and Bio Canada. The quality requirements of the contract had been met. 2) There was nothing in the contract with the farmer in which he was to continue to accept risk of non-acceptance or non-payment from any third party. He was an interested party in the whole transaction and no evidence was led that he had sufficient skill with respect to knowledge and use of the German language to allow proper interpretation of the documents. 3) The documents submitted by Bio Canada were not admitted into evidence.  4) The issue of whether the plaintiff fulfilled his contractual obligations to the company and thus entitled to a full payment or pre-judgment interest was of little relevance in the final conclusion.  5) The plaintiff had judgment against the defendant in the sum of $51,608. The plaintiff has claimed pre-jgment interest. There is no legal reason why Bio Canada should not have made payment of all of the sum owing to Wlwich. He is entitled to that amount taxed on a party-party basis under Schedule I(B) of the Tariff of Costs."

The defendant entered the house in the night and assaulted the complainant when she returned to pick up some clothes. Imposing a sentence of two years eight months, plus a ten year firearm prohibition, that this offence could be categorized as a major sexual assault. The principles of sentencing and the impact on the victim, especially in view of the fact that she was his common-law spouse, made this sentence fit.","The accused was convicted of sexually assaulting his common-law spouse. The offence was contrary to s. 271(1) of the Criminal Code. A jury had found the accused guilty of sexual assault on the wife, whom they had separated days prior. The accused had previously entered the home of a stranger and raped her, despite her struggles to get out of it. She had recently filed a victim impact statement and indicated that she did not wish to return to her father's home. HELD: A fit and proper sentence for the crime, taking into account the circumstances of the offence and the requirements of denunciation and deterrence, was a period of incarceration of 2 years and 8 months, the total being 30 months. Under s.100(1), the criminal Code, the accused was prohibited from possessing or possessing firearms for 10 years.  1)With regard to the sentencing issue, consider that this was not a stolen romantic moment with hesitant partner, but a violent assaultive act, the effects of which will stay with the victim for years and the sad example for your daughter. 2)Given the high profile of the accused's family and the fact that he had a child, the court decided to impose a victim fine surcharge."
d_2013skca22.txt,"The prospective appellant applied to leave to appeal an order made in Chambers. The Merchant Law Group and the Crown had been involved in protracted negotiations regarding the manner in which Merchant would bill the Crown for legal fees regarding their representation of Indian residential school claimants. The parties eventually reached a 'Verification Agreement', respecting the verification of Merchant's legal fees and disbursements. In order to protect solicitor-client privilege, Merchant's software company was able to develop redacted electronic billing records with the privileged information removed. When Merchant did submit a bill, it was discovered that the electronic billing records were inaccurate. The parties then became involved in a dispute regarding the Merchant's obligations under the Agreement. They had each made an application to a Chambers judge acting in his capacity as an administrative judge for the purposes of the Agreement for directions. The judge ordered (see: 2012 SKQB 517) that Merchant should contact its former software company and arrange for them to re-create the redacted electronic billing records as a whole from the 'live data' in the appellant's present billing program. Before the software company would perform this task, the Court ordered Merchant to pay the outstanding fees. Merchant had disputed these fees and had refused to pay them. Merchant took the position that the administrative judge had exceeded his jurisdiction by requiring the law firm to make this payment: the judge had over-reached his authority. In addition, the judge had based his decision on emails that were not evidence.HELD: The Court noted that leave to appeal under Court of Appeal Rule 11 is granted in accordance with the criteria established in Rothmans, Benson &amp; Hedges Inc. v. Saskatchewan. Leave to appeal was denied. The order appealed from was simply a discretionary order designed to move the verification process along and ensure the process met its overall objective of determining if the amount of Merchant's fee was reasonable and equitable. The prospective appellant failed to establish that there was a matter of sufficient importance to the proceedings or to the field of practice, the state of law or the administration of justice to warrant a determination by the Court.","The appellant seeks leave to appeal an order by the Chambers judge acting in his capacity as an Administrative Judge appointed pursuant to the Court Administration Protocol (CAP) established as part of the settlement of the Indian Residential Schools litigation. The parties are disputing MLG's obligations under the CAP and each has made an application to the Administrative Judge for directions for directions. The appellant argues the CAP was a discretionary order designed to move the verification process along and ensure the process meets its overall objective of determining if the amount of MLG's fee is reasonable and equitable. The Administrative Judge made no error in requiring the applicant to supply the redacted electronic billing records as whole from the 'live data' for the residential schools litigation. Both parties relied on hearsay evidence and an application for directions is simply an informal procedural step to ensure the Verification process moves along. Any allegations of delay by the appellant are simply unfounded and in applying the test for the granting of leave, the Court of Appeal will look at the reasons for the impugned order. HELD: Leave to appeal is denied. The order appealed from was simply a determination of the CAP process procedural in nature and each of the grounds of MLG is bound to fail. An appeal will unduly delay the proceedings and will unnecessarily add to the cost of proceedings. MLG has failed to establish that there is a matter of sufficient importance to the proceedings before the Court, to the field of practice or the state of law, or to the administration of justice generally to warrant a determination by the Court. MLG's appeal will be allowed in its usual fashion and the leave application will have its costs in the usual manner."

Allowing the appeal in part, that the Chambers judge erred when he concluded that all questions of law, including questions where the law is clear, should not be brought before the court in an application to strike, when he concluded that the constitutional question posed by the respondent had not yet been answered by the courts, and when he determined that the extent of the immunity of the appellant Board and its members, except for the Chair, was unclear.

The appellant states that the actions of the Board and of the personal defendants who participated in the decisions leading to these actions were an attempt to stonewall the plaintiff from uncovering and making public that the principal of the plaintiff and that he was alleged to have an anti-union attitude. The appellants subsequently brought an application for certiorari to the Supreme Court to quash the Board's orders and its decision to refuse leave to apply for reconsideration. The Chambers judge dismissed the application for leave to appeal. Dismissing the appeal, that the issue of Crown immunity as disclosing no reasonable cause of action, was not a matter of multifarious proceedings, at least not to the extent of being frivolous and vexatious, and all appear to be sincerely designed to seek redress of alleged wrongs."
c_2000canlii19597.txt,"The accused was charged with uttering threats to his 77 year old mother to cause death to her and his brothers contrary to s.264.1 of the Criminal Code. HELD: The accused was found guilty. 1)The words spoken by the accused were clearly meant to be taken seriously and implied menace to the listeners. The accused's evidence was disbelieved. His constructed story did not 'hang together'.  2) In a non-jury trial there is ordinarily no need for defence to formally make a Corbett application, requesting an order excluding evidence of convictions whose prejudicial effect outweighs their probative value. The judge must not infer from the record that the accused has a propensity to commit criminal offences. Given the age of the record and other factors considered including his present work and family life, it was concluded that all of the prior convictions should be disregarded as they relate to the accused's credibility. The only conclusion drawn was that the accused had been familiar with the workings of the criminal justice system which was not a negative inference.","The accused was charged with knowingly uttering a threat to cause death to his three children contrary to s. 264.1 of the Criminal Code. The accused had lived on a farm for 64 years and had a very bitter family fight. One of the children had recently passed away and the family fight had developed over dealings with and entitlement to the estate. When the accused dropped in to visit his grandmother, the grandmother, who was preparing to go bowling with her friend, heard the accused say that he would blow up the farm and its occupants (who were in immediate temporal proximity) in order to make them 'kill' and 'blow them up'. The defence objected, arguing that the convictions were dated and highly prejudicial. The Court allowed the application based on s. 12 of the Canada Evidence Act and the case law. HELD: 1) It is always open to the accused to make a Corbett application and have ruling on it before electing to call evidence. In practice, it seems as if criminal records are tendered as a matter of course in non-jury trials with the assumption that a trial judge can properly ignore the prejudicial effects of the record. While none of the prior convictions should be disregarded insofar as they relate to the Accused's credibility, there was no delay in calling the police and giving statements. 2) The accused admitted that he lost it during the conversation. The common meaning of which is to completely lose control of one's emotions, actions or speech and act in an irrational, unpredictable and possibly violent manner. 3) The Court was not left in any doubt as to whether the accused took the words of the accused seriously. There would be little point in raising the application as the evidence will have to be put before the trier of fact in order for the motion anyway."
9_1994canlii7210.txt,"The defendants permitted a private building to remain on public reserve lands contrary to s. 197 of The Planning and Development Act, 1983 and the zoning bylaws of the Resort Village of Echo Bay. They contended the bylaws were inapplicable. They conceded the activities may be an offence under the provincial statute, but submitted the selective prosecution should be stayed as an abuse of the legal process, and a violation of their right to 'equal protection and equal benefit of the law without discrimination' under s. 15 of the Charter. Legislation required 10% of land intended for subdivision to be given to the province. This land was designated as 'public reserve', and its use was limited by s. 197 of The Planning and Development Act, 1983. Most public reserves were not developed by the government, but rather by cottage owners. Some cottage owners asserted the public was able to use the construction on public reserve, and allowing such access made such construction things that 'facilitate the use of the reserve as a public recreation area' under s. 197(f) and were legal. In Echo Bay, the subdivision plan created a public reserve in front of cottage lots, vested in the province on October 25, 1983. The provincial Department of Municipal Government ('Department') was to determine what fell within s. 197. The province had no policing mechanism for violations. The Department acted as if maintaining the reserves was the municipality's responsibility, even though the province held title. In August 1986, Mr. and Mrs. Taillon built a boathouse on public reserve. They did not seek permission, as their realtor said they could treat the land as part of their lot. Their neighbour Mr. Zeah complained to Mr. Brickwell, the Senior Planner of the Department. This resulted in an enquiry into if the defendant's activities violated s. 197 or the municipal zoning bylaw. On October 28, 1986, Mr. Brickwell told the mayor that Department officials inspected the site and asked council to request the Taillons remove the structure. Council advised the Department on November 24, 1986 that it was not their land or responsibility. Mr. Brickwell informed council of proposed legislative amendments that would give title and enforcement responsibilities to municipalities. In June 1989, council asked Mr. Fraser to produce authority to construct his boathouse and if not, they would issue a stop work order under the zoning bylaws, even though they believed they did not apply to public reserves. Council was trying to avoid future problems once they heard of the amendments. They received no response and issued an order. Mr. Fraser then contacted Mr. Brickwell who told him there were numerous violations, but enforcement was lacking. Mr. Brickwell said he did not demand the boathouse be removed because, in his view, his Department did not police public reserves. On October 21, 1989, council passed a motion to turn the prosecution of violations of s. 197 over to the RCMP. The province was the landowner and enforcer of the Act, so it was appropriate for the RCMP to assume prosecution. The RCMP declined, and Mr. Brickwell informed council his Department would not act. On January 31, 1991, an amendment to The Planning and Development Act passed which allowed municipalities to take title and passed responsibility for prosecuting offenders to local councils. Echo Bay took title on July 6, 1992. On February 21, 1991, council's solicitor requested the defendants and the Fosters to remove their boathouses by June 31, 1991. The Fosters complied, but the defendants did not. On November 16, 1991, council proceeded with the action. Although council believed the boathouses were illegal, the Taillon boathouse was assessed for property taxes. Council believed they must prosecute offenders to fulfill their duty to uphold the law, discourage further violations, and ensure public reserve lands were open for public use. The defendants believed either none or all violators should be prosecuted. Council stated it was wiser to prosecute only boathouses to obtain the court's opinion. If council was correct, it may not be necessary to prosecute others because they might comply with the law as expressed by the court. If the court did not agree, council should not incur any further expense. Council asserted prosecution of boathouse owners was appropriate as boathouses caused the complaint, and they were clearly private. The defendants view their selection for prosecution out of a numerous violators as unfair and discriminatory within the prohibition of s. 15 of the Charter. HELD: A municipality may further restrict uses of reserve land, but it cannot allow uses not permitted by s. 197. Taxing the boathouse was immaterial and did not imply approval. The defendants were not misled as to their legal rights by a person in authority. The Taillons could not have believed the opinion of the realtor; they knew they did not own the land. Mr. Brickwell's comment that there were numerous violations being ignored could not be taken to mean the defendants were able to build on public reserve. It was an opinion that they might escape prosecution. The case turned on whether it was an abuse of the legal process to prosecute the defendants when other violators were ignored or a case of violating their rights under s. 15 of the Charter. How unfair it was depended on how many violators were overlooked which turned on the reading of s. 197. John Nanson, the Principal Planner of the Community Planning Services Branch, believed things on public reserve available to the public were not violations of s. 197. The court did not accept this view as it allowed citizens to determine what constituted a 'public facility' and required council to launch civil actions to remove private construction. If this was intended, no offence would be created in the first place, and the titleholder would just be left with civil remedies. An interpretation which allowed private citizens to effectively turn public reserve into private land defeated the legislation's objective. The fact that the titleholder was the province or a municipality and the use of the word public indicated the legislature wanted the government authority to decide what constituted a public facility. It cannot be public unless it was authorized or actually built by the government authority and was open for public use at all times. If the legislation was interpreted as Mr. Nanson suggested, then there were fewer violators. This made council's decision to prosecute only boathouses less unfair, and it did not give the defendants a defence as the boathouses were not open for public use. They constructed a private building on public reserve contrary to s. 197, therefore the boathouses were illegal under s. 221(1)(a)(ii) of the Act. The defendants were guilty unless prosecution was stayed as an abuse of process or because it violated s. 15 of the Charter. Council prosecuted defendants whom they saw as committing clear violations. To prosecute all violators initially would add expense at no benefit. A decision on boathouses was likely to lead to the desired clarification of the law. They had a complaint upon which they had a duty to act and wanted a test case to determine the legal position. Selective prosecution, per se, is not an abuse of process; rather it depends on the circumstances. The defendants must show they were singled out unfairly, not just that they were singled out. There was no such evidence. Stopping prosecutions for abuse of process is a power only to be used in the 'clearest of cases' (R. v. Keyowski). The defence must show that proceeding exceeds 'the limits of the community sense of fair play' and the administration of justice is best served by stopping the prosecution. In R. v. Rourke, the SCC said there was no general discretion to stay proceedings because they were considered 'oppressive'. In R. v. Jewitt, the SCC adopted the test from R. v. Young that 'there is a residual discretion in a trial judge to stay proceedings where compelling an accused to stand trial would violate those fundamental principles of justice which underlie the community's sense of fair play and decency, and to prevent the abuse of court's process through oppressive or vexatious proceedings'. Picking out defendants to prosecute from a pool of offenders to ascertain the legal position of the parties because one of their group has been the subject of a complaint did not violate 'the community sense of fair play and decency'. The defence relied on Regina v. Miles of Music Ltd. where the court said that 'no cause can fall within the category of the Ã¦clearest of cases' unless it can be fairly said that the cause of the apparent unfairness complained of can be Ã attributed to either the police or the Crown or both'. The defence said council not only did not prosecute, but did not investigate whether others were in violation. The court acknowledged this was so, but accepted the motivation was that council believed Mr. Nanson, and they did not currently intend to prosecute all violators. The defendant's real complaint was the decision to only prosecute boathouse owners. Council was trying to ascertain the law, so they could fulfill their duty to uphold it. The court found council proceeded against the defendants because it seemed sensible and financially responsible to do so, not because of any male fides. The municipal bylaws were not applicable to public reserves, but it made sense to seek the court's opinion on their applicability since council was going ahead with the action. The fact that one count was laid under the bylaws did not violate the community sense of fair play, but if it did, this would mean that count should be stayed. Council rightly attempted to get others to prosecute which caused a reasonable delay and did not prejudice the defendants. Any unsatisfactory delay was caused by the Department and not council. The Charter gives a right to a trial within a reasonable time, but this applies after a charge is laid. The delay by the province occurred pre-charge. There was no unreasonable post-charge delay or abuse of the legal process. Section 15 of the Charter is not limited to the enumerated types of discrimination, but it does not prohibit all discrimination. It must be commonly accepted discrimination abhorrent to the basic principles of society with no reason that justifies a breach of such principles. It was not discrimination contrary to s. 15 to select individuals to prosecute as a test case where it was not done for improper reasons.  'Equal protection and equal benefit of the law' did not mean one was entitled to have prosecution stopped until all violators were prosecuted. Picking out boathouse builders was not an example of discrimination prohibited by s. 15. The defence argued the law was not allowed to have unequal impact because of irrelevant circumstances (Law Society of British Columbia v. Andrews). This case should not be read so broadly. In the court's view, the proceedings should not be stayed because there was no violation of s. 15, and if the court was wrong, it was not 'appropriate and just' that such a remedy be granted, as required for relief under s. 24 of the Charter.","The defendants were charged with permitting a private building or facility, to remain on public reserve lands contrary to both the provisions of s197 of the Planning and Development Act and the Zoning Bylaws of the Resort Village.  They claimed the bylaws of the resort Village were inapplicable and that, although their activities may constitute an offence under the provincial statute, the prosecution of it should be stayed as an abuse of the legal process, and a violation of their rights to be afforded 'equal protection and equal benefit of the law without discrimination' under s15 of the Charter. HELD: The charges were dismissed. 1) The municipality did not deny the existence of a boathouse on a public reserve. 2) It did not seek permission from anyone. 3) The Department took the position that the expense of maintaining the reserves was the responsibility of the municipality, despite the fact that the Province was the titleholder. 4) The Municipality stepped into that position. Moreover, it could be argued that after the enactment of the interim zoning bylaw in 1986, permission from the province had to be obtained if their zoning bylaws did apply, in law, to public reserves. 5) In some cases, however, cottage lots did go to the high water mark. 6) However, in some cases cottage lots do not go to that level. 7) In others, old cottage lots exist immediately beside newer ones which are behind public reserve which, as far as the appearances of the matter are concerned, are part of the private lot. 8) There are access walkways to such public reserves, set aside on the plan of survey, unless one is familiar with the survey. One would not be likely to realize that the public reserve existed, let alone realize how to access it from the landside without trespassing. Such a walkway would have to be under the purported authority of the provincial bylaws, which they did not really apply to. 9) In this case, the defendants were the owners of the buildings and land bearing legal description as Lot 10, Block 10, Echo Bay, Saskatchewan, Plan 83B16092. In another case, a condo lot existed immediately beside another one which was behind another one. The condo lot at Echo Bay was the subject of a conservation easement. The owner of the cottage lot complained to the municipality in 1989 that his property was being used for deck construction. When the municipality did issue a stop work order, he refused to vacate the property. The plaintiff appealed. The defendant's"
b_1995canlii6134.txt,"The Plaintiff commenced these proceedings seeking to recover damages for personal injuries alleged to have been suffered in a motor vehicle accident. The Defendants claimed that the Plaintiff's condition related to 2 pre-existing injuries. The only issue which the Court was asked to resolve was whether this accident had caused or contributed to the Plaintiff's injuries. HELD: The question posed was answered in the affirmative. While a normal healthy person might not have been injured in this low speed rear-end collision, the Court was satisfied that, because of the Plaintiff's previous injuries and poor sitting position, the collision did contribute to her current condition in a modest manner.","The 46-year-old female plaintiff sought judgment for damages she suffered as a result of the defendant's negligent operation of the motor vehicle owned by Mr. Bird. All of the elements of the plaintiff's claim had been resolved with the exception as to whether her injuries were caused by the defendants negligence. HELD: The Court held that it did not accept the expert's opinion as to causation of the damage. Based on the evidence presented, the court concluded that the defendants' negligence did not have a causal connection. The court found that the cause of the pain was pre-existing injuries and not the collision itself. The expert was not qualified to give an opinion on causation of injury in the lower back because his research appears to be limited to reviewing the McConnell, West and Szabo reports."
5_2014skpc78.txt,"Constitutional Law – Charter of Rights, Section 8Criminal Law – Sexual Touching – Child VictimThe accused was charged that she did, with a sexual purpose, invite a person under the age of 16 years to touch a part of her body contrary to s. 152 of the Criminal Code. The case involved alleged improper acts by the accused with respect to her eight-year-old son. The information regarding the alleged incident had been given by the accused’s son to her husband. The parties were separated. The husband apparently involved a child protection worker, who interviewed the child. After this RCMP were contacted. On the basis of an RCMP’s affidavit, an ITO was prepared and a search warrant obtained. During the search, the accused’s cell phone was seized and photographs were found on it. They showed the accused lying naked on a bed with her breasts and vaginal area covered and showing her son in his pajamas, holding a bottle of lotion and touching her legs, feet and stomach. Before trial, defence counsel requested that a voir dire be held for the purpose of determining whether the information to obtain the search warrant (ITO) was sufficiently defective that the warrant was invalid, thereby infringing s. 8 of the Charter and that the evidence obtained should be excluded. The ITO did not allege that the commission of sexual assault or the creation of child pornography. The search warrant though authorized a search for images of explicit sexual activity with a person under the age of 18, with emphasis on sexual organs and the anal region, which were not related to the offence alleged to have been committed and was not supported by the ITO. The warrant authorized the search and search of devices that included cameras capable of storing images or data and computers or any other electronic devices as well as conventional photographs depicting sexual activity as described above. However, the warrant to search specifically stated that the police were authorized to search for the said “things and to bring them before or some other justice”. When the search warrant was executed, about three constables and a social worker went to the accused’s home. She was in her bedroom and was very upset when advised that there would be a search of her house. She was arrested for obstruction when she objected to the police looking at a computer, taken into custody and removed from the house to a police vehicle. During the ensuing search, one officer looked through a computer, searching for pictures. He testified that he had done so as “previewing for relevancy” and had in fact, found relevant photographs. Another constable, who had not reviewed the warrant, searched the accused’s purse and found a cell phone, which was an item not included in the warrant. Other issues raised by the defence included that the information contained in the affidavit had not met the test of establishing that an offence had been committed and that misleading information had been included. The affidavit had identified that the search was for explicit sexual pictures that did not correspond to the information obtained from the child, who was the only source of information of the alleged offence. The information in the ITO came from a number of different sources, including the original complaint by the accused’s husband who was engaged in a matrimonial dispute with her. The husband had made a number of complaints against his wife in the past, none of which resulted in a conviction. The officer who swore the affidavit had not differentiated between information obtained by him and information from third party sources. The officer also set out information, including photographs, he had obtained from an Internet search that pertained to the accused as a lingerie model. The purpose of including the information was not made clear. The officer did not disclose in the ITO the detailed nature of the information disclosed by the child to the child protection worker, which would have had the potential to detract from the likelihood of an offence having been committed, such as the accused asking her son to massage her because she was sore. The child stated that he did not believe that he had been sexually abused. Furthermore, the child identified the photographer, but the police had not interviewed him. The issues before the Court were: 1) if the Warrant to Search was valid in view of the issues raised with respect to the completeness and validity of the ITO; 2) if the search of the computer conducted on the premises was legal, either because of the rules established in R. v. Vu or because of the wording of the warrant itself; and 3) if there was a breach or breaches of the Charter, should the evidence be excluded?  HELD: The Court found with respect to the issues that: 1) the ITO could not support the issue of the warrant by a justice acting judicially in considering the effect of the statements in the ITO regarding modelling and the omission of the information in the child protection worker’s report, that the husband of the accused had previously made allegations against her, the misleading statement in the ITO concerning the specific types of pictures that the officers would search for, suggesting an investigation of more serious activity not supported by the information provided. The Warrant to Search was a nullity and the search unlawful; 2) the search of the computer on the premises was illegal both in terms of its violation of the terms of the warrant and because the Supreme Court decided in Vu that a warrant must expressly grant the authority to search a computer; and 3) the evidence from the illegal search of the computer was excluded. The breach of the accused’s s. 8 Charter right was serious because of the negligence shown by the police in their investigation of the complaint, the drafting of the ITO and the execution of the warrant. The impact of the breach on the accused was serious. Her entire home was unlawfully searched as well. The effect of the search was emotional and upsetting to the accused and resulted in her arrest. The interests of society in the administration of justice will be protected because the exclusion of the evidence would not be determinative of the Crown’s case.","The accused was charged with sexual assault and invitation to sexual touching contrary to s. 152 of the Criminal Code. The Court found that the Information To Obtain Search (ITO) was sufficiently defective that the warrant was invalid, thereby infringing s. 10(b) of the Charter and that evidence obtained should be excluded. The ITO did not allege the commission of the offence, or creation of child pornography, but only of invitation to sex. The same issue was raised in R. v. Vu, which dealt with the issue of whether a justice acting judicially could have facilitated the issuance of a search warrant. In this case, the accused alleged improper acts by the accused with respect to her eight-year-old son, specifically massaging her in the nude, while an adult male took photographs of the occurrence. The search of the computer was conducted immediately and before returning any of the items to the justice, and without further authorization as is now required. The affidavit also failed to differentiate information and belief as it did not refer to the child who was the only source of information of the alleged offence. The cumulative effect of these errors was a conclusion that the ITO could not, in the form presented, support the issue in the court's opinion. The above conclusion therefore renders the warrant to Search a nullity, and the search unlawful."
b_2003skqb397.txt,"The plaintiff claims that his father intended to designate him as the sole beneficiary of a $60,000 mutual fund but that this plan was defeated by the negligence of the defendants. The defendant admitted he was aware of the deceased's intention to leave the investment to his son. The defendant entered the plaintiff's name in the beneficiary designation portions of the fund application. However, the beneficiary designation was void by virtue of the mutual fund being non-registered. The defendant gave evidence that he advised the deceased that he would have to make a specific bequest in his will. The deceased made no special designation in his will and, at his death, the investment became part of the residue of his estate and was divided between the plaintiff and his sister. HELD: The plaintiff was awarded judgment against the defendant Nordstrom for half the value of the investment at its maturity, plus pre-judgment interest and costs.  1) Nordstrom was a professional, who held himself out as possessing special skill, judgment and knowledge in financial planning. The advice and information provided to the deceased was provided in the course of the defendant's business. The defendant had a financial interest in the transaction and was cognizant of the fact that the realization of the deceased's intent to benefit the plaintiff was dependent upon there being a valid beneficiary designation. The products sold by the defendant are used as estate planning tools. The intervention of death removed any opportunity to correct the matter and, without the application of the Wilhelm principle, this financial planner would go scott free and the plaintiff would bear the loss. The 'disappointed beneficiary' principle was applicable in this case.","The plaintiff claims that the mutual fund ought never to have formed part of his father's estate. It was his Father's intention to name him as beneficiary of the fund but that this plan was defeated by the negligence of the defendants. The defendant gave notice of intention to cross-examine on the affidavits. HELD: Garry Mayer has cause of action as disappointed beneficiary and that he suffered damages as result of the defendant's negligence. He shall have judgment against the defendant for 50 percent of the value of the investment at its maturity and his costs to be taxed. The claim was also dismissed for excess probate fees paid by the estate. Given that the defendant was a chartered life underwriter and financial consultant, no evidence was led against it and the claim against it was dismissed. Although the defendant held himself out as possessing special skill, judgment and knowledge in financial planning, his completion of the beneficiary designation on the application form could do nothing but cause confusion in the plaintiff's mind. Moreover, the plaintiff failed to demonstrate that the caution or advice was in fact given and ought reasonably to have been understood by him."
b_2002skqb72.txt,"Both sought to vary the June 30, 1999 child support order under which the father was to pay monthly child support of $987 based on an income of $80,278. He ceased paying when the children did not attend school full-time. The 21 year old worked for several years before returning to his mother's home in August 2001 and commencing full-time studies. He continued to work part-time and obtained student loans and a student line of credit. The daughter resumed living with her mother in January 2002 and was attending university full-time. Both adult children were assuming responsibility for most of their education costs by taking student loans. The mother's position was the father should pay the table amount of support for both children and his proportionate share of post-secondary expenses not covered by student loans. At issue also was payment of arrears for July to December 2001. HELD: 1)The father was to pay $1,153 per month for support for the adult children for the months of September to April inclusive, pursuant to s.3(2)(a) and 3(1)(a) of the Guidelines. Based on the criteria set forth in Farden and Zaba, both children were children of the marriage as contemplated by the Act. They were involved in the reasonable pursuit of post-secondary education and neither was able to withdraw from the charge of their parents. It was appropriate to determine the obligation in accordance with s.3(2)(a). The student loans covered most direct education expenses of tuition, books and fees. The line of credit was not considered a part of the son's means available to meet his needs. The father has a reasonably substantial income ($96,300) and cannot seek to reduce or avoid a child support obligation by guaranteeing a loan, which the child will have to repay. Child support arrears for July to December 2001 for the son to a total of $2,872 were payable at a rate of $718 per month. The daughter's needs were met while attending university in Alberta.  3)While it would appear beyond debate that an adult child must make reasonable efforts to contribute to his or her support and education, it is not so clear how this is to be applied to an individual circumstance. The principles enunciated in Francis were recast in the context of s.3(2). A similar summary, albeit with respect to an application under s.4, is found in Metzner as reiterated in MacDonald. It is clear from Francis that determining inappropriateness is not a matter of the court determining what the budget ought to be and whether a Table amount exceeds that budget. To revert to such an approach is to undermine the presumptive rule and legislated objectives of predictability, consistency and efficiency. 4)The father was to pay his proportionate share (80%) of any expenses not covered within 30 days of such funds being due. If the parties were unable to work out an adjustment for any unused education tax credit, an application may be brought to court. 5)The mother was awarded her costs of the application fixed at $750.","The parties sought to vary the existing child support order. They have two children, aged 21 and 18. Under the terms of the order, the respondent was paying child support in the amount of $987 per month on the basis of an income of $80,278. The second child, aged 18, decided not to go to university that fall and the respondent ceased paying support for him. HELD: In the circumstances at hand, it would be appropriate to calculate arrears only for the support of the two children under the age of majority as they are involved in the reasonable pursuit of post-secondary education and had the ability to contribute adequately to their food, shelter and related expenses when not in attendance at school.  1) The Table amount of support for children based upon the respondent's income is $1,153 per month. This amount is not so high as toceed the generous ambit within which reasonable disagreement is possible. It is not clearly excessive given the cost of maintaining the home for the children. 2) The evidence at hand was that the children were able to obtain reasonably remunerative summertime employment that they were not dependent upon their parents during the summer months and had their ability contribute adequately when not attending school. The petitioner's direct food and shelter expenses are $18,000 per annum. The overall household expenditures are greater. 3) The respondent ought to have determined the amount to be payable by the respondent in accordance with the Table amount.  4) Although it would appear beyond debate that an adult child must make reasonable efforts to contribute to his or her own support and education, it was not so clear how this is to be applied in an individual circumstance. To revert to such an approach is to undermine the presumptive rule and the legislated objectives of predictability, consistency and efficiency. To increase the extent of the legal obligation of the parents and to rebut the operative presumption that s. 3(2)(a) is rebuttable, having regard for the actual needs of the children and their means of living. The Court was satisfied that the chamber judge misapplied s.3(2) of the Guidelines by failing to have resort to the provisions of subsection 3(1)(b). The Court of Appeal in Wright v. Wright, [1996] held that determining inappropriateness is not a matter of the court determining what the budget ought to be and whether Table amount exceeds that budget, but rather is the Court's role in determining the actual costs of raising children.

d_2010skqb349.txt,"The defendant applied for an order sealing the affidavits of two young people who were the victims of a brutal hazing assault conducted at a high school by senior students, including the plaintiffs. The defendant argued that public disclosure of the affidavits would exacerbate the harm that was done to the young people. The Leader-Post was granted leave to speak to the matter and opposed the application. HELD: Bearing in mind the efficacy of the high school grapevine, particularly in an electronic age, publication of the factual accounts of the young persons in their affidavits will not cause further harm to them. The public, including fellow students, have the right to know their version of the facts. However, other portions of the affidavits that refer to the effects of the assault on the young men and their ramifications to others should be sealed because there is a real risk of further harm to the young persons and to others.","The defendant applies for an order sealing the affidavits of two young persons. Counsel for the plaintiffs consent to the order. The defendant applies at the top of the range of protections which the Court may afford to individuals in our society and that the onus is on the applicant to establish on a continuing basis that this remedy is required. The affidavits speak to the effects of the assault on the young persons and ramifications to others. The evidence of Don Hoium, Director of Education and former educational psychologist, brings home the point that if the evidence of the Children were to be made public, it may provoke harassment and acts of retaliation against the Children and their families, possibly by other students. The Court is concerned that such disclosure would put both the physical and psychological well-being of the Students and their Families at further risk. HELD: 1) The Court refers to Dagenais v.

c_1998canlii14016.txt,"The defendants sought to set aside a default judgment and have the plaintiff's claim struck out. The defendants abandoned their alternate claim to be granted leave to file a statement of defence. The defendants, carrying on business as a hauling sub-contractor to Tri-Link, reported a cheque drawn on the plaintiff bank as lost. Tri-Link issued a replacement cheque. The first cheque was certified at a bank branch of the plaintiff in Alberta and deposited to the defendants' credit union account. Default judgments were obtained in January/March 1997 against the defendants who now sought to have them set aside pursuant to Queen's Bench Rules 346 and 173(a). The defendants claimed the statement of claim disclosed no cause of action as a certified cheque is irrevocable and as such any default judgment may be set aside ex debito justitiae, in which case delay in bringing the application is not factor. The plaintiff claims it has a cause of action in either conversion or mistake of fact/unjust enrichment. HELD: The defendants' motion was dismissed as the plaintiff's statement of claim adequately disclosed a cause of action in mistake of fact/unjust enrichment.  1)There are exceptions to the irrevocable nature of a certified cheque. The present case is one of those circumstances where the bank has an action in restitution against the holder of a certified cheque as payment did not satisfy a just debt. The defendants in this instance had already deposited the replacement cheque when the original cheque was presented for certification and subsequently deposited by the defendants. The cerified cheque did not satisfy a just debt. The defendants had already received payment for their services.  2)In recognizing exceptions to the irrevocable nature of certification the commercial utility of certification at the request of the payee is maintained while providing recourse to a bank where a payee seeks to unjustly enrich itself and then purport to seek refuge behind the 'irrevocable nature' of a certified cheque.","The defendants sought to set aside a default judgment entered by the plaintiff against them and have the plaintiff's claim struck out.

The present case is one of those circumstances where the bank has an action in restitution against the holder of certified cheque as payment did not satisfy just debt. The defendant in this instance had already deposited the replacement cheque when the original cheque was presented for certification and subsequently deposited by the defendants. The plaintiff sought judgment against the defendants in the amount of $18,442.39 plus interest. Default judgment was taken out January 13, 1997. In considering an application under Rule 173(a) the court may only look at the notice of motion, the attached statement of claim, and any document which is referred to in the statementof claim upon which the plaintiff must rely for the establishment of the claim. The court must assume that all the allegations in the defendant's statement of claims are true, and so assume, that such allegations are sufficient to disclose a cause of action in mistake of fact/unjust enrichment. Here the defendants gave no consideration for the payment and the claim cannot be defeated."

The appellant sought declaratory relief or relief under s. 24(1) of the Charter. Dismissing the appeal that (1) the Charter has no application to this self-regulating body; (2) the panel was properly constituted in accordance with the respondent's by-laws; (3) the panel acted within its jurisdiction; (4) there was no evidence of bad faith on the part of the panel members; (5) the panel complied with the rules of natural justice, and (6) the trial judge, in refusing to grant certiorari, made no errors in so concluding.","An appeal from a refusal of certiorari or other relief on review of decision of a disciplinary tribunal of Investment Dealers Association.

In finding Ripley guilty on charges (v) of conduct unbecoming a senior officer of an investment dealer and (vi) of breach of a by-law (c) which establishes disciplinary jurisdiction for engaging in any business conduct which is contrary to the rules of natural justice (including bias), the panel found that Ripley was effectively conducting business within business for his personal profit. He defamed his employer by promoting securities which had not been properly vetted by personnel of the company. Ripley could not have corrected decisively and quickly situations of non-compliance, such as Eric Hicks involvement with outside deals, had he not done so."
d_2006skqb35.txt,"FIAT: The plaintiffs apply for an order requiring the defendant doctor to answer the interrogatories and attend a further examination for discovery. The defendants seek an order striking portions of the statement of claim, and requiring the plaintiff to provide answers to undertakings given at his examination for discovery. HELD: 1) Rule 222 of The Queen's Bench Rules allows a party to a proceeding without order to examine for discovery, before trial, an adverse party touching matters at issue. If the plaintiffs are in effect seeking to obtain particulars of similar fact circumstances, the prejudicial effect of such evidence far outweighs any prohibitive value. At the same time, s. 60(2) of The Medical Profession Act, 1981 protects against disclosure of information or evidence given during proceedings conducted by the College of Physicians and Surgeons. Likewise, s. 35.1 of The Saskatchewan Medical Evidence Act grants a similar privilege relating to quality assurance committees that have evaluated care given to patients in hospitals. Insofar as the interrogatories relate to patients, surgical procedures or proceedings not related to the subject litigation, they are either not relevant or privileged. Since the statement of claim has twice been amended, the court was satisfied that special circumstances exist permitting further examination for discovery and/or interrogatories. Wide latitude is permitted at this stage of the proceedings. The trial judge will be in the best position to determine the admissibility of information obtained in relation to the doctor's skills, techniques, judgment and competency. The plaintiffs are entitled to responses to specific interrogatories. If further elaboration is required, the plaintiffs may at their own expense re-examine the doctor. Such examination should not include inquiries as to other patient names, hospitals involved or details of the surgical procedures or surgeries performed.  2) Pursuant to Rule 173(a) of the Rules of Court it must be plain and obvious that the paragraphs of the statement of claim disclose no reasonable cause of action. Punitive damages are awarded in situations where the defendant's misconduct is so malicious, oppressive and high-handed that it offends the court's sense of decency. Such damages are only awarded where the combined award of general and aggravated damages are insufficient to achieve punishment and deterrence. The defendant's misconduct does not have to be an independent actionable wrong to attract punitive damages. The breach of a duty that is owed will attract an award of punitive damages. It is not the degree of negligence but the mental element that accompanies the negligence that give rise to a claim for aggravated or punitive damages. The amended statement of claim alleges the doctor failed to inform one of the plaintiff of the risks associated with the surgery leading her to believe there were no risks involved. Such negligence, if proven, could lead a trier of fact to conclude that both aggravated and punitive damages are warranted against this doctor. It would be somewhat presumptuous at this stage to conclude that it is plain and obvious that the plaintiffs do not have a cause of action for aggravated or punitive damages against the doctor. In the courts view humiliation, indignity, degradation or shame could be the consequences of the wrongful behaviour pleaded. If those emotions must be specifically pleaded, the plaintiffs can apply for a further amendment of their claim. 3) The obligations of a party to comply with undertakings given at an examination for discovery are contained in Rule 231 of The Queen's Bench Rules. To the extent that the doctor has been required to respond to interrogatories relating to his skill and training and to the extent that any further cross-examination may show defects in his competency, the plaintiff's undertaking must be answered. If the plaintiffs have further or other facts, those facts must be provided. 4) The defendants are not entitled to know or to take advantage of or receive any credit for or accounting relating to trust funds gratuitously set up for the plaintiff. However, an accounting regarding the bank records and the records produced for the Public Trustee by the Trustee for the trust fund will be complied with as it may impact on the claim by him for loss of income as a result of being required to be in attendance to provide care for the plaintiff.","HELD: The application was adjourned sine die. The court could not conclude that the aggravated and punitive damages would fail as against the remaining defendants. It would be difficult to prove that any of the defendants acted in bad faith, with deliberate or reckless disregard for the plaintiff, Lisa Dawson, or with extreme or malicious behaviour causing additional suffering or deserving of punishment. The jurisprudence in medical malpractice cases does not favour granting aggravated or punitive damages. However, special circumstances exist permitting further examination for discovery and/or interrogatories. The defendant argued that quality assurance reviews where complications occurred are all subsequent to the events of this case and irrelevant. In any event, the defendant has already been extensively examined relating to his training, experience, techniques and procedures."
e_2008skqb192.txt,"FIAT: A previous interim order detailed specific access in the period leading up to pre-trial or trial, however more than a year has passed and the matter has not even been set down for pre-trial. The petitioner seeks to increase access to the two children of the relationship and an order to address holiday periods not covered in the previous order. HELD: There shall be no change in the previously ordered access schedule.  The Court found no change in the material circumstances that would warrant a change in the petitioner's regular access schedule. Because of the petitioner's work schedule, the increased access is unlikely to result in any meaningful time with the children. The holiday access requested was in the nature of an extrapolation of the previous order and the Court ordered holiday access in such a fashion as to continue that order.","FIAT: The access issue has come before the Court twice. In February, 2007, Ryan-Froslie J. issued a fiat that specified custody and access. For the period subsequent to that, she ordered that the petitioner have access every weekend, every third weekend, and every fourth weekend from Friday at 4:00 p.m. to Tuesday at 10:00 a.m., (xiv) for two non-consecutive periods consisting of no more than five overnights each. With good reason. The fiat did not address access for the Christmas, 2007 period or the 2008 summer holiday period. The request to specify access this summer is also in the nature of an extrapolation of the previous order. HELD: 1) The court found no evidence that there had been a material change in circumstances or that altering the existing regular access schedule would be in the best interests of the children. 2) Applications to alter interim access orders are not the answer. Moving the matter quickly to pre-trial and/or trial is not the way to go. 3) The request for specific access for holiday periods in the distant future acts as a disincentive for the parties to resolve matters within a reasonable time period of time."
c_2014skqb31.txt,"Civil Procedure – Affidavits – Admissibility HELD: The Court could not locate any cases that suggested there was a duty to act fairly and in good faith by an insurance company because of an insurance policy where no claim was made against it. The Court found that it would be impossible for SMI to act fairly and in good faith to the plaintiffs and to concurrently act fairly and in good faith to the first defendants. SMI only had a duty to defend the first defendants pursuant to their policy of insurance. The Court noted the following in making its conclusion: 1) if SMI also had a duty to the plaintiffs, they could not use tactical or substantive errors of the plaintiffs to minimize their payment obligation. The insurer would not be able to vigorously defend the claim; and 2) the first defendant may be required to pay more if there was a duty by SMI to the plaintiffs. Many insurance policies have co-insurance provisions or require deductibles be paid by the insured. The Court held that the claim against SMI, and its employees and agents, had no reasonable chance of success. The Court also awarded costs against the plaintiffs for filing improper affidavit material. The improper material included information on settlement discussions.","FIAT: The real issue in this application is whether Saskatchewan Mutual Insurance Company (SMI) was in a special relationship of insurer with the plaintiffs that carried a duty of good faith and fair dealing. The plaintiffs are policy holders of SMI's policy of insurance. This policy is not an issue in the action commenced by the plaintiffs and is not relied on for coverage in respect of the claim. HELD: 1) The application to strike the claim against SMI is based on the fact that the plaintiffs policy holders are included in the defendant's coverage. 2) The Court found that a breach of the plaintiff's duty to act fairly and in good faith would require the insurer to breach the duties described above, placing the indemnity insurer in an impossible situation which would not advance the law or the public interest. 3) Each act was done by the person or persons therein alleged on behalf of themselves and their co-conspirators in furtherance of the said conspiracy to defraud. There was no allegation of an increased loss as a result of the claimed."
9_2016skpc123.txt,"HELD: The Charter application was granted. The accused was found not guilty. The court found that the accused’s s. 8 Charter rights had been breached. After applying the Grant analysis, the court decided that the breach was serious and that the unreasonable search affected the accused’s privacy, liberty and dignity because the accused did not invite the officer into her house, she was followed by the officer throughout her home and then handcuffed outside her home in full public view. The court concluded that society’s interests to be free from police interference in their own home without proper judicial authorization supported the exclusion of the evidence. Regarding the impaired driving charge, the accused was found not guilty because of insufficient evidence.","The accused was charged with impaired driving contrary to s. 255(1) and s. 253(1)(a) of the Criminal Code and with breach of s. 8 of the Charter by failing to provide a sample of her breath to enable analysis to be made by means of an approved screening device. HELD: The accused was found not guilty on all of the counts. The Court of Appeal upheld the trial judge’s conclusions that the police officer was attending to conduct a search for evidence following Evans, 1996 CanLII 248. The police officer exceeded the authority conferred by the implied licence to knock. The facts were almost identical. The accused had walked to her vehicle carrying a small child and put the child in the car seat in the backseat and drove away. The 7-11 employee went outside the store to obtain the licence plate. Constable Clements and several police officers attended to the home in full view. There was no evidence of driving at all. The officer engaged in a warrantless search that was without justification as it was with respect to a dwelling house. The officers accompanying the accused around the home and the actions outside of the house in full public view are serious. Therefore the implied invitation to knock extends no further than is required to permit 'convenient communication with the occupant of the dwelling'. The refusal to provide samples is also considered. Although the Court found the officer behaviour egregious, it did not find the Charter breach is serious."

HELD: 1) The Court will look at all of the circumstances in deciding whether to grant an application for severance.  In this case the plaintiffs should not be precluded from adducing evidence related to Walbaum's dealings with each of the applicants or required to segregate the evidence into two, three or four separate trials. Given the likelihood that the applicants will be required to attend portions of the trial in respect of the Walbaum Group in any event, severance would not necessarily result in a significant saving of time and expense.  2) The plaintiffs acknowledge that only relatively small portion of trial time (perhaps less than 1 day) will pertain to the claims against any one of the Sims, Gabriel or Dumurs. It would be unfair to require all of the applicants to participate in all of the trial when very little of it will be relevant to them.

b_1995canlii5809.txt,"FIAT An employer sought judicial review of a unanimous decision by an arbitration board ordering the reinstatement of an employee. The employee had previously been terminated and then reinstated by the mutual agreement of the union and the employer. The employee was then terminated a second time for a repeat infraction. The employer took the position that the agreement was a 'last chance' agreement and that the arbitration board was therefore required to uphold the second termination. The Board ruled that the agreement was not a 'last chance' agreement because the agreement stated on its face that a further infraction would result in 'discipline up to and including dismissal'. The Board therefore reinstated the employee but imposed a 16 month suspension, without pay. HELD: 1)On issues involving the interpretation of a collective agreement, an arbitration board's decision can only be overturned if it is patently unreasonable. If there is any evidence on the basis of which the board could have found as it did then its decision should not be interfered with, even if the Court would have come to a different conclusion on the same evidence. 2)Decisions involving the interpretation of a statute or the common law, however, are not within an arbitrator's core area of expertise and should therefore be reviewed with reference to the standard of correctness. 3)In this case, the 'mutual agreement' was subsidiary to the collective agreement and its interpretation was therefore within the core area of the arbitrators' expertise. The standard to be applied to the board's interpretation of the mutual agreement was therefore one of patent unreasonableness. 4)The employer's evidence that it had verbally advised the employee that he would be fired for any repeat infraction was rightly rejected as contravening the parol evidence rule. The board's interpretation of the mutual agreement was therefore not patently unreasonable and in fact was correct. 5)The board was also entitled to reject the employer's argument based upon the doctrine of 'culminating incident' and it did not act unreasonably in so doing.","FIAT.

The panel found that based on the respondent's agreement and the evidence presented at the hearing, the Arbitration Board was obliged to uphold the termination. The respondent took issue with the fact the Board refused to apply the doctrine of culminating incident and conclude that on the basis of the respondent grievor's employment record, the final incident justified termination of his employment. HELD: The application was dismissed with costs to the respondents. 1)The standard of judicial review applicable to decisions of a consensual arbitration board is the patently unreasonable test, absent jurisdictional or procedural fairness issues. 2)The Board's interpretation of the mutual agreement with respect to clause 10 was correct. 3)The respondent took the position that labour arbitrators are entitled to deference in applying common law principles of interpretation to the provisions of the collective agreement but not to accept that the August 14, 1993 incident amounted to a culminating incident. 4)The penalty imposed was a suspension without pay for 16 months."

August 7, 2007. The provisions of the order addressed the applicant's child and spousal support obligations. It was based upon the petitioner's then income of $48,196 and the respondent's $0. The parties agreed that, from and after his mandatory retirement, his circumstances including the substantial decrease in his income from the current level of approximately $67,000, may well constitute a material change in circumstance prompting yet another variation application at that time. HELD: The application was dismissed. The applicant was directed to immediately proceed to complete the application to split the CPP credits equally, the same to be supported by the respondent once her CPP claim was ruled upon.  1)The respondent recommenced his military career in early 2000 and served in the military at the time he authorized the Order he now seeks to vary. This is based upon Ms. Ellis-Reid's failure to obtain employment of any significance since the Order and her failure to diligently make and pursue an application for CPP disability benefits for which she may be eligible as required by the Order.  2)The applicant had no income and she suffered from at least two of the now longer list of medically disabling conditions set out in her affidavit. She continued to assert she was disabled and unable to engage in employment.

For the plaintiffs, that the Vendors and Purchasers Act can be used to establish possessory title, and the plaintiffs had succeeded in demonstrating 'open, notorious and continuous possession' of the property for over 40 years. The possibility of a claim by the Crown under the Escheats Act was ruled so remote as to be frivolous.","The vendors and their predecessors in title, namely the Bentleys and the Bentley, by open, open, and continuous possession since 1946, a period in excess of 44 years, have established a good and marketable possessory title to the lot in question. This title has been established by the required proof of possession for more than 40 years. The only person able to pinpoint the location of the missing frontage was the respondent's daughter. HELD: The application was granted. 1)The evidence submitted by the purchasers was so remote as to be frivolous and as is, therefore, not a valid objection to title. 2)The time period between 1961 and the present does not establish the 40 year period of such possession required by the Limitation of Actions Act. 3)Even if found to be true, the evidence of possession by the appellant and her successors in title did not defeat a claim by the Crown under the Escheats Act against whom such possession must be proved for a period of at least 60 years."
d_2006skpc95.txt,"The Crown has applied pursuant to s. 753 of the Criminal Code to have the accused designated a dangerous offender. There is no question that the accused was convicted of a 'serious personal injury offence' as that term is defined in s. 752 of the Code. It is also clear that the accused's predicate offence and past behaviour lead to the conclusion that the requirements set out in s. 753(1) of the Code have been met. The sole issue left for the Court to determine is whether the evidence permits the Court to find that there is a reasonable possibility of eventual control of the risk the accused poses to the community so that he could be designated a long term offender rather than a dangerous offender. This is not a case where a definite term of imprisonment would be appropriate, as was conceded by defence counsel. HELD: The accused is a dangerous offender. He is sentenced to indeterminate detention. 1) The accused does not have significant gaps in his violent offending, except for one period of about 19 months beginning August 2000. While there is a significant time period between his offences concerning T.R. (1993) and those involving P.M. (2003) there are also the other violent offences concerning women which are of concern, both with respect to MZ, which is a third example of that type of controlling, violent behaviour and the incidents concerning F.B. and S.O. which denote more explosive violent behaviour. 2) The expert evidence supports a finding that the accused is not someone who can be treated so as to reduce the risk of re-offence he presents to the community to an acceptable level.  3) Although many of the accused's offences were committed while he was under the influence of drugs or alcohol, it is doubtful that the continuous beatings which he inflicted on his domestic partners can all be attributed to violence while under the influence of substances. 4) The accused does not pose a risk to just a single person. Any woman he has contact with either through family relationships, intimate relationships, or purely social relationships is at risk of his penchant to punch or kick them in the face. Those he is involved with in a domestic situation or intimate relationship are at grave risk of his controlling, violent and torture-like abusing behaviour over a lengthy period of time. It is unlikely that restrictions in his living arrangements would be effective in preventing him from being intimately involved with women, who would be at risk. 5) The Court was of the opinion that the accused has significant psychopathic features of his personality that are so entrenched as to be impervious to change such that the sentencing principle of public protection can only be achieved by an indeterminate sentence.","The accused was convicted of aggravated assault for wounding his sister. The Crown applied pursuant to s. 753(1) of the Criminal Code to have the accused designated a dangerous offender. The defence position was that the accused should be designated a long-term offender. HELD: The Court held that the Court must now also consider whether the Crown has established beyond a reasonable doubt that the offender is 'dangerous offender' and must be sentenced to indeterminate detention. The Court referred to R. v. Johnson, 2003 SCC 46 (CanLII), where the Supreme Court of Canada decision in Johnson was based. Johnson held that in order to achieve the goal of protection of the public under the dangerous offender provisions, one has to be concerned about behaviour exhibiting the degree of violence reflected in the aggravated assaults and, to some extent, set aside the other offences. An application to have an offender declared dangerous offender can succeed without the sentencing judge being placed in a position to properly discharge these responsibilities. The court reviewed the cases that pre-dated the Johnson decision and found that the standard is not whether cure is guaranteed but whether there is a reasonable possibility of eventual control in the community. The following three issues were reviewed: 1) the Court reviewed the history of the accused's offences. It found that most of the offences were the first offences committed, but that the predicate offence was the most serious and involved violence. The accused had three previous convictions, all of which related to domestic violence; 2) an assault on his sister; and 3) other incidents of violent behaviour by the accused that occurred in the context of his daily living activities. The most serious of these offences involved stabbing his sister and he had stomped on the victim's head, stomach and groin area and kicked her when he was lying on the floor gravely injured; 3) various expert witnesses testified concerning the accused’s behaviour in relation to the predicate and predicate offences. In addition to receiving evidence concerning the expert witnesses, the Court considered whether there had been a reasonable prospect of change in the course of the offender”s life, even if he met the criteria of dangerous offender and appreciated that the essential question to be considered was whether the risk to re-offend was reasonably open to eventual control."
2_2009skqb516.txt,"In 1999 the plaintiff Bank granted the defendant, Wheatland, a credit facility of $500,000 plus an additional $20,000 in Visa Credit, all financed by means of a general security agreement pledging Wheatland's present and after acquired personal property with personal guarantees from two individuals. In April 1999 the Bank registered its security interest with the Personal Property Registry (PPR). Wheatland carried on business as a farm equipment dealer. Wheatland entered into dealership agreements with equipment suppliers (CNH). The Bank entered into a priority agreement whereby the Bank postponed its interest in favour of CNH. The issue in the present application is the Bank's priority with respect to credits for returned parts. The issues require an interpretation of the respective priority agreements between the Bank and the CNH companies. HELD: 1) The critical issue is the distinction between inventory and credits paid for by Wheatland and inventory and credits financed by CNH that Wheatland has not paid for. The objective of the contracting parties when they entered the priority agreement was that the CNH security would have priority over the Bank security as to Wheatland inventory supplied by the suppliers but not paid for by Wheatland or returned for credit. But once the supplied inventory was paid for by Wheatland, the Bank's general security on Wheatland's present and after acquired property would prevail.  2) The second issue only arises as the result of the first issue. It relates to the Receiver's right to require CNH Canada to repurchase parts inventory acquired from CNH Canada or its predecessors, notwithstanding that these parts were shipped direct to Wheatland by third party suppliers at the request of CNH. The issue arises pursuant to s. 50(14)(c) of The Agricultural Implements Act (AIA). While it is obvious that the direct ship parts are contractually excluded, the question is whether the direct shipped parts in this case were 'specially ordered' by Wheatland as stipulated in s. 50(14)(c) of the Act. The direct ship parts at issue consist of very ordinary articles such as nuts and bolts, washers, O-rings, seals, gaskets and bearings. The contractual provisions entitle CNH to refuse to restock direct ship parts. However s. 50(2) and s. 50(3) override the contrary contractual provisions in certain circumstances. It appears that the contractual arrangements were intended to enable CNH to opt out of its AIA obligations to repurchase inventory from a terminated dealer. The AIA does not permit or accommodate such opting out. The provisions of s. 50 appear to be designed to protect the supplier as well as the dealer. The Court is not persuaded that the parts in this case were in any way unique or specially ordered. They were commonplace articles of personal property required by a farm machinery dealer for its use and for use by its retail customers.","PricewaterhouseCoopers, receiver and manager of Wheatland Industries (1990) Ltd. (the plaintiff) carried on business as a farm equipment dealer at separate locations in Rosetown, Saskatchewan and Elrose, Saskatchewan. Wheatland entered dealership agreements with equipment suppliers, including New Holland Canada (which was part of CNH Canada) and Flexi-Coil Ltd. The dealerships granted the plaintiff lines of credit on the security of present and after-acquired product inventory. At issue was whether the three suppliers were obliged to pay certain amounts to the plaintiff for restocking purposes. HELD: 1)The contractual provisions clearly entitle the plaintiff to refuse to restock direct ship parts. However, ss. 50(2) and (3) serve to override the contrary contractual provisions in certain circumstances. 2)The word 'goods' must be interpreted to include 'parts' which in common English language usage would surely be the case. See that as the essential intent of the contracting parties and the impact of the agreement. 3)The plaintiff was acting on behalf of all creditors to determine priority between competing claimants. That is not the same as the Receiver seeking to change the priorities as between the respective claimants. Parts and service manuals returned by the receiver to CNH are to be read and construed as part of the priority agreement. There is no dispute that parts and supplies are not 'Goods' or 'inventory' for the purposes of the trade. The relationship between the vendors and the plaintiff was one of importance. 4)The issues relate only to the interpretation of the respective priority agreements between the TD and the CNH companies and to their interpretation of s.50(14) of the Agricultural Implements Act. There may be a similar agreement involving Flexi‑Coil but it has not been provided. 5)The parties object to the propriety of a court-appointed receiver taking the side of a competing creditor in a priority dispute amongst creditors. In the context in which the issue has arisen here, this is a collateral matter which has no impact on the outcome, except as to costs. 6)The receiver, as an officer of the Court, has filed a report outlining the background facts in detail. There are no facts in dispute. 7)It is not in dispute that the parties stand as successors to the respective contracting parties, and have assumed their respective rights and obligations relating to the TD priority agreements. 8)The recitals in issue refer to new goods, used goods and trade-in goods."

In 1997, the plaintiffs first learned through other family members that the defendant, a nephew of the deceased, had revealed to them that it was actually he who was the driver of the car at the time of the accident. They brought an action under the provisions of the Fatal Injuries Act. This was an application to disallow the limitation defence raised by Judgment Recovery on behalf of the defendant. Dismissing the application without costs, that the limitation as prescribed by the Act is twelve months, which the plaintiffs had clearly exceeded. This time period is without regard to the injured party's knowledge of whether or not a claim exists.","This was an application for an order disallowing the limitation defence raised by Judgment Recovery on behalf of the defendant, Howard LeLacheur, pursuant to s. 10 of the Fatal Injuries Act. The plaintiffs were living in Alberta at the time of the 1972 motor vehicle accident and alleged that they had been the driver when the accident took place. The action was commenced 25 years later. At issue was whether the limitation period should begin to run until February 1997, the date upon which they learned for the first time that Howard was the driver of the vehicle 25 years earlier. HELD: The application to disallow the defence was dismissed. The Court declined to award costs to Judgment Recovery. 1)The plaintiff had made no inquiries to the defendant or the police as to how the accident happened. She could have asked him her father's name several times but for some reason did not do so. When time runs from the 'accrual of the cause of action' or from some other event which can be construed as occurring only when the injured party has knowledge of the injuries sustained, the Judge-made discoverability rule may not extend the period the Legislature has prescribed. 2)There was no sufficient evidentiary basis upon which the Court could make a finding of fraudulent concealment on the part of the plaintiff."
c_1998canlii13533.txt,"FIAT. An application to vary maintenance for two children under the Federal Child Supprt Guidelines. At issue were the determination of the father's income and whether the expenses of the eldest child attending Grade 12 in Manitoba constituted extaordinary expenses for secondary school education pursuant to s7(1)(d). The father's reduced farm income was explained as due to poor crop yields. He anticipated being laid off from his work at the mine in October. He claimed significant vehicle expenses for his travel to work. The mother contested many of his expenses as being overstated. HELD: The respondent's child support obligation was $347 per month. 1)It was fair and reasonable to take an average of the 1997 and projected 1998 income. The preceeding years were not significant because the father's current income at the mine commenced in May 1997. Travelling expenses would not be considered in the absence of the accounting advice to explain the basis for the deduction and to establish the actual amount and where no deduction has been made in the past. No explanation was offered for why the claims for gas and repairs were significantly higher than in previous years. The capital payments for land and machinery and the costs of the stepchild's horse were excluded. In the circumstances the acquisition of equipment and capital cost allowance, in lieu of renting, was not patently unreasonable. The farm income was adjusted in 1997 and 1998 by adding back 25 percent of the capital cost allowance for the new truck. The acquisition of a $43,000 vehicle was an extravagance given his income bracket and his obligation to support his children. His allocation of one-half its cost to farming was questionable given the distances tavelled during his employment at the mine. 2)There was no evidence why the child attended high school in Manitoba, why the expense was necessary in relation to the child's best interest and whether the child had any means to contribute. Leave was given to return the matter to the Court with the appropriate supporting materials.  3)No order as to costs.","FIAT.

c_2013skpc94.txt,"A Child and Family Services agency applied for an order: 1) declaring that the foster parents of three children have sufficient interest pursuant to s. 23 of The Child and Family Services Act; and 2) granting the foster parents custody pursuant to s. 37(1)(b). The children's mother was deceased and their father indicated that he was unable to meet his children's needs. The foster parents intended to continue to allow the father parenting time with the children. They also indicated that they would care for the children until each is 18 or until the order was terminated. The father consented to a draft order agreeing the children should be in the custody of the Minister and that he have reasonable access. The agency amended their application for the custody order to be made in favour of the foster parents rather than the Minister. HELD: The children were in need of protection pursuant to s. 11(b). The Court found that the agency's amended application was appropriate and preferred to a temporary order in favour of the Minister. Also, the Court noted that s. 39 allows for amendments of orders if circumstances change. The Court, therefore, ordered that the foster parents have custody even though the father only indicated his consent to the order in favour of the Minister. The agency was required to ensure that a copy of the written decision was personally served on the father.","The agency initially applied for a long term order under s.37(3) of the Child and Family Services Act (the Act) but then amended its application to now apply for an order that the current foster parents be declared as persons having a sufficient interest in all three children (under s. 23 of the Act and s. 37(1)(b)) and an order granting them custody. Should the amended application be granted? HELD: Each child in need of protection pursuant to s.11(b) is ordered to be placed in the custody of the person of sufficient interest, which effectively means they can return to their parent, placed with a person of adequate interest, in the event circumstances change. The Agency will make the orders requested. Each child is identified by initials for the purposes of protecting their identity."
4_2005skqb265.txt,"The respondent applies to vary his 1992 divorce judgment to fix support for his oldest son, who resides with him, retroactive to August 2004 and to terminate the payment to his former spouse for him. In March 2005, this Court made an order fixing the parties incomes and providing for ongoing support for this son of $129 per month. The sole issue is whether these orders should be made retroactive. HELD: It is fair and equitable to terminate the respondent's obligation to pay $670 per month for the oldest son effective August 2004 and to make the petitioner's support payments for him retroactive to that date.  1) This Court favours an approach to retroactive child support that leaves the decision to the discretion of the Court. In exercising that discretion, the Court must keep in mind the objectives of the Guidelines and take into consideration the circumstances of each individual case. 2) The Court must consider whether the application is interim or final, the objectives of the Guidelines, the same factors should apply to retroactive orders whether they increase or decrease child support and whether they are pursuant to federal or provincial legislation, and the individual facts of each case must be considered to ensure that parents are jointly responsible for the support of their children and the principles of fairness and equity are met. If the Court decides to order retroactive support then, pursuant to s. 15(6.1) of the Divorce Act, it must do so in accordance with the Guidelines. 3) By February 2004, the respondent had written to the petitioner, putting her on notice that he wanted the payment to terminate because the oldest son was residing with him. The petitioner refused even though the son had very little contact with her. There was no justification for the payment to continue. It is difficult to understand her failure to provide support for this son while at the same time insisting on the continuation of the respondent's payment for that same son, who was spending no time with her.","FIAT: The respondent applies to vary his February 28, 1992 divorce judgment to fix support for his oldest son, who resides with him, retroactive to August 1, 2004 and to terminate the payment to his former spouse for August 2004. The issue of whether these orders should be made retroactive was reserved. HELD: 1) The Court has jurisdiction to vary support orders pursuant to the Divorce Act. In L.S. v. E.P., the Court held that the circumstances leading to the child support award had not changed. The parties' incomes were similar to what they had been in 1992 and the children continued to spend a substantial portion of their time with their mother. 2) Retroactive support is not the same as ongoing support in that the period of time to which it applies has passed and the resources needed for its payment may no longer be available. The Alberta Court of Appeal disagreed with many of the factors on this issue. It adopted the reasoning in Henry v. Henry, 2004 CanLII 34381 (ON C.A.), which held that there is a presumption in favour of retroactive support (i.e. that it is reasonable and consistent with the obligations of child support that payor be required to pay) and that the Court is always free to intervene and determine the appropriate level of support for children."
2_2010skqb444.txt,"The accused was charged under s. 5(2) of the Controlled Drugs and Substances Act after a highway traffic stop in which the accused was driving a motorhome that was found to be modified to carry cocaine and marijuana by a group of officers designated to search for drugs in vehicles. The cocaine found in the motorhome had an estimated street value of between 1.1 and 2.5 million dollars. The marijuana had an estimated street value between $471,000 and $733,000. The officer who stopped the motorhome saw it weave from the centre line to the fog line approximately six times. The officer testified that he suspected the driver might be impaired by alcohol. The officer stopped the vehicle and found no indicia of impairment by alcohol. The officer ran the motorhome on his computer system and found that it was registered to the driver. Another officer arrived on scene and approached the motorhome. The second officer noted a smell of fabric softener in the vehicle and testified that the accused appeared unusually nervous. The second officer testified that fabric sheets are frequently used to mask the odour of drugs. The second officer testified that he suspected the Vehicle Identification number on the dash had been tampered with because the rivets looked too new. He testified that he compared the Vehicle Identification Number on the dash to the number on the door and found they did not match. He later acknowledged that he was in error and later discovered that the numbers did match. The second officer commenced a search of the vehicle purportedly to search for paperwork that would confirm that the vehicle was not stolen. The accused was arrested for possession of stolen property. As the officer searched the vehicle, he noted signs that it had been modified. A drug sniffer dog was brought to the scene and had a positive reaction near the rear vent of the motorhome. The officers conducted a search of the vehicle which revealed that the motorhome hnd been significantly modified for the purpose of transporting illegal drugs. The accused was arrested for trafficking. The accused advised the officers that he wanted to contact a lawyer after he was arrested for trafficking. Another officer attended the scene to transport the accused to the detachment. That officer assisted with the search of the motorhome for approximately half an hour before driving the accused another hour and a half to the detachment where he was allowed to contact a lawyer. The accused argued that his rights under ss. 8, 9 and 10 of the Charter were infringed and sought exclusion under s. 24(2). HELD: Section 8 Ã» The motorhome had been extensively modified for the purpose of carrying contraband and could no longer be used as a motor home because its domestic systems had been disabled. The accused was entitled to no greater expectation of privacy in the vehicle than he would have had in any other passenger vehicle that he had the ability to regulate access to. The officers did not have a reasonable suspicion that the motorhome was stolen. The real purpose of the detention and arrest for possession of stolen property was to search the vehicle for drugs. The observations of the second officer on scene to support his reasonable suspicion that the motorhome was stolen were not capable of verification. He chose not to look at or consider the available information indicating the vehicle was not stolen including: the valid registration presented by the accused and the information from the CPIC query. Virtually all of the other observations of this officer had little to do with the possibility of a stolen vehicle and were indicators of a vehicle suspected of carrying contraband. In conducting the search, the officers were acting on little more than a hunch based on intuition. The search of the motorhome incidental to the accused's arrest for possession of stolen property amounted to a breach of s. 8. By the time the sniffer dog was deployed, the police had a reasonable suspicion that the accused was transporting drugs. However, the search of the motorhome and observations of its modifications were incidental to the arbitrary arrest of the accused for possession of stolen property, therefore, their grounds for the reasonable suspicion did not support the deployment of the sniffer dog. Section 9 Ã»  The arresting officer did not have reasonable and probable grounds to believe the motor home had been stolen when he arrested the accused. He had not carried out even a cursory investigation into the possibility that it might have been stolen. His inability to compare the two vehicle identification numbers accurately was willful blindness or flagrantly negligent. The accused was arbitrarily detained when he was arrested for possession of stolen property. The observations that lead to the reasonable and probable grounds to arrest the accused for trafficking were derived from his arbitrary arrest for possession of stolen property. The detention had little practical effect on the accused because he remained confined to the back of the police car as a result of the earlier arrest for possession of stolen property. Section 10 Ã»  The accused was not provided with an opportunity to retain and instruct counsel in a timely fashion. However, the police did not attempt to elicit any incriminating evidence from the accused during the time it took to get him to the detachment to call a lawyer. There is no causal connection between the breach of the accused's rights under s. 10(b) and the discovery of the drugs. The evidence was excluded under s. 24(2). The breaches of the accused's rights under ss. 8 and 9 were very serious. The officer was so determined to find evidence of contraband that he became blinded to the constitutional requirements of a reasonable suspicion for investigative detention and reasonable and probable grounds for arrest. His actions showed a flagrant disregard for Charter requirements. The deprivation of liberty and privacy resulting from the breaches was significant but not egregious. These two factors favor excluding the evidence. The charge is a serious one and involves a large quantity of drugs. The evidence is highly reliable and critical to the Crown's case. The truth seeking function of the Court favours admitting the evidence. On balance, the administration of justice would be brought into disrepute if the evidence was admitted and that standard is paramount.","The accused was charged with possession of cocaine and marihuana for the purpose of trafficking contrary to s. 5(2) of the Controlled Drugs and Substances Act as am. He applies for an order excluding evidence of cocaine found in his motor home on the basis that his rights under ss. 8, 9 and 10 of the Charter of Rights were violated. This decision follows voir dire held to determine the admissibility of the evidence. HELD: The evidence must be excluded. 1) The accused was unusually nervous. He asserted that he was looking for any additional labels, paint colour changes or information that might confirm or refute the vehicle's true owner and identity. 2) The motor home was extensively modified to facilitate the transportation of illegal drugs. The plumbing and holding tank systems had been disabled, walls had been moved and secret compartments created, and hydraulics with switching system had been installed to provide access to the compartments. The vehicle contained 262 pounds of marijuana (worth between $471,000 and $733,000) in heat sealed plastic bags and two bundles of $3,080 worth of bills were found under a shelf in a cupboard. The RCMP officer observed the accused weaving from one end of the motor home to the other and noticed that the panel from the rear axle to the back had been painted in a flat black. He asked the accused if he was on any medication and when he had last used any liquor or narcotics. The accused stated that he did not wish to contact a lawyer. 3) The evidence was excluded from the determination of the violation of the accused's Charter rights. The Court found that the accused had a reasonable expectation of privacy in the home as he was used to checking the driver for signs of impairment or smell of alcohol to assess his level of sobriety and that his right to remain silent was violated when he was held at the roadside and 'booked in' before being given access to counsel."
4_2000skqb340.txt,"The plaintiff purchased a medical insurance policy from MSI for the time he expected to reside in the USA pursuing studies. The policy did not cover the periods he would be in Saskatchewan where he ordinarily resided with his parents. The plaintiff suffered chest pain following a water-skiing accident in August 1997 in Saskatchewan and underwent a thoracostomy for a collapsed lung while in Saskatchewan. He underwent a further thoracotomy in February 1998 while in the USA. MSI denied coverage arguing the plaintiff should have postponed the operation and returned to Saskatchewan for the surgery and that, in any event, the condition pre-existed the purchase of the insurance policy. The medical reports agreed that surgery was necessary. They also agreed it could be postponed for a time but there was disagreement over the length of any postponement or the patient's ability to travel home given the circumstance of a collapsed lung and the suspected but unconfirmed existence of a bleb. HELD: The plaintiff was awarded $26,864.46 plus costs, to be taxed. 1)The evidence that travel was dangerous and put the plaintiff's life in jeopardy was accepted. Therefore the plaintiff was unable to return to Saskatchewan for the surgery. 2)The exclusionary clause did not exempt MSI from liability for payment. The definition of a 'pre-existing condition' is not clear and does not operate to relieve MSI of its obligation under the policy to extend the benefits in question. The policy was in effect from August 1, 1997 to July 31, 1998. It was not raised in a letter confirming the dates of his coverage sent after the plaintiff had experienced the pneumothorax of which MSI had been informed.","The plaintiff purchased a medical insurance policy from the defendant, Medical Services Incorporated for the period of time he expected to reside in Chicago, Illinois, U.S.A. pursuing studies in optometry. HELD: The plaintiff was unable to return to Saskatchewan for surgery as he had a pneumothorax, collapsed lung, which he associated with the events of water-skiing. The insurance policy under review was in effect from August 1997 to July 1998. During that period, Hurd required medical attention and surgery, performed in Chicago for a condition undetected earlier by qualified medical personnel and therefore not a pre-existing condition as that term is defined in the policy. The plaintiff will have judgment for the sum of $26,864.46 prayed for together with costs to be taxed. The definition of a 'pre-existing' is not clear and does not operate to relieve MSI of its obligation to extend to Hurd the benefits for which he sues in this action. The final consideration concerns the 'effective date' of the policy referred to in the exclusionary clause. As said in opening, the policy was in affect from July 1997 to August 1998 and covered Hurd for medical services required by him while outside the province of Saskatchewan for three months. During this period, during which time, in February 1998, he required emergency medical treatment and surgery in Chicago. Hurd was unable, as he was not to drive an automobile, to remain within 15 minutes of Mercy Hospital in Chicago and he would immediately return to emergency if the symptoms became more severe. Neither of the quoted terms could be construed as relieving MSI's obligation to pay."

HELD: The appeal was allowed and the acquittals ordered by the trial judge were restored. There was no basis to overturn the findings of fact made by the trial judge. The appeal judge misinterpreted the decision of the trial judge who properly considered the issue of income before dealing with mens rea.

The charges against both accused relate to willfully evading the payment of taxes and the unlawfully making of a false or deceptive statement in the return of income. HELD: Appeal allowed. 1) The trial judge erred in failing to determine if the payments involved were income and in focussing only on the criminal intent of the accused. 2) The appeal judge misinterpreted the decision of the trial judge. He proceeded on the worst case scenario, that all payments received by the appellants constituted income and then he considered the issue of mens rea. The accounting records upon which the claim for deductions were made were, in fact, false, false thus obviating the liability for tax. The Crown did not raise this issue in its grounds of appeal to either the Summary or this Court. 3) The Crown argued the accounting records and record keeping were haphazard and sloppy. Both parties agreed the test is set out in R. v. Redpath Industries Ltd. et al. (1984), 84 D.T.C. 6349 at 6351: a criminal court is not the forum to determine income taxability and to make determinations as to rights to tax assessment or absence of rights to do so. In this case, the appeal judge was not prepared to make the determinations based on the evidence involved. 4) The retrun of the tax returns was demonstrably false and the record keeping was part of an elaborate scheme of deception to avoid taxes. It is also consistent with simple sloppiness."
2008skqb287.txt,"The eldest daughter, 15 years old, her sister, 14 years old, and their brother, 12 years old, were apprehended from their mother on 2 March 2006. The Minister sought an order pursuant to s. 37(3) of The Child and Family Services Act placing the children in the care of the Minister until each child turned the age of 18 years. The mother opposed the Minister's request for long term orders for the three children, taking the position that the children were not 'children in need of protection' pursuant to s. 11 of the Act, and that the children should be immediately returned to her care. In the alternative, the mother proposed that the court make a short term supervisory order under s. 37(1)(a) of the Act, returning the children to the mother's care under supervision and conditions. The issues were: 1) whether the children were children in need of protection pursuant to s. 11 of The Child and Family Services Act; and 2) if so, the appropriate order to be made, respecting each of the children, pursuant to s. 37 of the Act. HELD: The children are children in need of protection pursuant to s. 11(a)(i),(v), (vi) and 11(b) of the Act. There shall be an order pursuant to s. 37(3) of the Act that the children be placed in the custody of the Minister until each child attains the age of 18 years. There shall also be an order with respect to access. It is well established that child protection proceedings involve a two step process. First, there must be a determination pursuant to s. 36(1) as to whether the child is in need of protection as that term is defined in s. 11. If it is determined that a child is in need of protection the next step is to determine the appropriate order among the options contained in s. 37.The Ministry had a legitimate concern that, based on a prior conviction for assaulting the child of a previous common-law partner, the mother's common-law partner posed a risk to the children. The Ministry acted appropriately by requesting the execution of a parental services agreement (PSA) with a condition therein that her partner should not have any unsupervised time with them. The Ministry had evidence that the partner and the mother breached the terms of the PSA. They received information from the school, neighbours, the children and, importantly, the mother herself, that the partner was having unsupervised contact with the children. The Ministry then proceeded to apprehend the children in light of its concern regarding possible harm to the children at his hands. The Ministry made an appropriate determination that the children were in need of protection as a result. If the court is wrong in the determination that s. 11(a)(i) is applicable, it finds that all three children were in any event in need of protection pursuant to s. 11(v), (vi) and s. 11(b) of the Act. The Ministry had evidence that the mother was having difficulties caring for the two children with special needs. The mother's actions could have, and likely did, impair the development of the children. Further, with respect to domestic violence, the mother herself characterized her relationship with the partner as emotionally abusive. Finally, having reached conclusions that there was risk to the children, the Ministry determined that there was no other adult person able or willing to provide for the children's needs as set out in s. 11(b) of the Act. The mother argues, in addition, that the children are no longer in need of protection. Thus, the court has to determine whether there has been sufficient change since March 2006 so as to conclude that the children are no longer in need of protection and can immediately be returned to the mother's care. Unfortunately, the court cannot reach that conclusion. Indeed, the mother herself acknowledged that it would be a slow process regarding unification of the children into her home. The mother continues to object to suggestions made by the Ministry to improve her parenting abilities. Although the mother appears to have come some distance in understanding she has problems, she continues to resist recommendations for change. She continues to fight the Ministry as opposed to cooperating with it. For these reasons, and the reasons set out above, the children continue to be children in need of protection pursuant to s. 11 of the Act. The Ministry seeks an order pursuant to s. 37(3) that the three children be placed in the custody of the Minister until each child attains the age of 18 years. The mother says that a more appropriate order would be a short term supervisory order pursuant to s. 37(1)(a) of the Act. All three children love their mother and want to continue to spend time with their mother. However, they are doing extremely well in their current foster placements. In this case, the age of the three children is a critical factor. The children are now 15, 14 and 12 years old. There is not much time for the mother to take all the necessary steps she needs to take before the children are returned to her and the time the children will be reaching the age of 18 years. The Ministry has not pursued a permanent order under s. 37(2) of the Act. Indeed, the mother and the grandmother should continue to play a substantial role in the children's lives. An order pursuant to s. 37(3) of the Act, placing the children in the custody of the Minister until each child reaches the age of 18 years is the appropriate order in this case. The mother will, with a long term order, have the ability to make the necessary changes in her life and, if she does so, apply for a variation of this order in the future.","The Minister sought an order pursuant to s. 37(3) of The Child and Family Services Act placing the children in the Minister's care until each child turned the age of 18 years. The mother opposed the request for long term orders for the three children. HELD: 1) The children were apprehended from their mother S.D. (the'mother'). The mother took the position that the children are not 'children in need of protection' pursuant to S. 11 of the Act and that they should be immediately returned to her care. 2) The Minister called 18 witnesses including two experts and one mother to testify on the relevant factual matters. It is not disputed that S.T. breached the condition of the PSA allowing only supervised time with the children, but the mother was not happy to have the Ministry involved and never has been. The father of one child, who was diagnosed with attention deficit disorder, indicated he was unable to attend trial because he was ill. The other child who had been apprehended with severe lice, J.W., did not appear at trial. 3) The mother had three children, all of whom were in the care of the Minister prior to the mother's arrest. The Minister had the mother placed on apprehended status. She was ordered to have regular weekly access for the children for three times per week for a minimum of four hours. The child was to have lunch with the mother and listen to music and dance with her. 4) If the children were found to have Goldenhar Syndrome, the mother would be returned to the Minister for custody of the other child. 5) The evidence in this matter focused on the mother’s change from being hostile to the father during the arrest and detention of the children and her changing attitude towards the mother. The court reviewed the various specialists’ reports and found that the mother had changed. She would no longer put the interests of man before her children."

Dismissing the application, that ""(1) there would be a violation of an essential of justice if the grandchildren were not excluded from hearing the evidence of each other; (2) the inherent rights of the parties to attend the discovery should not be displaced by the mere assertion that 'the lines of questioning of each of the plaintiff Grandchildren will be virtually identical' and (3) there was no evidence before the Court that it would be of value to the plaintiffs in being able to assess what one another has said."

He did not defend the civil proceedings and the Plaintiff applied to have her damages assessed. The evidence in the civil trial also disclosed that the Plaintiff had be sexually assaulted by her uncle. HELD: Judgment for the Plaintiff. 1)The Plaintiff had been diagnosed as suffering from severe psychological problems as a result of the sexual assaults. 2)The Court assessed the Plaintiff's non-pecuniary damages at $50,000.00 and apportioned 80% of this sum or $40,000.00 to the step-father. 3)The Plaintiff was also awarded $25,000.00 in punitive damages as against the stepfather.","The defendant was the step-father of the plaintiff. He pleaded guilty to a criminal charge of sexually assaulting her. He was sentenced to ten months imprisonment, subsequently reduced on appeal to six months. The plaintiff commenced an action against the defendant claiming damages as a result of the sexual assaults. The defendant did not defend the action.HELD: 1)To the extent that damage awards in sexual assault cases represent non-pecuniary damages, the quantification thereof should accord with the principles articulated in J. A. Andrews. 2)The Court's subjective approach to assessing the damages must be utilized primarily with respect to her non pecuniary loss. In most personal injury cases the loss to the plaintiff is caused by the negligence of the defendant. An award of aggravated damages is rarely even considered. But when the claim is founded on sexual assault, the damage inflicted is deliberate. 3)Because the plaintiff has not had any physical basis for the pain and suffering she has undergone, the psychological trauma and emotional distress which she undergoes has been severe. She will continue to suffer to the same extent for an appreciable period of time."
c_2007skpc41.txt,"The accused was charged that he did drive while disqualified, contrary to s. 89(1) of The Highway Traffic Act, as it was then. The issues were as follows: 1) should the offence of driving while disqualified contrary to the provincial statute be regarded as a full mens rea offence? 2) is the evidence sufficiently credible for the court to conclude that the accused had knowingly operated a motor vehicle while subject to a driving disqualification? HELD: The accused is not guilty. 1) Driving while disqualified should be regarded as a full mens rea offence, rather than one of strict liability requiring the accused to establish due diligence on a balance of probabilities, given that the accused's liberty is jeopardized with the potential of incarceration. Likewise the automatic disqualification and surrender of a driver's license are serious sanctions. 2) The accused was adamant in asserting that he had no knowledge of his license suspension at the material time. Although he was not able to offer a compelling explanation for ignoring the admonition to him in a letter from Saskatchewan Government Insurance (S.G.I.) of July 11, 2005 that if he consumed any alcohol, an original driving suspension would be reinstated, the accused believed it was appropriate to rely instead on the advice of the peace officer on December 18, 2005 that it was only a 24 hour suspension, unless he heard further from S.G.I. Likewise, it did not appear that the accused had any further communication from S.G.I. subsequent to December 18, 2005, until shortly after the motor vehicle accident, roughly 2 months later. At that time, it was confirmed that the suspension had been extended to October 16, 2006, contrary to his earlier belief. Apparently it is an important part of the S.G.I. administration of driver's license suspensions that there be communication by letter, as has occurred here twice, with the purpose of attempting to ensure accused persons are advised in writing of changes in the legal status of their driving suspensions, with clarity and precision. As such, this accused should be able to rely on that procedure, even when that communication was not as timely as one would hope. Not having heard from S.G.I. in the interim, after December 18, 2005, it was reasonable for him to rely on the advice received from the peace officer. As such, the evidence is not sufficient to prove that the accused had knowingly operated a motor vehicle while disqualified as alleged, and he is not guilty.","The accused was charged with driving while disqualified contrary to s. 89(1) of the Highway Traffic Act. The alleged driving occurred when the accused was involved in a motor vehicle accident and engaged in other alleged misconduct, including driving without due care and consideration for others, and failing to identify himself to the other driver before departing from the scene. HELD: 1) It is an important part of the S.G.I. administration of driver’s license suspensions that there be communication by letter, as has occurred here twice, with the purpose of attempting to ensure accused persons are advised in writing of changes in the legal status of their driving suspensions with clarity and precision. As such, this accused should be able to rely on that procedure, even when that communication was not as timely as one would hope. 2) The evidence is not sufficient to prove that the accused had knowingly operated a vehicle while disqualified as alleged, and he is not guilty. 3) The determination of credibility does not involve the court opting for one version of events or the other. Rather, the court must prove that its evidence is credible, and there is no onus on the accused to establish a strict liability offence. The accused was acquitted of all charges."
7_1999canlii3285.txt,"The plaintiff was injured as a result of a motor vehicle accident. The defendant was found liable. At issue was the claim of the plaintiff against the defendant's insurer for Section B benefits. The defendant paid benefits for 129 weeks. It claimed that the plaintiff misrepresented her employment status at the time of the accident, and that the benefits should be re-paid. The plaintiff argued in response that the defendant was estopped from claiming repayment. Ordering the benefits be re-paid, that the defendant acted expeditiously to comply with its contractual obligation, on the basis of representations put forward on behalf of the plaintiff, to provide income replacement when the need was made apparent to it. It would be illogical to prevent the defendant from getting its money back when it is found that the benefits were paid on the basis of faulty information provided by the plaintiff. This is not a situation in which estoppel lies against the defendant.","The common law wife of the insured was injured when her car was hit from behind by the defendant's vehicle. The insurance company claimed the plaintiff had not shown that she was employed at the time of the accident. The plaintiff brought an action against the defendant and its insurer, pursuant to Schedule 'B' of the Paris insurance policy, for loss of income. She brought this action on the basis that the defendant failed to report any interest in claiming repayment of the money it had paid to her for the past 3 years. The defendant argued that this was a situation in which the plaintiff should have been able to find employment. Awarding the plaintiff $140 per week for 129 weeks, that the plaintiff would have been entitled to full-time employment if she had known that there was a possibility that she would have to pay the money back, but that she did not appear to have done so.

d_2004nsfc13.txt,"The mother was unable to care for the child and the father, who had been convicted of sexual assault, was only entitled to supervised access. Both the paternal and maternal grandmothers presented plans of care to the court, with the paternal grandmother seeking custody and the maternal grandmother seeking care and control of the child. The child had a younger sibling who was in the maternal grandmother's custody and her daughter, the mother of the child, supported the plan of the maternal grandmother. The Agency supported the paternal grandmother. Custody granted to the paternal grandmother with reasonable access to the maternal grandmother and supervised access to the parents. The paternal grandmother was better able to care for the child financially and her circumstances were such that it was in the child's best interests to grant her custody. The issue of separation of siblings was only one factor in considering an alternative (relative) placement; the children were very young and there was no evidence of a bond between them.","The mother, who lives with the maternal grandmother, plans to place the child in the permanent care and custody of the paternal grandmother, who will be responsible for the child's nutrition and physical well-being. The father, V.M., who is a convicted child abuser, has been sentenced to thirty-nine months in prison as a result of his conviction for child abuse. He has been in contact with the child since apprehension, but there was an indication baby food was being fed to the child when she was not quite four months old and not ready for it. The maternal grandmother indicated that she would move to a larger residence if she were granted custody. HELD: The child was placed with the permanent custody of R.S. (the maternal grandmother) and R.M.'s (the paternal grandmother) plan of care, which was reviewed by the court, was made the sole recommendation that the child be placed with a maternal grandmother who would provide supervised access to both parents on a frequent and regular basis. Although number of her children have been in regular conflict with the law, the mother has always exercised proper parenting skills. Both parents do not have the ability to successfully parent their own child without there being sufficient risks to their healthy development.

At the hearing on the application, the executor, under cross-examination, admitted that he had 'done a disservice to the estate' and that his actions were a 'perfect example of why executors shouldn't have done what I have done.' The Chambers judge found that the executor converted estate funds to his own use and ordered the appellant to post security pursuant to the Act. The executor appealed. He submitted that the Court had not explicitly determined that he had committed waste, and accordingly there was no basis or foundation for an order requiring him to post security. Dismissing the appeal, that the appellant's own admissions under oath were sufficient bases for the Court's finding. This was also one of those rare occasions where solicitor and client costs on the appeal were warranted, as the executor's actions amounted to a serious dereliction of duty which the Court termed reprehensible and unconscionable.","The appellant, sole executor of his estate, appealed from a probate decision which had directed him to reimburse the estate for certain bequests and a bequest made to his niece and her brother in the amount of $10,000 to the Zion Lutheran Church. Dismissing the appeal, that the probate judge erred in (1) permitting an order without first requiring proof of and making determination of whether Mr. Saunders was wasting the estate; (2) ordering the executor's file to be delivered to the court; and (3) ordering costs to be awarded on a solicitor and client basis. The appellant had practised law for in excess of forty years before his retirement in the early 1990's and was known to have made a number of small but significant undertakings as executor. His last will, which was submitted to probate in 1997, disclosed that he had converted some of the estate funds to his own use. Bequests 'paid' were listed at $88,000.

The landlord argued the hearing officer erred in his decision on the facts. HELD: The Court is statutorily restricted to addressing questions of law or of jurisdiction. This function means that where there is some relevant evidence to support a finding of fact, that finding may not be disturbed on appeal.

d_2013skpc206.txt,"HELD: The Court concluded that the $1,000 loan did not exist, there was nothing on the books showing an advance of wages as submitted by the plaintiff. The Court was not satisfied that the defendant husband received a loan from the plaintiff in the amount of $5,000. There was no loan documentation, which would be expected given the money was advanced from the plaintiff corporation. The plaintiff never demanded any of the money be paid back until just before issuing the statement of claim. The Court also held that the $5,000 to the defendant wife was a gift. The counterclaim of $2,400 was not proven; there was no evidence that these payments were not made with consent. The $960 should not have been taken off of the defendant husband’s cheque because the $1,000 and $5,000 loans were not made out. The defendant husband was successful in this portion of his counterclaim. The Court found that $2,400 given to the plaintiff by the defendant wife was also by agreement. The defendant wife’s testimony with respect to her hours worked were favoured over the plaintiff’s. The defendant wife was overpaid for work in November so the plaintiff was only owed $32.32. The plaintiff filed an inaccurate Record of Employment knowing that the defendant wife was trying to obtain employment insurance. The amount of damages owing to the defendant wife was adjourned to allow her to make a new claim with Service Canada for employment insurance given the Court’s determination of her hours worked, which would be enough to qualify for employment insurance.","The plaintiff puts forward that he loaned $5,000 to the defendants, with an additional $1,000 being paid to the plaintiff. The defendants are new to Canada and to large extent reliant upon John and his family for their employment and housing, it would not be out of the ordinary for the plaintiff to provide them with a gift to start their new life in Canada. Although the cheques come from the corporate plaintiff, the corporation is controlled by John. The plaintiff states that he gave the money to the defendant as a gift. The defendant testified that they sent out a demand letter close to the time of issuing the Statement of Claim, but there was no request to pay it back earlier. There is no record of what happened between the defendant and the plaintiff except for the fact that the defendant signed the cheque and gave it back. HELD: The plaintiff's claim is adjourned to a date to be determined by the parties and the Court.  1) The amount of damages is not known at this time and as the defendant may be able to now qualify and receive funds retroactively for special benefits from Service Canada in light of the Court's finding that she has worked 604 hours. It may be that there are no damages incurred by the defendant if she can now obtain the payments that she lost. If she is not able to obtain these payments, the Court will hear evidence and argument on the quantum of damages to be paid by the plaintiff Lilia.  2) Lilia's counterclaim is not proven on a balance of probabilities. There was no evidence to support the conclusion that the loan was agreed to by Lilia as she was a corporation. It would be simple for the corporation to have asked for and received loan documentation if in fact they were loaning money to them. There of course is no need for documentation if it is simply gift to assist the defendants with their start in Canada journey.  3) The payback of the loan as set out in the statement of claim at $500 per month was never taken from the defendant's wages, which the plaintiff testified was part of the agreement. It is also unclear as to why the amount of $400.00 was taken, when he stated the agreement was to be $500. This does not affect how Lilia testified that she had worked more than 600 hours, which she had in mind, in order to obtain maternity leave. 4) There were several inconsistencies in the testimony of Lilia, including her testimony that she gave the defendant $2,000 cash"
4_2004skqb280.txt,"This was an application pursuant to The Inter-jurisdictional Support Orders Act for a declaration of paternity and child support. HELD: By agreement there was an order pursuant to s. 45 of The Children's Law Act, 1997 declaring the respondent the biological father of the child. The respondent does not currently earn sufficient income to pay child support. He was to advise the petitioner within 30 days if he receives an offer of employment or contract and if so, the terms of his employment including his gross income. 1) The respondent's ability to earn income is limited by his health to sedentary types of employment. There is no suggestion or evidence that his pursuit of education is unreasonable.  2) An individual who chooses to be underemployed or unemployed to avoid paying child support is 'intentionally underemployed or unemployed'. That is not the only circumstance envisioned by s. 19(1)(a) of the Guidelines. The Court adopted the reasoning of the Manitoba Court of Appeal in Donovan v. Donovan and the Ontario Court of Appeal in Drygala v. Pauli and found that 'intentional' extends to situations where a parent required to pay child support chooses, for whatever reason, to earn less than they are capable of earning. The fact that the parent chooses to be underemployed or unemployed, brings their situation within the meaning of 'intentional' and creates the circumstances envisioned by s. 19(1)(a). The reason for such a choice does not change the fact it is intentional, but it may impact on the Court's decision whether to exercise its discretion and impute income.","FIAT: This is an application pursuant to the Inter-jurisdictional Support Orders Act (I-10.03) by Ms. [V.G.B.] for a declaration of paternity and child support. HELD: 1) The parties never lived together but had an intimate relationship which resulted in the birth of a child. 2) The child support order was set at a rate higher than the Table amount based on undue hardship. The onus is on the applicant to establish that any continued unemployment is unintentional or, if intentional, that it is reasonable in the circumstances and does not warrant the imputation of income.  3) Section expenses are often referred to as “add ons” to Table support. These expenses cover items that are not normally covered in regular child support orders. Some s. expenses such as those relating to extracurricular activities must be 'extraordinary'. The child’s current income is below the amount normally required for Table support and her standard of living is below that of the respondent. If neither of the parties obtained employment or, in the event the respondent obtains employment, the court must determine whether he obtained employment and, if so, his remuneration from that position."
b_2010skqb311.txt,"The accused was charged with having aftermarket tint on the side windows of his vehicle. He appealed on other grounds. The summary conviction appeal judge raised the issue of the sufficiency of the charge on its own motion. The face of the ticket purported to charge the accused with an offence under s. 66(3) of The Vehicle Equipment Regulations. HELD: The charge was declared a nullity because it was drafted so poorly that it did not give fair notice to the accused of the charge or the penalty to be imposed if breach was established. Section 66(3) of The Vehicle Equipment Regulations purports to make displaying aftermarket tint an offence, but the section is a charging offence and does not prescribe a penalty. The correct way to charge an accused with this offence is under s. 113 of The Traffic Safety Act which makes it an offence to operate a motor vehicle on a public highway that is not equipped in accordance with the regulations. The count could not be amended to cure the defect because the charge was a nullity and void ab initio. The conviction was quashed.","The appellant appealed his conviction and sentence following his conviction in Traffic Safety Court for 'unlawfully have sunscreen in front side windows' contrary to's. 66(3) The Vehicle Equipment Regulations'. The Crown tendered evidence of previous convictions for the same type of offence with the same vehicle and asked the court to impose a fine of $200. The traffic justice found the appellant guilty as charged. The appellant did not exercise the voluntary payment option and instead sent an agent to appear on his behalf on the March 10, 2008, return date at which time a 'not guilty' plea was entered and the matter was set down for trial. No one appeared on that date. The Crown was given leave to proceed ex parte and trial was held. The peace officer testified that the appellant was operating his Hummer with after-market tinted windows on a public highway. The police conducted a breath sample after demand was made and the officer issued a certificate of offence. The vehicle had tinted side windows. The officer applied for a copy of the Certificate of offence, which was used to file a written argument on the sufficiency of the charge. HELD: The appeal was allowed and the conviction quashed. 1)It was not possible to amend the count to cure the defect. The count cannot be amended so as to breathe life into something that is nullity. 2)Because the count is a nullity and the statute does not provide proper notice to the accused of the nature of the offence or the penalties that may be imposed if a breach is established, the appeal could not be allowed.  3)The Court was of the view that it did not have the statutory authority to make a charge nullity, even if it did provide a proper remedy. The statute does provide a number of steps to remedy the problem, but not the legislative authority to do so. The pleadings were not exact. It was not uncommon for courts to quash informations or indictments for even the smallest technical defect."
b_2012skqb350.txt,"The applicant wife sought an order requiring the husband to pay the equalization payment under a consent judgment or alternatively that the consent judgment be set aside and trial dates ordered. The consent judgment provided that the husband should make an equalization payment of $105,000 to be composed of cash and/or a rollover of retirement funds. The husband wants to satisfy the judgment by paying the sum of $5,000 in cash and rolling over $100,000 in RRSPs, unreduced for tax. Applying a 25% discount for tax, the proposal is equivalent to $80,000. The husband argued that the consent order was not dispositive and that if the tax implications were a controlling factor they should have been specifically addressed in the judgment.HELD: The Court held that it is common practice in family property distributions to discount RRSPs to their after-tax value. The fact that that principle was not stated explicitly in the judgment was not fatal to the application. The evidence introduced at the hearing of the wife's position in pre-trial calculations clearly indicated that she expected the discount for tax on RRSPs. Therefore, the Court ordered that the judgment be satisfied by way of rollover of RRSPs in the amount of $111,600.","FIAT: The issue is the interpretation of a consent judgment based on negotiated family property settlement. Present counsel for the husband is new to the file, and was not the lawyer involved in the settlement. The wife seeks an order requiring the husband to pay the equalization payment or alternatively that the consent judgment be set aside and trial dates ordered. HELD: 1) The consent judgment is to be interpreted in the same manner as an agreement. Negotiations are not relevant. The court must examine the context in which the order was issued, evaluate the order in accordance with the circumstances of the case, and question whether the acts or omissions could reasonably have been contemplated to fall under the terms of the order. 2) The wife's outline of the family property and debts provides the necessary context for an appreciation of the discussions that followed, and it is therefore necessary to outline the calculations in some detail. 3) The husband argues that the trial judge erred in failing to discount the value of funds held as RRSPs to adjust for tax implications. He argues that RRSP assets should be significantly discounted to reduced after tax value as at the date of division. To entertain the husband's proposition would be to construe the judgment in an unnatural sense."

The plaintiff's claim was dismissed by court order dated March 21, 2001.

Awarding the plaintiff $2,500 plus disbursements relating to the application, that the jury would be capable of understanding the issues better understood by a properly informed jury. Although the expert evidence was of such complexity and was the usual type of analysis expected with most claims, particularly those involving significantly disabling injuries, it was the case that the applicant's substantive right to a trial by jury should be denied.

Dismissing the appeal, that the insurer of a subcontractor on a construction project was not liable to contribute to payment of a fire loss by the insurer of the principle contractor where the risk was allocated by the contract documents to the principle contractor and not the subcontractor.","An appeal from a decision declaring that the respondent Guardian was not liable to contribute to payment of a fire loss that was insured against by the appellant Hartford. The contract allocated the risk for fire loss to Fraser-Brace and required them to obtain fire insurance to protect the parties against fire loss. Hartford sued to recover its money with interest from Hartford on the basis that the policy had been issued under the mistaken belief by the respondent that it was required to carry builder's risk insurance. The trial judge found the building was never at the insured's risk and the policy was void and ordered Hartford to repay Guardian the advances with compound interest. Several issues had been raised on appeal including whether the respondent had no obligation to pay the fire loss as Delta, under its subcontract with Fraser Brace, was neverAt Risk for Fire Loss by the contract with the Province. As Delta did not cause the fire, it had no liability to the Province or its insurer for causing the fire. HELD: Appeal dismissed. 1)There was no evidence nor even suggestion that Delta caused the fire nor that there was an obligation to reimburse the respondent for the risk. 2)The appellant's assertion that there should not be an implied implied obligation to contribute by the pre-judgment agreement between the respondent and the insurer as implied by the policy issued to them was not supported by the evidence. 3)The respondent was not required to contribute."
1999canlii12687.txt,"The accused was charged with three offences under the Narcotic Control Act. The accused contests the admissibility of marijuana plants seized by the police. A police officer on highway patrol approaching the Manitoba border noticed a rental van with Ontario license plates stopped on the road. The police officer stated he had no reason to believe an offence had been committed and he approached the accused to see if he required any assistance. The officer stated it was his practice to offer assistance to motorists. The officer asked the accused if there were any problems with the vehicle and the accused answered he was looking for a place to relieve himself. The officer asked him where he was going and was told BC. He then asked the accused what he had in the back of the van and was told two cases of wine. The officer testified the accused was no longer free to go as he had believed the accused committed an offence under the Alcohol and Gaming Regulation Act. The officer searched the vehicle without a warrant and discovered 524 marijuana plants ranging in size from three to nine inches. HELD: The evidence is excluded. The police officer when he pulled up to the van was not in investigative mode but pulled up to see if he could offer assistance. The officer had no reason to suspect the accused was involved in a crime. When he asked what was in the back of the van the officer was fishing to see what answer he got. The Court is satisfied by the cases of Mellenthin, Young and Simpson, that if a person who has been detained cannot be asked what is in their gym bag or their pocket, how can a citizen who is not detained be asked a similar question. The s.8 right against unreasonable search and seizure involves balancing the citizen's reasonable expectation of privacy against the states interest in law enforcement. The police officer's question as to what was in the back of the van was unrelated to the purpose for which he had engaged the accused in conversation. The fact is the officer was attempting to determine what was in the back of the van and searching to see what answer he would get. The Court is satisfied the warrantless search began when the police officer asked the accused what was in the back of the van. The onus of a warrantless search is on the crown which has not established the search was authorized by law. The accused's right to unreasonable search and seizure was violated. The evidence was conscriptive in that the accused was compelled to participate in the discovery of the evidence as a result of the unreasonable search which began when the officer asked what was in the back of the van. The result is the admission of the marijuana into evidence would render the trial unfair and bring the administration of justice into disrepute unless the crown establishes that the evidence would likely have been discovered in any event. The crown suggested no basis upon which the evidence would likely have been discovered in any event.","The accused was charged with unlawfully traffic in a narcotic pursuant to s. 4(1) of the Narcotic Control Act and with unlawfully cultivating marijuana in a vehicle. A voir dire was conducted to determine the admissibility of marijuana plants seized as a result of a warrantless search. The police officer observed the accused operating a rental van with Ontario licence plates stop on a grid road leading to a tourist information booth. As he approached the vehicle, he noticed that one of the pockets of the accused's jeans appeared to be bulging and he asked if he could empty his pockets. The accused said he was looking for a place to relieve himself. At this point the police officer indicated that there were no officers working in the detachment that day. HELD: 1) The accused was not detained. He was not asked to open the back of the van. The search was made without the requisite foundation of reasonable and probable grounds. It was therefore an unreasonable search in contravention of s. of the Charter.  2) The Court found that the accused did not require a warrant as he did not have any reasonable or probable grounds to believe that the marijuana plants were in the vehicle. 3) The evidence was not relevant to determining whether the accused required any assistance. There were no exigent circumstances upon which the search could have been conducted. 4) Counsel was satisfied the accused was fishing to see what answer he got. The question had nothing to do with determining whether he required assistance. The conversation was admissible under common law principles as part of the Crown's case against the accused. The right to silence as protected by s. 7 is a fundamental right protected by the fundamental right of fundamental justice. It is said the Court recognized that the random stop of motor vehicle amounts to an arbitrary detention and that there is an atmosphere of police authority and compulsion when a motorist is stopped by police officer. The present situation did not involve a roadside check stop. The Court held the accused had been detained arbitrarily whether the detention commenced when the constable stopped him on the street, when he requested him to empty his pants, or when he put him in the rear of the cruiser. Counsel raised the following issues arising from the Charter: 1. Was there an arbitrary detentions contrary to the Charter; 2. Was the search unreasonable contrary to s.(e) the Charter? The Court was satisfied that the officer was conducting an objective search of the vehicle and did not see any evidence of an offence. The issue to be decided was whether the arrest and detention"

The defendant was noted for default on this claim and the damages were assessed at $37,717.35, $10,000 of which were punitive. The plaintiff submits that s.102 of the Act should not deprive a citizen of the right to sue a defendant for injuries caused by assault, battery, fraud, or similar torts. HELD: The plaintiff has no cause for action by virtue of her injuries having been caused by an automobile. The plaintiff was precluded by s.102 of the Act from commencing a valid legal action with the result that the judgment obtained is a nullity. Although s.102 of the Act prohibits certain types of law suits, the act provides victims with compensation for injury. No order as to costs.","The plaintiff applied for an order pursuant to s.55 of the Automobile Accident Insurance Act requiring Saskatchewan Government Insurance to pay to the plaintiff the amount awarded to her in a 1998 judgment. The plaintiff had been pinned between an automobile operated by the defendant and a stationary motor vehicle, thereby causing personal injury. She applied for summary judgment, but was required to proceed to a hearing to assess her damages. HELD: There must be a declaration that the plaintiff was precluded, by s. 102 of the Act, from commencing a valid legal action, with the result that the judgment obtained is a nullity. There will be no order as to costs. Herbert v. Misuga (1994), 1 S. Ct. 292 (C.A.) involved a claim against the defendant motor vehicle driver for damages for assault and battery. The question to be resolved was whether s. 143 of the then The Vehicles Act, 1983, repealed by The Vehicle Administration Act, S.S. 1986, c. V-2.1 applied. In order to accept the submission, it would have been necessary to conclude that the vehicle was not being used as a motor vehicle when it struck the plaintiff. The Saskatchewan Court of Appeal could not reach that conclusion and stated that the limitation period in s 143(1)(a) of the Vehicles Act applied. The action was scheduled to proceed without prejudice to SGI's assertion that the claim of the plaintiff is barred by statute."
7_1979canlii87.txt,"The appellant and respondent were adjoining landowners both claiming title to a portion of meadowland described as interval. Both held their property by deeds obtained at tax sales. Dismissing the appeal, that the respondent was entitled to a certificate of title to the land and a permanent injunction restraining the appellant from using said lands. The meaning of the word interval in describing lands in North America was discussed.","In a reserved decision, the trial judge found that the respondent was entitled to a certificate of title under the Quieting Titles Act to certain lands including the six acre portion in dispute and to a permanent injunction restraining the appellant and her assigns from using the said lands in any way whatsoever. The appellant appealed. Dismissing the appeal with costs, that the evidence more than supported the decision. The respondent relied on the deed to himself and to his predecessors in title and claimed title to the 73-acre parcel of land and to six acres of meadowland in dispute. HELD: The appeal was dismissed. 1)The land was encompassed by the two tax deeds. 2)If the word 'interval' did not appear in the explanation of the lands conveyed by the deed from the respondent to the appellant, it was more than amply supported by the evidence. 3)The respondent must show title by documentary proof, by clear evidence of conventional line or by adverse possession. The adverse possession claimed had not been established and so find because it was not adverse, continuous, open and notorious. 4)The appellant's conveyance of the land to her husband (and subsequently to her) convinced him that it was a straight line division and the acreage shortfall sustained by him was due to the bend in the river."
b_2013skpc213.txt,HELD: The Court found that the accused was guilty of both charges. The Court believed the testimony of the complainant.,"The accused was charged with committing sexual assault and for sexual purposes touching a person under the age of 16 directly with part of his body contrary to s. 151 of the Criminal Code. The complainant testified that she did not get along with the accused prior to the assault because of the way he treated her. She also alleged that he had fondled her and smelled alcohol on her. HELD: The accused was convicted of both counts. The Court found that the credibility of the witnesses was the most significant issue and an application of the instructions in R. v. W.D.[1] must be undertaken. It is entirely possible for the jury to disbelieve the evidence of the accused yet, in light of all of the evidence, conclude that they have reasonable doubt. The evidence of K.S., when describing what had occurred in her bedroom, told the Court that the accused had pulled the blanket away and that he removed his pants. The accused testified that he did not know if the blanket was removed or if she did see him remove his pants when she told the officer that she said 'no'. Further examination of all the evidence is necessary.  1) The Court was the trier of fact and law so am obliged to decide the facts in this case by applying the same principles that a jury would be required to apply. 2) The accused had not consumed alcohol until he drank vodka in the trailer that evening but his recollection of what happened was detailed and his evidence was not shaken in cross examination. 3) The complainant's testimony was entirely consistent with that of other witnesses. There was no suggestion that she was motivated by revenge or anything of the sort that was raised in the context of the statements made by the accused and the witnesses. The court found that although the complainant may not have believed the accused's version of events, she had not been convinced beyond a reasonable doubt by his evidence in a courtroom setting. Further examination is necessary to determine how the instructions are to be considered."
3_2001skqb332.txt,"An appeal of convictions on two offences under the Excise Tax Act. Grounds for the appeal were summarized as lack of jurisdiction to proceed because of alleged defects in the summons; alternatively, the appellants were not properly advised of the charges they were facing contrary to s.11(a) of the Charter; Kimery should not have been convicted of an offence contrary to s.330 when the information set out an offence contrary to s.326 of the Excise Tax Act; there was no evidence to justify a finding that the Goods and Services Tax returns were not filed; unreasonable delay compromised their right to a fair trial; the demand for a return which was filed was invalid as there was no proof that it was signed by a person authorized to sign on the Minister's behalf. HELD: The appeal was dismissed. 1)Any defects as to the form or service of the summons were unimportant. The record clearly indicated the appellants appeared, pleaded and proceeded with the trial and made no objection. Kimery never requested an adjournment nor was there any suggestion that he desired to be represented by counsel. There was nothing to suggest he was confused or misled by the proceedings or that he did not understand the nature of the charges the appellants were facing. The trial judge did everything required of him in the circumstances. 2)Section 330 does not set out a separate offence but merely clarifies the circumstances under which a director can be convicted of the same offence as a party. This is no different than the situation of an accused being charged with a substantive offence under the Criminal Code on the theory that he is a party by virtue of s.21 of the Criminal Code. Kimery was sole director of the corporation during the period in question when the returns were required to be filed. It was open to the trial judge to find he must have directly participated in or at least acquiesced in the failure to file the appropriate GST returns. 3)There was evidence to support the finding that the appellants failed to file returns as required by s.326. The appellants filed blank returns. The trial judge found as a fact that there was no information relating to GST in any of the documents.  It was agreed the returns were not merely defective but did not qualify as returns at all. 4)The appellants were not denied the right to a trial within a reasonable time as required by Charter s.11(b). Pre-charge delay is not a factor which can be taken into account at this stage. The appellant, having failed to rectify the omission after reasonable opportunities, could not now say they were somehow prejudiced. Once charges were laid, the matter proceeded to trial within a reasonable time.  5)The decision in R. v. Swyryda is a complete answer to the argument that the field position of 'Director Tax Services Office' was not authorized to exercise the powers and perform the duties of the Minister. Also, s.24(2) of the Interpretation Act gives implied powers to persons acting under the authority of a minister of any Crown department over which that minister resides to undertake any act or do anything on behalf of the minister if that person is acting in a capacity appropriate to do the act or thing. Section 24(2) appears to be a codification of the common law, frequently referred to as the Carltona principle based upon the 1943 English case, and followed in R. v. Harrison where the SCC held that responsible and experienced officials will have the ability to exercise the Minister's authority in accomplishing Ministerial duties. The service of the demand in this case was not part of an explicit statutory or regulatory scheme of delegation. It falls under an implicit scheme of delegation and sub-delegation as allowed at common law and in accordance with the Federal Interpretation Act.  The execution and service of a demand to file a GST return is purely an administrative act.  It does not require the exercise of Ministerial discretion nor does it deprive any citizen of any right by restricting a right to appeal. The notice simply requires a taxpayer to comply with the statutory requirements of the Act. The fact that the true copy of the notice annexed to the affidavit of service contains a facsimile signature is not significant.",The appellants appealed their convictions for two offences under the Excise Tax Act. The provisions of the Act provide for an implicit scheme of delegation of authority to be exercised by someone specifically designated by the Minister pursuant to the regulations. The Act does not set out a separate offence but merely clarifies the circumstances under which a director can be convicted of the same offence as a party. There was no error by the trial judge in finding that the returns purportedly filed were not merely defective but did not qualify as returns at all. The appellants had filed blank returns. The trial judge found as a fact that there was no information relating to GST in any of the documents filed. The appeal was dismissed.
b_1997canlii10986.txt,"FIAT. The plaintiffs applied for an order striking out the statement of defence and counterclaim and separate statement of Helen Rilkoff as not disclosing a reasonable defence or cause of action. The plaintiffs claimed the doctrine of res judicata applied to the claim for damages by virtue of two Small Claims court judgments in 1989 and 1992. The defendants asserted their damages arose in 1994 and that the cause thereof was different than those previously dealt with. HELD: The application was dismissed with costs to the defendants in any event of the cause. 1)The fact that the plaintiffs filed a 55 page brief in support of their submissions and the defendants filed a 14 page brief in response evidenced that the issues were not easily resolved and certainly not on a summary basis.  2)An application to strike out pleadings basically permits only an examination of the impugned pleadings to determine if any justifiable dispute is revealed. If no facts are in dispute, the parties may resort to Rule 188. Only if the defendants consented to the application being converted into an application pursuant to Queen's Bench Rule 188 could the court proceed to resolve the questions of law.","FIAT The plaintiffs applied for an order pursuant to Queen's Bench Rule 173 striking out the statements of defence and counter-claim of Jeffrey and Karen Rilkoff and the separate statement of defence of Helen. The plaintiffs claim their damages arose in 1994 and that the cause thereof was a different cause than those dealt with in the 1989 and 1992 judgments. The defendants have referred to judgment of this Court in support of their allegation that if the resolutions authorizing the assessments do not include a provision for charging interest on unpaid assessments and solicitor/client costs, the plaintiffs are not entitled to do so. They also alleged that the issues raised in the defendants' statement of defense do not disclose a reason for their claim and do not show a reasonable cause of action. HELD: The application of the plaintiffs was bedismissed with costs to the defendants in any event of the cause. 1)The preconditions for hearing applications pursuant to Rule 188 are quite different to those relating to Rule 173 in that an application to strike out pleadings basically permits only an examination of the impugned pleadings to determine if any justiciable dispute is revealed. Only if the defendants consented to the application being converted into an application pursuant to rule 188 could the court proceed to resolve what appeared to be rather serious questions of law. 2)The Court was not permitted to embark upon the resolution of legal questions in order to determine whether the pleadings should be struck as requested. If no facts are in dispute, the parties may resort to Queen’s Bench Rule 188, which permits resolution of those sorts of questions prior to trial if the resolution thereof will resolve the dispute between the parties or significant aspects of the dispute. It was also asserted that the raising of such issues is an abuse of the process of the court. 3)Costs were bedisted with the plaintiffs’ application in the cause of thecause."
c_2007skqb224.txt,"FIAT: The accused applicant brings an application for a change in venue in this matter pursuant to s. 599(1) of the Criminal Code. HELD: 1). The application for a change of venue is denied. 2) There is no evidence of a general prejudicial attitude in Saskatoon as a whole that would justify a change in venue. There has been significant pre-trial publicity in this case from media reports of the case and other similar cases involving knives, as well as ongoing memorial reports. However, the accused has not met the onus necessary to succeed on its application. In other cases the existence of some memorial fundraising and memorials in the victim's names led the courts in those instances to grant a change in venue. However, in allowing the application, the courts in those cases both referenced the relatively small size of the judicial centers in which the trials were to be held, thereby making it more than likely an impartial jury pool could not be found. Saskatoon is not a small judicial centre. It is more populated than the Prince Albert judicial district to where the accused requests the case be transferred and is much larger than the judicial district of Humboldt, which might also be considered.","FIAT: The applicant brought an application for a change of venue in this matter pursuant to s.599(1) of the Criminal Code. The accused seeks an order granting a trial in the City of Prince Albert or such other judicial centre as the Court deems appropriate. The Crown counsel opposed the application. HELD: 1)It is well established that jurors may enter the trial with biases. But the law presumes that jurors' views and biases will be cleansed by the trial process. It therefore does not permit a party to challenge their right to sit on the jury because of the existence of widespread bias alone. 2)A reasonably serene environment is still possible in Saskatoon. The majority of media reports are over a year old. There is no evidence that the media reports have created a frightened or enraged community such as was the case in Charest. The more recent reports are generally factual references to the progress of the case. There are safeguards in the system to cleanse the jurors' eyes. 3)The onus is on the accused to establish by evidence that a fair and impartial trial cannot be held in the closest judicial district. In the circumstances, despite the examples of media coverage referred to in the affidavits, there is no question that the accused has not met the onus of proof necessary to succeed on this application."
3_1994canlii3972.txt,"After an argument with his girlfriend, the appellant drove his car at high speed with the lights off, running two stop signs. At the second intersection he collided with another vehicle, causing serious injury to three people. He pleaded guilty to three counts of dangerous driving causing bodily harm; the Crown proposed an intermittent sentence, but the judge sentenced him to nine months incarceration concurrent on each count plus two years probation with conditions. The appellant appealed on the grounds the judge failed to consider the Crown's recommendation, failed to sufficiently state his reasons, and the sentence was excessive. Dismissing the appeal, that the sentencing power of a judge is not limited by Crown submissions, that the failure to state every reason does not constitute and error, and that in view of the appellant's record and other factors, the sentence was not excessive to the point of constituting a reversible error.","The 19-year-old appellant pled guilty to three charges of dangerous driving causing bodily harm following an argument with his girlfriend. He was sentenced to nine months incarceration plus two years probation on each charge to be served concurrently. He suffered a broken arm and an undisplaced pelvic fracture and fractured ribs, and two fractures to his cervical spine. He also had five previous motor vehicle accidents and three infractions involving the use of motor vehicle. The three Criminal Code convictions indicate a lack of respect for the law, which was demonstrated as well in his actions at issue. The appeal was dismissed."
6_2006nsca89.txt,"Six years after the action was commenced, the plaintiff applied to add the defendant's Section D insurer in order to add a cause of action against an unidentified driver. The limitation period for suing under Section D had expired and no notice of the application had been given to the insurer. The chambers judge held that he had no discretion to grant the amendment and dismissed the application. The plaintiff appealed. Appeal allowed; the plaintiff is entitled to renew the application for the amendment in Supreme Court chambers on notice to the proposed, as well as the existing, defendant within sixty days of today's date; if not filed within that time, the application to add the insurer will be deemed to have been abandoned. The court had a discretion to grant the amendment even though the case did not fall within any of the specific situations set out in Rule 15.02 as the broad power to amend conferred by Rule 15 is not limited to the specific instances set out the Rule. Although there was no firm rule that notice to a proposed defendant was necessary in all such applications, generally the applicant should give notice to the proposed defendant (as well as the existing parties) where it is apparent from the circumstances that the proposed defendant likely has a reasonable basis to oppose being joined, such as being prejudiced in its defence by the plaintiff's long delay in asserting his claim.","The appellant sues the Halifax Regional Municipality for negligence. Years later, he decided he should amend his action to add a new claim against a new defendant. By then, the new claim was barred by a limitation period. He applied in Supreme Court chambers for permission to make the amendment. The chambers judge held that he did not have authority under Rules 15.01 and 15.02 to grant leave to the appellant to amend his statement of claim to add Lombard as a party and to assert the Section cause of action against it. The appellant applied to renew the application. The issue was whether the judge should have granted the amendment because this case did not fall into any of the specific powers to amend in the Civil Procedure Rules. HELD: The appeal was allowed and the application to set aside was allowed. The decision on whether the amendment should be granted was not appealed. The matter was left to the Supreme Court to decide. 1)Limidity of the Rules in relation to limitation periods had limited the judge's discretion to grant the amendment; the Rule 5.04(2)(b) and (c)authority to amend did not apply in this case. 2)The limitation period had intervened and an important consideration relates to whether the appellant's delay has prejudiced the defendant's defence. Lombard should receive notice in these circumstances."
8_1996canlii4963.txt,The appellant was acquitted of communicating with another person for the purpose of prostitution. A new trial was ordered on the basis that the Provincial Court judge included a requirement as an element of the actus reus for an offence under s.213 that there be a specific conversation with the respect to payment of money for specified sexual services. The Queen's Bench judge concluded that this was an error in law and cited as a correct test that set out in R. v. Schmidt. HELD: The proper disposition is to set aside the judgment and restore the decision of the Provincial Court acquitting the appellant of the offence. 1)On reading the entire oral judgment the court concluded that the judge was saying in effect that the evidence failed to convince her beyond a reasonable doubt that the offence had taken place. 2)The trial judge was incorrect in finding that under s.213 the actus reus must include a specific conversation specifying the sexual services and the money to be paid.,"The appellant was acquitted after trial in the Provincial Court of communicating with another person for the purpose of engaging in prostitution contrary to s. 213(1)(c) of the Code. However, on appeal to the Court of Queen's Bench a new trial was ordered, and this appeal arose. HELD: The Court of Appeal declined to admit a nonsuit. 1)The Chief of the Provincial Police interpreted her oral reasons to include a requirement as an element of the actus reus for an offence under s.213 that there be a specific conversation with respect to payment of money for specified sexual services. The fact that the conversation did not reach the point where the matter of payment was discussed would not preclude a jury from reasonably concluding that an act of prostitution involving the payment of payments for sexual favours was contemplated. 2)The entire reasons must be read to understand the true ratio. 3)The facts before the learned Chief judge constituted evidence from which a properly instructed jury could reasonably infer that the respondent was communicating with a female Person for the purposes of engaging with a specific sexual service and for which he intended to pay. The evidence is similar to that of the respondent in that he approached a woman unknown to him in an area where prostitutes were plying their trade, invited her into his automobile, inquired if she was interested in sex and wanted to know if the police officer was a police officer. There was no need, in view of our disposition, to conduct an extensive review of the facts. There is no need to conduct a re-hearing of the entire oral judgment."
4_2011skpc13.txt,"The accused was charged with impaired care or control. The Court dismissed the charge of care or control over .08 after a non-suit application. During re-examination of the final Crown witness, and after the defence had concluded its cross-examination of the witness, it became apparent that the disclosure package given to both the Crown and Defence did not include the bottom portion of the Intoxilizer Operator's Checklist because it had been cut off during photocopying. During the defence cross-examination, the officer testified that he could not recall if the accused had slurred speech. In re-direct, the Crown showed the officer the original Intoxilizer Operator's Checklist and the officer confirmed that it listed slurred speech in the observations section.  The accused applied for relief under s. 24(1) of the Charter alleging a breach of his right to make full answer and defence. HELD: The defence lawyer did not know the full content of the Intoxilizer Operator's Checksheet until after he had completed his cross-examination of the author of the document. The Court was satisfied that if the defence lawyer had been aware of what was noted in the document, he would not have challenged the officer on his failure to mention that the accused's speech was slurred because he would have been able to predict that such a question would result in re-direct by the Crown. The accused suffered actual prejudice in his right to make full answer and defence and a breach of s. 7 is made out. While the Court cannot attribute bad faith to either the RCMP or the Crown, the Court was satisfied that the prosecutor referred to the original checksheet during its re-examination of the officer without taking sufficient time and care to ensure that the original was what had been disclosed to the Crown and Defence. This is an exceptional case where the lack of full disclosure and the time at which it was discovered rendered the trial unfair in a way that can only be remedied by excluding the evidence under s. 24(1).","The accused, charged with impaired driving, applied to the Court pursuant to s. 24(1) and s. 2 of the Charter for a variety of remedies, including a stay of the impaired driving charge, an order for a mistrial on that count, a direction that the Crown prosecutor be allowed to further cross-examine Crown witnesses and an order excluding evidence. The accused suffered actual prejudice in his right to make full answer and defence as a result of a lack of full disclosure.HELD: The Court found that the officer did not make any notation in his notes or in his General Occurrence Report about his observations of the accused and, in the context of how and when the failure in disclosure came to light in this case, the trial was unfair in a way that it was not satisfied can be remedied through an adjournment and disclosure order or by exclusion. The Court was satisfied on a balance of probabilities that the accused's rights under s. 7 were infringed."
9_2013skca110.txt,"HELD: The Court addressed the issue of jurisdiction by holding that it would follow its usual practice to refuse to hear an entirely new matter argued for the first time on appeal. Since the order being appealed from was not a Part II order under SCNA, what was being appealed was a procedural order under Queen’s Bench Rule 173 and the inherent jurisdiction of the Court, and therefore the Court had jurisdiction to hear the appeal pursuant to ss. 7 and 8 of the Court of Appeal Act. The Court held with respect to the decision in Chambers that the judge properly exercised her discretion and did not err in refusing to grant the stay requested. The Chambers judge appropriately balanced the factors respecting the fairness of allowing re-litigation and determined in all of the circumstances that it would not be unfair to the appellant to allow the SCNA application to succeed because the purpose of that legislation was different and had a wider ambit of The Residential Tenancies Act. However, the result of this appeal could not be taken to have decided whether a public officer’s actions pursuant to a statutory power could be an abuse of process or that an application under The Residential Tenancies Act to terminate a tenancy by the director and subsequent SCNA application respecting the same residence may never be questioned in any circumstances.","The applicant appealed the chambers judge's decision dismissing his application under Rule 173(e) of the Queen's Bench Rules of Court and the inherent jurisdiction of the Court to strike out or stay the application of the Director of Community Operations for a community safety order under The Safer Communities and Neighbourhoods Act because the Director's application constituted a multiplicity of proceedings and was therefore an abuse of process. The Chambers judge did not meet the three tests set out in s. 25(1)(a) and s. 2(b) of The Court of Appeal Act, 2000 and neither she nor the applicant applied to strike the stay or any of the other applications. HELD: The application was dismissed. The court held that the jurisdiction to hear the appeal was limited by the provisions of s. 24 of The Queen’s Bench Rule 173 and that a stay was not appropriate. As the applicant did not ask to overturn factual determinations made by the Hearing Officer, he failed to determine that the broader test for abuse of a process had been met. The application before the court was determined to be an interlocutory appeal from decision which is part of an application under SCAN."

The order was made to diminish the disparity between the income and lifestyles of the parties. The application for interim distribution of property was dismissed. The court found that this was not a situation where the net assets exceeded the amount of the distribution claimed. As the respondent had no liquid assets, the distribution of family property might eventually involve a spousal rollover from the pension funds to the petitioner.","FIAT: The wife applies for interim spousal support and an order providing her with an interim distribution of property in the amount of $25,000. HELD: 1) The court has authority to order an interim dividend pursuant to s. 26(2) of The Family Property Act, SS 1997. In this instance there is some dispute between the parties as to whether they have any beneficial interest in the house they were residing in at the date of separation (which appears to be legally owned by a third party) as they concede that this issue cannot be resolved on an interim motion. 2) At an interim stage it is often quoted that the paramount consideration at an early stage of the breakdown is “need and ability to pay”. However, this is not a situation where the net assets far exceed the amount claimed. In addition, ultimately the distribution may have to be by way of spousa rollover from the locked-in retirement funds as there appear to be no liquid assets available to the husband. The wife’s application for an interim payment of the property is dismissed. 3) At this interim stage the wife must absorb the immediate cost of the dispute.

HELD: The appeal was dismissed with costs. 1)There was clearly no basis for adding the value of the grain on hand to the income of the respondent. There was no indication of any underhanded or inappropriate action on the part of the respondent and the grain was to be viewed as part of his gross income in the year in which it was sold. 2)There was no reversible error by the chamber judge in accepting the respondent's agreement to include 20 percent of his capital cost allowance as part of his income. What if any portion should be added must be based on the facts of each case.,"The appellant sought to have the support payments ordered by the chamber judge increased on the basis the respondent was incorrectly estimated and should have been found to be much greater. The respondent agreed to include 20 percent of his capital cost allowance as part of his income and this was accepted by the trial judge who recognized that commercial realities require the replacement of farm equipment. HELD: The appeal was dismissed with the usual costs on double Column V. The appellant's income is largely the product of the operation of a relatively small farm, augmented by some outside earnings. The trial judge accepted the respondent's income by adding the value of unsold grain on hand and 100 percent of myCapital cost allowance. What, if any, portion of the capital cost allowances should be added to establish available income must be based on the facts of each case and we see no reversible error in the acceptance of this figure by the Chamber judge in this instance."

The Attorney General opposed severance on the ground the Government of Canada would be prejudiced in its claim for apportionment of the amount of any judgment as between the Government of Canada and the Oblates. HELD: It was in the best interests of justice that the order of severance be granted so the issue may proceed to an early trial. The issues of cross-claim and third party proceedings will take a very lengthy period of time. Hundreds of other claimants who have been asked by the management pre-trial judge to regard the plaintiff's action as a test case were awaiting a judgment.,FIAT: The applicant applied for an order severing the issues raised by his claim from those raised by the cross-claim and third party proceedings so that his claim may proceed to trial. The respondent vigorously opposed severance on the grounds that the Government of Canada would be prejudiced in its claim for apportionment of the amount of any judgment as between the governments of Canada and Les Oblats de Marie Immaculee du Manitoba. HELD: The order of severance sought by the applicant was granted so that the issue raised in the action could proceed to an early trial.  The action and the other actions pending resolution of this action were fairly dealt with under the Rules. The fears of procedural unfairness expressed by counsel for the Attorney General if the issues are severed are groundless.
9_1992canlii2588.txt,", The Crown appealed the acquittal of the respondent on a charge of assaulting his wife. The trial judge had found the respondent, who had taken a sleeping pill and was drunk at the time of the assault, did not have the intent to commit the assault. Allowing the appeal, that voluntary intoxication cannot be considered as raising a reasonable doubt as to intent in a general intent offence unless the degree of intoxication is so extreme that the accused did not even possess the minimal intent to perform the actus reus because his state was akin to automatism or insanity. The Court noted that no medical evidence as to the affect of the sleeping pill with the alcohol was adduced, nor was there any evidence concerning the strength of the pill or the amount of alcohol consumed and concluded that the evidence supported the conclusion that the respondent appreciated the circumstances of the assault, even though he could not remember it afterward. The Court set aside the acquittal and entered a verdict of guilty pursuant to s. 686(4)(b)(ii) of the Criminal Code as it had concluded that the respondent 'should have been found guilty but for the error in law'.","This was an appeal from the acquittal of the respondent on a charge of assaulting his wife. The evidence indicated that the respondent had come to visit his estranged wife. She had given him a sleeping pill and told him that he should not consume alcohol. He refused and pushed the wife against the wall. She tried to prevent him from leaving but he pursued her. He hit her and butted out a cigarette on her hand. At approximately 2:00 a.m. the following morning he returned to the wife's residence without any clothes on. He was inebriated and appeared to have difficulty remembering anything from the time he went out to have some drinks at bar at the Grand Hotel until the next morning when he woke up in his wife's apartment. He then went out drinking with some friends. He had no recollection of what happened next. Upon his return he was found not guilty. The respondent appealed. Dismissing the appeal with costs, that the Crown must prove an accused applied force intentionally in the case of an assault charge but to warrant acquittal based on intoxication the evidence of intoxication must be such that it shows an accused to have an absence of awareness akin to a state of automatism."
e_1992canlii2523.txt,"The appellant contended the trial judge erred in sentencing him to four years for an armed robbery charge, one year on a weapons charge to be served consecutively and a 10 year prohibition order because there were extenuating circumstances which should have resulted in a reduction in sentence.

The sentences were consistent with the range the Appeal Court had approved in numerous judgments.","This was an appeal against the sentences imposed by the trial judge. Although the appellant pled guilty to each of the two offences, there were extenuating circumstances in his favour that should have detracted from his conviction, there was nothing that the court could do about that. The appellant was represented by counsel. He was sentenced to four years imprisonment for the armed robbery and 1 year for the weapons offence, to be served consecutively. For the reasons given, the Court dismissed the appeal."
8_2010skca149.txt,"The father appealed from the decision of the Chamber's judge which varied the custody provisions of a consent judgment. The father had been unsuccessful in arguing for a shared custody arrangement in the Court below. The father argued that the Chamber's judge erred in her application of the best interests of the children and failed to apply the principle of maximum contact by applying a presumption in favour of the status quo and finding that the wishes of the children were irrelevant. For the first time on appeal, the father also argued that there was insufficient uncontroverted evidence before the Chambers judge to allow her to make a proper decision. HELD: The appeal was dismissed. It is implicit in the Chamber's decision that there was sufficient evidence before the Court to reach a conclusion about the best interests of the children and to find a change in circumstances. No error was made on this issue. The Chamber's judge correctly applied the test to determine the best interests of the children as articulated in Gordon v. Goertz. The Chamber's judge correctly concluded that the Act does not provide that the maximum contact principle alone provides a sufficient basis for ordering shared parenting. She addressed this principle in the context of the children's best interests. There is no evidence that the Chamber's judge stopped her inquiry at the status quo and that she did not assess the children's best interests against the proposed new circumstances and its impact upon them. The Chamber's judge was entitled to give limited or no weight to the wishes of the children. There is no material error or misapprehension of the evidence.","The father appeals from the decision of the Chambers judge which varied the custody provisions of a consent judgment dated March 30, 2005 governing custody and access to the parties' children. The application before the chambers judge also included child maintenance issues but the father does not appeal that part of the decision. HELD: Appeal dismissed. 1) The Chambers judge was entitled to consider only the impact of the change in circumstances when making her determination, by failing to apply the principle of maximum contact, by applying a presumption of the status quo and by finding that evidence as to the wishes of the children was irrelevant. 2) The evidentiary threshold necessary to make a decision based on all the uncontroverted evidence has been met. 3) There was an insufficient factual basis for the making of the custody order in issue. The matter was remitted to Queen's Bench for determination."
6_2009skqb201.txt,"A bankruptcy petition against the applicant was filed on May 18, 1995 and a receiving order with respect to her property issued the following month. KPMG Inc. (formerly Peat Marwick Thorne Inc.) is the trustee of her bankrupt estate. The applicant received an absolute discharge on March 8, 1996. The trustee has never applied for a discharge. The trustee did not oppose the applicant's discharge and in its report dated February 8, 1996 stated that the there were no facts, matters or circumstances that would justify the Court in refusing an unconditional order of discharge. Now, more than 13 years later, there remains an unresolved issue concerning non-exempt equity in the applicant's homestead. The applicant applies for relief under s. 37 of the Bankruptcy and Insolvency Act for an order reversing the trustee's decisions and restoring the property interest to her. The Court reviewed the relevant case law and found that only the value of non-exempt homestead equity existing at the time of the bankrupt's application for discharge can be attached by the trustee. HELD: The Court made the order applied for by the applicant including an order for costs.","Plaintiff's bankruptcy petition was filed in 1995 and received an absolute discharge in March 1996. The trustee never applied for discharge. HELD: The order for costs was granted. 1)Discounted non-exempt equity in the homestead did not exist at the time of the application for discharge nor after the trustee applied for it. The caveat should be vacated if it were not for the trustee's position that any increase in the equity will accrue to the benefit of the creditors. 2)The trustee did not oppose the applicant's discharge and in its report, prepared pursuant to s.170 of the Bankruptcy Act, the trustee stated that her duties under the Act had been satisfactorily performed; that her conduct either before or after the bankruptcy was not subject to censure; and that she had not committed any offence in connection with the bankruptcy. 3)The respondent's argument that it is appropriate in summary bankruptcy administration proceedings for a trustee to withhold timely application for release and await market enhancement of the value of non- exempt equity in homestead property can be taken by the trustee. Here the trustee was discharged whereas here the trustee is not. The respondent took the position that the applicant had no interest in the real property acquired after her bankruptcy and that if the applicant elected to re-open her homestead it would be subject to an absolute order. She also complained of the transmission being made without her having had an opportunity to oppose it because there was no hearing associated with her discharge. She alleged that the transmission was an arbitrary action taken without her agreement and knowledge and that there were no conditions precedent precedent precedent setting forth such an application. Costs will be provided by the applicant."
c_2007skqb355.txt,"FIAT: The plaintiff applies for orders requiring the defendant and third parties to answer questions and respond to undertakings arising from the examinations for discovery in this action pursuant to Rules 222, 231 and 232 of the Queen's Bench Rules and an order requiring the third parties to provide further and better disclosure of documents in their power pursuant to Rules 212 and 215. HELD: 1) A party to litigation cannot decline to answer questions on an examination for discovery that are intended to elicit the facts on which that party has based its pleading. A party is required to divulge the facts that it has now or admit that it has none if such is the case. The defendant is obligated to provide its responses to the undertakings before the examination for discovery of its proper officer is concluded so that he can be further examined on the responses. If the position of the defendant as set forth in those responses changes as a result of after acquired information, the defendant shall so inform the plaintiff by way of supplemental responses within 90 days following the completion of the defendant's examinations for discovery of the third parties. If it is necessary for the plaintiff to further examine for discovery on the defendant's responses or supplemental responses, the defendant's proper officer shall attend such examination for discovery. 2) The material filed satisfies the Court that PSAC documents relating to the PST issue are at least broadly relevant to the issues and that BJ Services likely has the power to obtain and produce them. The fact that BJ Services may intend to claim a litigation privilege over the documents, or that PSAC may not produce them, does not relieve BJ Services of the obligation to disclose their existence. BJ Services shall provide further and better disclosure of documents by providing a detailed list of documents referred to in the second part of the second schedule of its statement as to documents. If a claim for privilege is asserted over such documents, BJ Services shall identify the basis of such claim, the date of the documents, the name of the sender and the names of the recipients.","FIAT: The plaintiff applies for orders requiring the defendant and third parties to answer questions and respond to undertakings arising from the examinations for discovery in this action. The plaintiffs also ask for further and better disclosure of documents over which a claim for privilege is asserted. The defendant maintains that the documents referred to in the plaintiff's Reply to the Government of Saskatchewan's Demand for Particulars form part of those contracts and set out additional terms and/or set out the intentions of the defendants in entering into the contracts. The third parties deny all allegations made by the plaintiff and the defendant as a third party claimant and specifically deny that the plaintiff is entitled to judgment in any amount against the defendant. HELD: The court will not unduly restrict an examination by excluding questions broadly related to the issues that may well be resolved by other evidence not before the court on the application. The broad relevance test is test of credibility. The court reviewed the relevant authorities and found that the relevance test to the application for discovery was broad and wide. The Court found that, pursuant to the governing legislation, the third party contractors were not liable to pay PST because the cement was supplied, used and installed into the real property of the plaintiff. Further, the court found that if the third parties were liable to refund the PST to the plaintiff that was collected and levied in error by third parties, then the defendant was entitled to payment of PST from them on the cement consumed in the performance of their contracts with the plaintiff"
b_2001skqb124.txt,"The medical doctor alleged the other medical doctors owed a fiduciary duty to act in good faith with respect to their agreement to perform on-call services for the District Health Board. Under the voluntary arrangement doctors who chose not to enter the arrangement remained on-call to look after their own patients and to respond to emergencies. It worked well until Hanna established another clinic and began dividing his time between Regina and the Moosomin clinic. HELD: The actions against the doctors and health district were dismissed with taxed costs.  1)Hanna's exclusion from the roster was authored by his own conduct. When he was habitually late on his weekend on-call duties and sometimes failed to show at all, the remaining doctors set up a new on-call roster which did not include him. Such action was necessary under the bylaws governing the hospital and to provide good patient care to the hospital. He was not only remiss in performing his on-call duties but there were serious questions about his professional competence. He would admit a patient and fail to attend upon him or her for several days. Or he would fail to diagnose an obvious condition. His reasons for his failure to attend a meeting convened by the hospital administrator to resolve the problems was unacceptable. 2)There was no evidence of a legally binding contract between the doctors. The on-call arrangement was voluntary. There was no expressed intention that it be legally enforceable. 3)The common characteristics defining a fiduciary relationship were discussed in Baskerville v. Thurgood. There was no fiduciary with power over anyone and therefore no fiduciary relationship with respect to the doctors.  4)The relationship between the hospital and its doctors having privileges in the hospital is one that is defined by the Hospital Standards Act and Regulations and bylaws of the Health District. Consideration was also given to the relationship with the College of Physicians and Surgeons. A hospital is never, on the facts, in the position of a fiduciary towards its doctors. There was no basis in law or fact supporting the existence of a fiduciary relationship between Hanna and the Health District.","A medical doctor brought an action against three doctors alleging that each of them owed a duty of trust and a fiduciary duty to act towards him in good faith in connection with an arrangement entered into by all the doctors to perform the on-call services required of them by the defendant, the Pipestone District Health Board. HELD: The action was dismissed with costs to be taxed. 1)There was no law supporting the existence of a Trust or a Fiduciary relationship between the doctors and the defendant. The fact that the hospital was neither the originator of the on call arrangement introduced by the doctors nor party to it, and there were serious questions about his professional competence. 2)The relationship between hospital and its doctors, here, was not defined by the standards of the Moosomin College or any other college. Nor was it an enforceable relationship. 3)The court dismissed the action against the third doctor, Crouse, Kirsch, on the basis that it was not inconsistent with the standards set out in Moosnomin College. Neither doctor entered into a trust or a fiduary relationship with the other. Neither party was a party to the arrangement. 4)The common characteristics of a relationship between a doctor and a patient are: a class or category, or of such nature in fact, as to give rise to one of them. A relationship between doctors and patients is not defined either by Moosni College or the Saskatchewan College of Physicians."
7_2001canlii346.txt,"The Crown withdrew one count at the opening of the trial and the accused was charged with operating a motor vehicle while having a blood alcohol concentration in excess of .08 contrary to s.253(b) and s.255(1) of the Criminal Code. In issue was whether the police officer had reasonable and probable grounds to make the breath demand; whether the demand met the requirements of the sample being taken by or under supervision of a medical practioner; whether the officer actually obtained information that taking the sample would not endanger the accused's life; whether the accused gave valid consent; whether the blood samples were taken as soon as practicable; whether the Crown could rely on the certificate where there was a reasonable doubt as to whether the physician took the sample himself or supervised a technician. HELD: The accused was found guilty. There was no basis on the evidence as a whole to exclude the Certificate of Analysis, which established the accused's blood alcohol level was 1.59 at the time of driving. 1)The officer had reasonable and probable grounds when he made the demand, including the accused was in the driver's seat; the odour of alcohol; the open bottle of beer; the nature of the accident. 2)Although the medical certificate could not be accepted as proof of the facts set out therein, the Crown did prove beyond a reasonable doubt by other evidence all the matters that could have been proven by the certificate. There was a reasonable doubt as to whether the doctor addressed his mind to the facts and opinion to the truth of what he was certifying. The doctor's mind was directed to the medical needs of the patient. His evidence was based on normal practice - not specific memory. There was no other logical conclusion that either the doctor or technician took the samples. The doctor would not have given permission to take samples if there was any danger to the life or health of his patient. 3)Since the officer had reasonable and probable grounds to make a demand for a sample of blood, the accused's consent was not required. 4)The officer proceeded with all due diligence and without any necessary delay. The blood was taken within a reasonably prompt time under all the circumstances.  5)The accused's admission that the accident affected his memory of the events following it and had no recollection of having passed the other vehicle just prior and that he was not driving like he normally drove and was perhaps going too fast for the road conditions (the gravel road was a wash board but was not at its worst condition) were noted.","The accused was charged with having consumed alcohol in such a quantity that the concentration in his blood exceeded 80 milligrams of alcohol in 100 millilitres of blood contrary to s.253(b) and s.255(1) of the Criminal Code. The Crown called as witnesses the boyfriend of the accused's sister-in-law and the doctor of a civilian who at the time was an inmate. The accused testified at trial that he had had the doctor complete the wrong form for the wrong reason and that the doctor advised him that the taking of the blood would not endanger his life or health. HELD: The Crown proved beyond a reasonable doubt that the accused had acted in the best interests of his life and that he was 100% sure that the blood was taken from the accused. The Court concluded that the facts in the mind of the officer when he decided to make the demand did amount to reasonable and probable grounds for his doing so. Based on the officer's testimony that he asked the permission of the doctor to take the blood, and his evidence that he did not recall signing the second certificate, and on the evidence of other witnesses who testified that they had seen the accused in the hospital, the Court found that the officer had no reason whatsoever to taint his evidence by favouring either the Crown or the accused and there was nothing in the evidence to suggest that the Crown had proved that the Blood was actually taken by the accused or his friends. On the evidence as a whole, the Crown was left with reasonable doubt as to who actually took the blood."
d_2011skpc110.txt,"The accused was detained by a police officer at the scene following a motor vehicle accident. The police vehicle was not equipped with an approved screening device (ASD) and was requested at 3:02 a.m. Upon receiving the ASD, a demand was made for a breath sample at 3:10 a.m. and a 'fail' reading was obtained at 3:12 a.m. The accused unsuccessfully attempted to reach three different lawyers at the police station and ultimately spoke with Legal Aid duty counsel. The accused was charged with driving over .08. The defence argued that the ASD demand was not made forthwith and the ASD results were unlawfully obtained. The defence submitted the accused's rights under s. 8, s. 9, and s. 10(b) of the Charter were breached and sought exclusion of the Certificate of Analysis. HELD: 1) The accused's s. 10(b) Charter right was not infringed. While the police were obliged to afford the accused a reasonable opportunity to contact counsel and to facilitate that contact, they were not required to monitor the quality of the legal advice once contact was made. 2) Although the accused was arbitrarily detained for a period of 11 minutes from time of detention to making of the ASD demand contrary to s. 8 and s. 9 of the Charter, the officer acted in good faith by placing the accused in the police vehicle because it was cold outside, the accused had no jacket on, he was injured and his vehicle was seriously damaged. The detention was of relatively short duration and there was no evidence that the accused's bodily integrity or dignity were compromised. The admission of the Certificate of Analysis would not bring the administration of justice into disrepute.","The accused was charged with operating a motor vehicle while his blood alcohol content exceeded 80 milligrams of alcohol in 100 millilitres of blood, contrary to s. 253(1)(b) of the Criminal Code. After being detained at the police station, he attempted unsuccessfully to reach three different lawyers. Eventually, he spoke with Legal Aid duty counsel. The accused argued the admission of the Certificate of Analysis would not bring the administration of justice into disrepute as it would violate the accused's s. 10(b) Charter rights. HELD: The Court held the Charter breaches were moderately serious. The officer's reasonable suspicion that the accused had alcohol in his body when he located him in the police vehicle was not raised as part of the reasonable and probable grounds for making a demand. The Certificate of Analyses was admitted into evidence. The Court found the accused was arbitrarily detained for 11 minutes until the demand was made for a breath sample and the taking of the sample was 11 minutes because the officer was not advised of the reason for the detention. The delay was of relatively short duration compared to the 33 minutes in Hatzel, but the Court found that the officer's grounds for demanding the samples were irrelevant as the accused did not have a lawyer and had not been informed of his right to consult counsel prior to making the demand. Finally, the Court held that the certificate of analysis would not be excluded as it was a form of disclosure for the accused."
9_2005nssc297.txt,"The appellant was convicted of driving a motor vehicle while his licence was suspended. The appeal centred upon the adjudicator's acceptance of the police officer's evidence and the reliability of that evidence versus the defence witnesses who testified that the appellant's son was actually the driver of the vehicle. Appeal allowed; verdict of acquittal entered. The adjudicator erred by failing to address whether the appellant's evidence raised a reasonable doubt as to his innocence, particularly on the central issue of whether the appellant was the only person present in the vehicle. But not making a finding on this critical issue, this tended to suggest more strongly that the adjudicator engaged in an either/or analysis in accepting the evidence of the Crown's witnesses over that of the four defence witnesses; the adjudicator should have made clear findings of credibility based on the evidence before him.","The appellant appealed his conviction for driving a motor vehicle while suspended, contending that the adjudicator failed to properly interpret the provisions of s. 287(2) of the Motor Vehicle Act, and thereby failed to give the benefit of reasonable doubt to the appellant. The adjudicator also rejected the evidence of three other witnesses, a police officer and a mixed breed dog, who testified that they had seen the appellant get out of the vehicle while unlicensed. Allowing the appeal, that the conviction was unreasonable and cannot be supported by the evidence; there was insufficient evidence to prove the appellant was in fact the driver of the car; and other grounds as may appear from the record. The scope of the appellate review in summary conviction appeal is well settled. The Court of Appeal has repeatedly affirmed the importance of taking into account the special position of the trier of fact on matters of credibility. It remains open to an appellate court to overturn a verdict based on findings of credibility where, after considering all the evidence and having due regard to the advantages afforded to the trial judge, it concludes that the verdict is unreasonable."
6_2009skca97.txt,"The proposed appellants and the proposed respondent were involved in litigation involving the ownership of some valuable breeding dogs that were in the possession of the proposed respondent, but claimed by the proposed appellants. The proposed appellants sought and obtained a writ of replevin in relation to the dogs. The proposed respondent applied for an order setting aside the writ, and ordering the dogs returned. The chambers judge granted the application finding that the affidavit filed in support of the writ contained false and misleading information and that to allow the writ to stand would constitute an abuse of process. The issue on appeal is whether the chambers judge erred in inquiring into the accuracy of the facts sworn to in the proposed appellant's affidavit, in light of the provision in Rule 407(2) of the Queen's Bench Rules that provides that the validity of the writ shall not be questioned in any interlocutory proceeding where the affidavit substantially complies with the requirements of the Rule. HELD: Leave to appeal is granted. The ruling of the chambers judge raises an issue of considerable importance to the general operation of the writ of replevin as provided for in the Rules of Court.","The proposed appellants sought and obtained a writ of replevin in relation to the dogs pursuant to Queen's Bench Rules 406-10. The proposed respondent provided an irrevocable letter of credit in the amount of $12,000 as security in accordance with the requirements of Rule 408 and the sheriff seized two of the disputed dogs in her possession. She then applied to the Court of Queen’s Bench for an order setting aside the writ, and ordering the dogs to be returned to her on the grounds that the affidavit filed in support of the writ contained false and misleading information. HELD: Leave to appeal was granted.

In an application to quash committal for trial there is only one ground for action by the reviewing court and that is lack of jurisdiction. (2)Application dismissed. The conditions imposed by the Provincial Court Judge were justified. He did not err in law or in his application of the facts.,"FIAT.

The complainant was an off duty police officer who left his home and knocked on the passenger window. The accused exited the van and assaulted the complainant resulting in the complainant receiving a broken nose and ankle. The accused was charged with aggravated assault and assaulting a police officer. The accused asserted a defence of self-defence to the charge of assault and questioned whether the complainant was properly identified and acting as a police officer in the line of duty at the time of the incident. HELD: The accused was convicted of aggravated assault and acquitted of the charge of assaulting a peace officer. 1) Regardless of whether the complainant was acting in the course of his duties as a police officer, he had a lawful right to intervene to prevent the continuation of the breach of the peace he witnessed. Even if the original actions of the accused might be viewed as originally defensive in nature, he clearly used more force than was necessary to defend himself.  2) Although three of the Crown's witnesses identified that the complainant identified himself as a police officer, none of the versions of what occurred were consistent with the other. The Court was left with doubt as to whether the mens rea of assaulting police officer was proven, namely that the accused knew that the officer in question was in fact a police officer.","HELD: The Court found the accused guilty of two counts being a curfew breach and an alcohol abstention breach on his part. The Court also found that the accused had used more force than was necessary to defend himself, which takes him out of the protection afforded to him by s. 34(1) of the Criminal Code. In addition, the Court found that there was a breach of the peace because the complainant did not recognize him as a police officer. The accused was also found to have committed breach of a peace officer by striking the officer in the nose and breaking his nose."

After being clearly told that the money would not be returned, she waited 9 years before commencing the action. The plaintiff applied for an order disallowing the defendants' limitation defence. Application to disallow the limitation defence dismissed; plaintiff's action dismissed. The plaintiff's evidence did not show any valid reason for such a lengthy delay and the defendants thought that all outstanding issues with the plaintiff had long since been settled. Not only was there a presumption that the evidence would now be less cogent than it would have been, but the defendants' storage warehouse was destroyed by fire 3 years ago resulting in the loss of many old records, including those relating to the motel.","The plaintiff, through her numbered company, assumed the operation of the Maritime Motel by lease with an option to purchase. The lessor, Metro Computerized Bookkeeping, advised her that if the lease was not executed within a reasonable time, she would require the return of the security deposit.

The Court found that the defendants thought that all outstanding issues with the plaintiff had long since been settled so they had no possible reason to give any notice to the plaintiff respecting time limitations.

The Court had preferred to adjourn the discharge hearing for a period of 6 months. This would allow the Court to assess the financial circumstances of the bankrupt and her spouse at that time.

c_1999skqb209.txt,"FIAT. A defendant applied for an order pursuant to the inherent jurisdiction of the court, alternatively s.50 of the Queen's Bench Act, for an order requiring the plaintiff to be examined by a qualified psychiatrist within 30 days; requiring a report to be filed with the court as to whether the plaintiff is mentally competent to instruct his solicitor; and staying proceedings until a report is filed. The certificate of incompetence issued in December 1998 was revoked (QBG No. 690/1999) on the basis the competency examination was obtained by subterfuge (other parties had asked the plaintiff to attend a physical examination for a fictitious purpose but conducted a competency examination); there was no record of the review panel hearing; no reasons were given for the decision to uphold the certificate. The plaintiff alleged the issuance of the certificate caused mental anguish, emotional suffering, and loss of liberty and alleged conspiracy, abuse of process, breach of fiduciary duty and negligence. HELD: The application was dismissed.  1)Our civil procedure does not contemplate the trial of an issue on a person's competence to bring a lawsuit. A certificate of incompetence issued pursuant to the Act had the same effect as a finding that the person is incapable of instructing counsel or understanding legal proceedings and would result in the appointment of a litigation guardian. This step was not deemed necessary based on the evidence presented. A stay was refused.  2)Costs incurred in defending a civil action against a person who is subsequently found to be incapable of managing his or her estate are recoverable from the estate. 3)Queen's Bench Act s.50 did not apply.  4)The plaintiff was entitled to his costs in any event of the cause.","FIAT. The plaintiff sought an order pursuant to the inherent jurisdiction of the Court or alternatively s.50 of the Queen's Bench Act for an order requiring the plaintiff to be examined by a qualified psychiatrist within 30 days and requiring a report from the said psychiatrist as to whether the plaintiff is mentally competent to instruct counsel in this law suit. The applicants were reluctant to initiate the procedure to have the plaintiff undergo another mental competency examination due to this intervening law suit and the fear of being further accused of improper conduct or improper motives in doing so. HELD: The application was dismissed. 1)The Court was not obliged to take this step based on the evidence presented. The Act, despite its pejorative title, exists at this point in time solely to legislate the procedures to be followed in determining if a person is mentally incompetent to manage his or her estate. 2)There is no need for the Court to invoke its inherent jurisdiction if the remedy sought is readily available to the applicant, for the simple reason that the issuance of a certificate would result in a litigation guardian being appointed. This is not a case where it would be inappropriate that the Court should order a single examination for determination of an issue where there is no acceptable medical evidence on the issue. Rather than attempting to set down a new set of procedural safeguards for a determination of a person's mental competence to engage in civil litigation, with the inevitable time and costs associated with the trial of such an issue, it is preferable that the procedures outlined in existing legislation be resorted to for any such determination."
8_2009skqb54.txt,"FIAT: Each of the defendants and third parties (collectively the 'applicants'), apply to stay either permanently or on an interim basis the plaintiffs' claim commenced pursuant to The Class Actions Act. The stay applications seek the same discretionary order of the court pursuant to s. 37(1) of The Queen's Bench Act, 1998 and/or Rule 173 of the Queen's Bench Rules. The plaintiff's action claims damages for injuries that are alleged to have been caused by the testing and application of herbicides at a Canadian Forces base in New Brunswick. To date 11 statements of claim have been filed across Canada, 9 by Merchant Law Group (MLG). MLG has proceeded with various stages of the class action proceeding which it has commenced through the various jurisdictions in Canada as it has considered to be to the best advantage of the plaintiffs which that firm represents or seeks to represent. Now Saskatchewan is the clear preference. Many of these strategic decisions are driven by the nature of state of class actions legislation in the various jurisdictions in which claims were commenced. The applicants claim these strategic decisions are and do constitute an abuse of process. They claim they are a costly expenditure of time and money. The applicants have already participated in certification hearings in Newfoundland and New Brunswick. The issue on this application is whether the Saskatchewan action should be stayed permanently or on an interim basis with or without conditions on the basis of abuse of process. HELD: The applications to stay, on either an interim or permanent basis, the Saskatchewan action are dismissed. 1) The Court has concluded that virtually all, if not all of the concerns raised by the applicants in support of their stay applications are intended to be, and for that matter, mandated to be considered by the court during the certification application of this class action.  'Traffic control' as between the nine or ten existing class actions commenced in the other provincial jurisdictions is the responsibility of this Court upon certification as now required by s. 6(2) and s. 6(3) of the Act. The objectives and relevant factors by which the court is to be guided and which it must consider involve the very considerations upon which the applicants base their stay applications. They include avoiding, where possible, the risk of irreconcilable judgments, the promotion of judicial economy, the consideration of the law applicable, the stage each action has reached, the plan for the proposed multi-jurisdictional class action and the location of the representative plaintiffs, class members, evidence and witnesses. The discretion granted by the legislature to the court with respect to any certification orders it may issue as outlined in s. 6.1 of the Act is very broad. That discretion must be exercised having regard to the criterion set out in s. 6(2) of the Act. That may prompt a conclusion that deference should be given to an existing class action commenced in another jurisdiction. The discretion of the court is further circumscribed by the objectives and relevant factors set out in s. 6(3) of the Act. The concerns raised by the applicants in support of their stay application have been eclipsed. They are not specifically and legislatively required to be addressed by the court at the certification stage and after a certification hearing has been conducted. 2) Even if the criteria in Englund v. Pfizer Canada Inc., 2007 SKCA 62; were to be applied to the consideration of the stay applications presently before the Court, the Court would be inclined, in any event, to dismiss the stay applications in the facts and circumstances of this case. There are many differences between the proposed Saskatchewan class to be certified, its inclusiveness and exclusiveness, the nature of the injuries claims for, the substances alleged to have cause those injuries and the enumerated defendants or third parties in the actions commenced in each of the other jurisdictions. That alone, without the assistance of s. 6 and the other amending provisions of the Saskatchewan Act, distinguish this case from those criteria which the Court of Appeal applied in Englund to reach the conclusion that the action should be appropriately (but conditionally) stayed.",FIAT: The action commenced pursuant to The Class Actions Act (the Act) and is now represented by an amended Statement of Claim. The application seeks a discretionary order pursuant to s. 37(1) of the Queen's Bench Rules and/or Rule 173 of the QS Bench Rules of Court. The applicants argue that this action and these proceedings are an abuse of the court's process and that the court has the statutory and inherent jurisdiction to order the action stayed. HELD: The Court acknowledges the continuing challenges that are raised with respect to the judicial management and handling of multi-jurisdictional class actions. The Court also notes that virtually all of the concerns raised by the applicants in support of their stay applications are intended to be considered by the Court during the certification application of this class action. These concerns may be of some assistance to the Court as it is now 'no costs' jurisdiction providing for the certification of a national multi- jurisdictional class action on an 'opt-out' basis.
d_2004nssf61.txt,"The wife sought a divorce, custody, child support, a division of matrimonial assets and an order directing that the husband's equity in the matrimonial home be postponed until the youngest child reached 19 years of age. She proposed to sell the home and put the proceeds, together with a new mortgage, towards the purchase of a new home. Joint custody awarded for all four children, with the father to have primary care and control of the oldest and the mother to have primary care and control of the three younger children; the father is to pay child support for three children in the guideline amount and the mother is to pay child support for one child in the guideline amount; the husband's equity in the matrimonial home is frozen at the amount owing on the mortgage when the parties separated and his interest is postponed until the youngest child reaches the age of 21 years; if the wife wishes to obtain a new home in a new location, she will be required to pay out the husband's equity in the matrimonial home.","The petitioner sought a divorce and custody, child support and an order directing that the respondent's equity in the matrimonial home be postponed until the youngest child was 19 years old. The respondent sought to sell the home and build a new house and claimed that he was entitled because he stayed home and cared for the children throughout the marriage and lost his opportunity to enter the work force earlier. The husband argued that he would need to replace his vehicle, have a line of credit, pay child support of $25,000 and retire the septic tank at his residence. HELD: The respondent's request to postpone the child support payments was granted as a result of a permanent breakdown of the marriage was granted. The court ordered the respondent to pay $1,500 per month in child support plus $350 for orthodontic expenses and $500 for home improvement. An equal division of the assets and joint custody of the children was ordered, with the respondent having primary care and the remaining child having the right to access the children whenever they were not in school. Child support payments were to be directed to the Maintenance Enforcement Program and the respondent was to have regular monthly payments of $300 to $400 for the two youngest children and $300 per month for extracurricular activities. Although there was some strain in the relationship, this should not interfere with the petitioner's reasonable access with reasonable notice.  1)Access was ordered with costs to the respondent in the amount of $55,000 per year for the next four years to be determined by the court based on the parties' credit scores. 2)The respondent's claim for spousal support was dismissed as there was no basis for it. 3)The court was not prepared to order a further postponement of the child care expenses for the purposes of calculating special and extraordinary expenses."

The court, applying its supervisory powers, found the trustee should not be represented by the bank's counsel. On Appeal.","This was an application for an order prohibiting the law firms from acting as counsel for the Trustee of the bankrupt estate. The Trustee had been appointed by the bankrupt as custodian of its property, and as such was subject to the scrutiny of the Court. The bankrupt estate had been experiencing financial difficulties during the course of which it appointed Ernst Young as its custodian, and it had guaranteed payment of its creditors' fees and disbursements under the terms of the debenture. It sought the removal of these counsels. The respondent acknowledged that there are areas of potential conflict with the interests of both the trustee and the bank, but argued that to order the trustee to retain other counsel would create a great financial burden because of the time required by new counsel to acquaint itself with information already in the knowledge of present counsel. In his dissenting opinion, the Court found that the mere existence of a claim by a creditor as against the petitioning creditor could not per se be grounds for removing counsel. It also referred to a Supreme Court of Canada decision in MacDonald Estate v. Martin Rossmere Holdings (1990), which held that if a bankrupt asks a trustee to take an action against him or her, the trustee must be mindful of the relationships between the parties and not be in a position where it could appear that the trustee is influenced by the Bank in making that decision."

The plaintiff claimed the creditor wrongfully converted monies after a full and final settlement of his account for a lesser sum ($2,000 on a $15,600 account). He sought punitive damages for 'high-handed and malicious behaviour'. The plaintiff assigned his future crop insurance benefits and Canadian Wheat Board payments for application to his outstanding account in May 2001. In June 2001 a farmhand had an accident, while operating his employer's unlicensed vehicle. An occupant of the other vehicle in the accident was critically injured and died. The defendant says it was subsequently induced to settle the debt for a lesser sum by the plaintiff's false representation that SGI was suing him for between $200,000 and $300,000; that he would be found liable and would likely make an assignment in bankruptcy, making the account uncollectible. SGI initiated proceedings against the plaintiff in May 2002 claiming $17,660. The defendant contended that, if there was an accord and satisfaction, it was avoided due to mistake of fact or misrepresentation. HELD: The application for summary judgment was dismissed.

9_2002skpc30.txt,"The Crown applied for three DNA warrants pursuant to s.487.05 of the Criminal Code. Each of the three Informations sworn by an RCMP officer alleged the accused and his 19 year old daughter committed incest contrary to s.155, and a 7 month old child was born as a result. The Informations deposed that the Crown had obtained a DNA sample of the person who claimed to be the natural mother of the 19 year old.HELD: 1)No case was found dealing was a similar application regarding a possible charge under s.155. The words of s.487.05 were analyzed to determine its proper meaning and interpretation. 'Bodily substances' is not defined in the general definition s.2 nor the DNA definition s.487.04 of the Criminal Code. Assuming, without deciding, that it is proper to conclude that the child is a victim, there has been no bodily substance found or obtained from the child or from anyone else, and accordingly no portion of s.487.05(1)(b) is applicable. Subparagraphs 487.05(1)(b)(ii), (iii) and (iv) all refer to a bodily substance found or obtained on or within the body of a victim or some other person involved with the offence; 487.05(1)(b)(i) and (iv) refer to bodily substances found or obtained at or related to the place where the offence was committed. Nothing in s.487.05 suggests that a blood sample of a child born of an alleged incestuous relationship, which is not in the possession of the Crown and remains in the child, is a bodily substance found or obtained within the meaning of s.487.05(1)(a). 2)There were numerous deficiencies in the Informations. The paragraphs did not set out the basis or source of the officer's information, the relationship of the parties to the named informant, nor why the information was considered reliable. There should be some indication as to how the DNA analysis will establish that the adult male is the natural father and how it will negative any suggestion that the parents of the baby are 'strangers' genetically speaking. The qualifications of the RCMP officer who will take the blood samples and of the corporal who trained him should be set out. The paragraphing format was confusing. 3)A DNA warrant application would be premature. The custodial parent or parents are in the legal position of being the persons who can give informed consent to the taking of the baby's blood. It may be appropriate at some point to order a sample be obtained. It was questionable whether it was in the best interests of the administration of justice to make such an order now.","The Crown applied pursuant to s. 487.05 of the Criminal Code for DNA warrants to obtain blood samples from the male, the female and the child. The Informations in Support were sworn by an RCMP officer. Each alleges that a middle-aged man and his 19-year old daughter have committed incest, and that child, now months old, has been born as result of the incestuous relationship. The applications depose that the Crown has obtained a DNA sample from the person who says she is the mother (herein 'the natural mother' of the 19- year old female) and that the DNA of the baby is not linked in any satisfactory fashion to the alleged father. There is nothing from the natural mother positively stating that no other person could be the father of the fetus. This statement should ordinarily be included. The Court was of the view that a DNA warrant application with respect to the baby would be premature, but may be renewed in due course if the Crown is advised. The proper inference to be drawn from the present applications is that a warrant may be issued when some substance such as saliva, semen, hair, blood or like product produced by or carried by the victim at the time of the offence was committed. There was nothing from either of the parties who could give an informed consent, instruct counsel, or otherwise avail itself of the information required to be provided pursuant s.485(1)(b) of the Code. The custodial parent or parents are in the legal position of being the persons who can give informed consent to the taking of the child's blood. The natural mother has had no timely association whatever with the alleged offence. It is questionable whether it could be concluded at present that it was in the best interests of the administration of justice to make such an order. Application respecting the month old child The conclusions reached after analyzing each subparagraph individually are reinforced by the fact that the RCMP officer who will take the blood samples has a certificate or any similar qualification, nor is the qualification of the corporal who trained him set out. In and of themselves, these deficiencies would probably not preclude issuance of a warrant. The Crown must provide some basic evidence which can satisfy the court that the technician or expert who will carry out DNA procedures is properly qualified to do so."
e_2007skqb179.txt,"Application for judicial review of a board of arbitration award that held the First Nations University of Canada had violated certain provisions of a collective agreement in force between the parties. The grievance alleged that the University had interfered with faculty member's academic freedom. The allegation concerned the withdrawal of an invitation to that faculty member to be the keynote speaker at National Symposium on Post Secondary Education Policy and Funding that was held on campus, although the University was not directly involved. After one of the chief organizers examined the faculty member's thesis and determined it would not provide suitable foundation for the symposium's keynote address, the invitation was withdrawn. The faculty member sought to have the decision reversed, and requested the University's Board of Governors' intervention. When the faculty member's request came up at one of the Board's meetings, one of its members made some inappropriate comments and expressed personal animus towards the faculty member. No decision was reached at that meeting. The respondent Board of Arbitration found that, in failing in his obligation to refrain from interfering in and to defend the academic freedom of a faculty member, the Board member's comportment amounted to a violation of the collective agreement by the employer. The applicant argued that the Board of Arbitration exceeded its jurisdiction by entertaining a grievance that did not involve parties to the collective agreement. Further, it argued that the Board of Arbitration made a determination of an issue not raised in the grievance, namely, a finding that there was a violation of academic freedom. HELD: The application is dismissed with costs. The Board of Arbitration found that the member of the University's Board of Governors' comportment at the meeting did not accord with the requirements of certain articles of the collective agreement. The reasons of the Board of Arbitration support that finding and the decision meets the reasonableness test. The fact that the member of the Board of Governors was acting in his capacity as Chair brought the issue within the purview of the collective agreement. The Court disagrees with the applicant's contention that the Board of Arbitration made a determination of an issue not raised in the grievance directly.","This is an application for judicial review of a Board of Arbitration Award which held that the First Nations University of Canada had violated certain provisions of a Collective Agreement in force between the parties. The facts of the case are reasonably straightforward. The applicant is a First Nations faculty member and the grievance alleged that the University had interfered with his academic freedom. The allegation had to do with the withdrawal of an invitation to the applicant to be the keynote speaker at a conference held in mid-March. The respondent had received his Ph.D. from the University of Regina but believed he was being invited to present the results of research he had done for an Assembly of First Nations national First Nations political organization. In any event, there is no disputing the applicant's claim that he was invited to speak at the symposium, but the reasons as a whole support that finding. The decision meets the reasonableness test. HELD: The application is dismissed with costs.  1) Before passing upon the merits of the application it is necessary to determine the standard of review to be applied to the decision of the Board of Governors. Since the Supreme Court of Canada decision in Voice Construction Ltd. v. Construction General Workers' Union (2004 SCC 23) the law in this regard has been reasonably well settled. Following the pragmatic and functional approach referred to in the judgment, it is clear the Standard of Review to be apply in this case is one of reasonability. 2) In this case the applicant failed in his obligation to refrain from interfering in and to defend the academic freedom of a faculty member. 3) There is no question that the applicant violated the collective agreement. However, the Board made a clear finding of fact that the alleged breach of the Collective Agreement occurred while the applicant was acting in his capacity as Chair of the University's Board and not as an officer of the Federation. That finding brought the issue within the purview of the Agreement. 4) The formal grievance specifically refers to interference with the respondent's academic freedom in the second paragraph under the heading NATURE OF DISPUTE. These actions by FNUC and its Board have interfered with the academic liberty of this faculty member, in violation of the FNUC/URFA Academic Collective Bargaining Agreement (2002-2005).

By agreed statement of facts and issue, the parties have agreed that the issue to be determined is whether the Bank has priority to, or entitlement to, the equipment subject to the Lease. This requires a determination of whether the Lease was a 'lease for a term of more than one year' as defined by s. 2(1)(y) of The Personal Property Security Act. HELD: The respondent was 'regularly engaged in the business of leasing', within the meaning of s. 2(1)(y)(iv) of the PPSA and therefore is not entitled to the exemption from registration requirements of s. 3 of the Act. The lease in question was therefore 'a lease for a term of more than one year' within the meaning of the Act and it required registration. Having failed to register its leasehold interest at the personal property registry, the respondent's claim to the equipment is subordinate to the registered and first priority claim of the Bank. 1) There is no evidence of any business activity at all that the respondent engaged in until May 2001 when it had transferred back to it Sweeprite's land, building and equipment. The respondent in turn rented back the building, land and equipment, none of which ever left Sweeprite's possession, to Sweeprite under the terms of non-written agreement. Sweeprite paid rental to the respondent. Ultimately the respondent and Sweeprite entered into the equipment lease for term of years. 2) In 2001 when the non-written lease/rental agreement first began, the respondent had no other business except the ownership and lease to and/or rental of the land, building and equipment to Sweeprite. It was not until December of 2001 when it obtained the research and development contract with Rite Way. 3) The business of leasing, which had started in the spring of 2001 under the non-written arrangement and which continued thereafter by virtue of the equipment lease until the bankruptcy of Sweeprite, was from May to December of 2001 the only business of the respondent and thereafter continued to be a significant part of the respondent's business.","The Bank of Montreal (the Bank) presents a motion to the Court to determine the priority position of the Bank and the respondent Patchrite (Patchrite) respecting assets leased by the Bank. The applications are brought pursuant to ss. 63 and 66 of The Personal Property Security Act.

The lease in question was therefore 'a lease for a term of more than 1 year' within the meaning of the PPSA and it required registration. 2) The Court concludes that the lease was a lease for more than one year and it is entitled to registration.

The move is justified because the petitioner is the only parent available to the children and it would defy common sense to deprive the children of a relationship with their new sibling, particularly when the respondent is unavailable as a parent and there is no reasonable basis to conclude that matters can be resolved in the father's favour. The respondent asked to have the issue of custody and access delayed until his release. This is not a realistic option. It was clear that the father had not truly considered the best interests of his children in opposing this application and that the mother's position would likely prevail at trial. With respect to access with the father in jail, there was no evidence that visiting the respondent in jail would be beneficial to these young children. The respondent was granted telephone access and, if it was possible to arrange with corrections officials, access via Skype or Face Time.","FIAT: This is a high-conflict family law matter. The mother wants to change her residence (and that of the two children) presently. The father has a significant history of criminal behaviour, is presently incarcerated and will be for at least the balance of this year and beyond. The parties married in 2008 and separated in 2011. Two years ago the mother unilaterally moved with the children to Kenaston, notwithstanding an existing order of this court. She has formed a new relationship and she is pregnant. While the father has been in jail for a number of criminal matters, he was sentenced in October. His latest affidavit is not entirely clear on how long he will be in jail, but states he is eligible for early release in December 2013. These are fact-intensive and there is no presumption in favour of the present custodial parent. The children have access with their father while he is incarcerated. This matter has not gone to trial and is far from concluded. However, the mother's willingness (or lack of same) to ensure a connection between the children and their father may well be a factor in her remaining the primary parent. HELD: The court ordered the children have telephone access to their father every three weeks, as may be arranged, until he is released from custody. The telephone access shall be converted accordingly. 1)It appears beyond dispute that the mother has always been the primary caregiver to the children. There is nothing suggesting the two boys have anything other than a close and loving relationship with her. While personal access to an incarcerated parent may be beneficial to children in some instances, the court has insufficient evidence to conclude, on a balance of probabilities, that these two young children visiting their father in jail would benefit. 2)There should be some connection maintained. That can be done through telephone access. As well, the parties should explore with corrections authorities the prospect of communication through Skype, FaceTime or one of the other means of electronic audio/visual communication. Some form of monitoring might be possible."

He deposited a security deposit and rent in his personal account and used it for personal living expenses. When the owner inquired, he caused a false lease to be provided to her showing the rental commencing two months later than it actually did; he then failed to remit some rent and was late remitting other rent. He entered into a settlement with the owner after she complained to the Real Estate Commission but misled and did not cooperate with the Commission. At the discipline hearing, his evidence was found not credible. The Committee gave a written decision outlining the reasons for finding him guilty of five counts of professional misconduct, but failed to provide reasons for the sanctions imposed, which included a two year licence suspension and hearing costs of $10,000. The realtor appealed both the findings of professional misconduct and the sanctions imposed. Applying the standard of review of reasonableness, appeal from the findings of misconduct dismissed; applying the standard of review of correctness, appeal granted on the issue of the sanctions imposed; matter remitted back to the Committee for reconsideration, based on the principles of sanctioning outlined in the decision. It is patently unreasonable and contrary to the principles of natural justice and fair play for an administrative board not to give reasons for its decisions; reasons must be sufficiently clear, precise and intelligible as to set out the reasoning process of the tribunal and demonstrate a consideration of all of the relevant factors.","A licensed realtor appeals the finding of unprofessional conduct made by a discipline sub-committee of the Nova Scotia Real Estate Commission and the sanctions imposed, including a two year license suspension and order to pay costs of $9,980.08. The Court found that the complete inadequacy of the explanation of the suspension, and the absence of any explanation for the imposition of the other sanctions, fails to meet the standards placed on the Committee. The Committee's decision was quickly made which did not reflect the time needed to consider the totality of the evidence presented. The Commission erred in law by having no juristic basis to apply such a harsh and severe penalty."
e_2002nssc20.txt,"The applicant operated commercial private billiards club with liquor licence and served bar food. The applicant applied to amend the liquor licence to another category to allow public access and slightly longer hours of operation. The Municipality refused to issue a letter to the effect that the premises were properly zoned for that purpose, arguing that the proposal would result in a change in use requiring a development agreement. The applicant applied for an order declaring that the land use by-law permitted the proposed use. Application granted; the proposal did not constitute a change in use as the essential use of the premises was the sale of liquor and food in a pool hall and that would not change. There was no evidence that the proposal would result in a nuisance or increased traffic, neither of which could be presumed.","The applicant sought an order declaring that the land use by-law of the respondent permits the operation of a licensed billiard club open to the public. The applicant had a special premises liquor license which allowed the sale of liquor, subject to certain restrictions including the following: 4) this license was for the use of members of the club only and not the general public; and 5) no advertising of the availability of liquor service was permitted. The change in the liquor license sought by the applicant would only have the effect of moving the applicant's use from one subcategory of drinking establishment to another. The club's use was not a 'change in use' as it was not defined in either the By-law or the Municipal Government Act. A development agreement was required."

Immediately after the appointment of the receiver, the supplier presented a written demand for repossession of the books. The receiver refused, claiming that the books were subject to an agreement for sale to the institution's students and therefore, exempt.  A judge of the Supreme Court agreed and the supplier appealed. Appeal allowed; return of books or payment of their value to the supplier ordered. Although the goods were supplied as course materials, the institution's contract with its students obliged it to provide, in its discretion, textbooks and courseware needed for the program and the students acknowledged that it was necessary for the institution to change materials from time to time. The books had not been distributed to the students as of the date of the supplier's demand. The fact that the institution intended to supply certain materials did not give rise to a contractual obligation to provide these particular materials. Thus, the books were not subject to any agreement for resale within the meaning of the Act.","This was an appeal by a supplier from the refusal by a receiver to release goods to the supplier pursuant to s. 81.1 of the Bankruptcy and Insolvency Act. The single issue was whether the judge erred in finding that the goods were subject to an agreement for sale at arms' length at the time the supplier presented a written demand for repossession. The fact that it intended to supply certain materials did not give rise to a contractual obligation to provide those materials. It follows that, as of the date of the supplier's demand, these books were not'subject to any agreement for Sale' within the meaning of s.81.1(1)(c)(v).

4_2014skqb177.txt,"Civil Procedure – Pleadings – Statement of Claim – Striking OutCivil Procedure – Queen’s Bench Rule 7-9 The plaintiffs commenced an action against the defendants that included three causes of action: a claim against Xtreme Mining and Banga for wrongful dismissal; a claim for defamation brought against Banga; and for inducing breach of contract against Potash Corp. The defendants, Xtreme and Banga, brought an application pursuant to Queen’s Bench rules 7-9(1), (2), and 13-8 for an order that portions of the statement of claim be struck out as immaterial. The plaintiffs included in their pleadings regarding the first cause of action paragraphs that described the details of the plaintiff Bell’s business and real property, which he owned before he was hired by the applicants. Regarding the plaintiff’s pleadings respecting the second cause of action, they included details of the plaintiff Bell’s health condition at the time he was dismissed from employment. The plaintiffs pleaded a description of the contents of a meeting between them, Banga and his legal counsel in connection with the second cause, which, if proven, would establish that the plaintiffs were not responsible for acts of intimidation and that the defendants dismissed the plaintiffs for an improper and malicious purpose. The facts were material to the issue of wrongful dismissal and defamation. The other paragraphs that were considered immaterial by the applicants dealt with remarks made by Banga to the media. HELD: The court dismissed the application with respect to the plaintiffs’ pleadings about the plaintiff’s prior business and health condition. Similarly, the plaintiffs’ pleadings with regards to the meeting were not struck, nor were the paragraphs related to the reporting in the media as the plaintiffs were not certain of the exact words used by the defendant, and therefore could not draft anything at that time. It allowed the application respecting the pleadings that related to an individual who was not a party and struck the paragraphs in question as irrelevant and immaterial.","The plaintiffs commenced an action against the defendants, Xtreme Mining & Demolition and Leonard Banga. The plaintiffs brought three causes of action and claimed damages over and above what might be referred to as normal damages. The defendants were alleged to have induced the plaintiff to abandon his previous employment and sought damages for actions that amounted to defamation. The plaintiff alleged that the defendants were using the contents of this statement of claim in an attempt to prove their allegation that the defendant had defamed them and their evidentiary facts contrary to prevailing Canadian jurisprudence. The applicants sought the following relief: 1) Rule 13-8 of the Queen's Bench Rules provides for the striking of portions of the paragraphs that appear to be plead facts. 2) Rule 7-9 is similar to former Rule 139(1) of the former Rule 173 which provides in part that a pleading or other document is to be struck. These facts are material to the plaintiffs' case as they are necessary to adequately define the nature of the action and to any moral damages flowing from it. 3) The defendants plead facts which, if proven, would establish they were fully aware that the plaintiffs were in no way responsible for any acts of intimidation and harassment and that they dismissed the plaintiffs for an improper and malicious purpose. As such, they are irrelevant to the plaintiff's action in defamation. 4) The pleadings do not offer assistance as to why the plaintiff says it legally matters. 5) The paragraphs contain references to members of the Hells Angels Motorcycle Club which would lead reasonable people to believe that the plaintiff is referring to them. 6) The statements of media outlets reproduced at para. 67(a), (c) and (d) describe the alleged defamatory statements with sufficient certainty, clarity and precision to the defendants ought to be fully equipped to respond. 7) Ibid."
c_2009nssc180.txt,"At issue was retroactive maintenance for the now 16-year-old for a period of time pre-dating the mother's application (in 2007). Although the parties separated in 2001, there was no written agreement/order in place until 2009. The father paid support voluntarily, at an amount that was increased over the years. The mother said the father controlled the amount and knew it was below his table obligation under the Guidelines. She claimed she did not know his true income, and that every time she asked for additional assistance (such as a contribution to extraordinary expenses) he told her he could not afford it. The father said he was unaware of the correct table amount, and that he paid according to the mother's demands. Retroactive support awarded according to the table amount from 2005 onward. The father's hardship arguments rejected. He was aware from the outset that his child support obligation was related to his income. The dramatic increase to his income, and his failure to disclose it to the mother in 2005 constituted sufficient/effective notice that his payments were now deficient. Claim for retroactive s. 7 (extraordinary or special) expenses for the same time-period denied. The father did, on occasion voluntarily contribute to these expenses. During the relevant period of time, the parents spent some time trying to reconcile and acting as a family.","The mother sought an order for child maintenance retroactive to the date of their separation. Prior to the consent order, there was no written agreement or court order dealing with child maintenance. The father had made overtures to the mother for increased child maintenance but had refused to provide any additional amount. The mother applied for relief pursuant to the Maintenance and Custody Act in October 2007. Consent Order dated January 9, 2009 provided relief to almost all of the issues raised in the proceeding, including ongoing child maintenance beginning January 4, 2008. What remains for decision is what responsibility, if any, the father has to retroactively provide child maintenance since the couple separated in 2001 up to the end of 2007. The federal regime appears to have contemplated limiting the recipient parent's request for information about the father's income to a three-year period. There is agreement as to the status of the child that the current child maintenance award will apply to the years 2005, 2006 and 2007. HELD: 1) The mother has a responsibility to provide child support to the father on a retroactive basis. This responsibility lies with the father. He has failed to provide sufficient notice to the recipient that his child support obligations are being met when (s)he knows that they are not. This failure to provide income in accordance with the Guidelines should be corrected from the date the child was born. 2) The father's dramatic increase in salary was sufficient notice his child maintenance obligation had to be increased. He did, on occasion, make additional payments with regard to some of the items put forward by the mother. His request for retroactive award is denied. 3) The parents have an obligation to provide support to their son pursuant to s. 7 of the Guidelines. The Father's Responsibility to Provide Child Support in the Year 2005/06 is granted by the Court of Appeal with respect to child maintenance payable by the father for the child beginning January 1, 2007 and continuing to December 2008. The current order requires payment of $687.00 month. It is not ordered that the father retroactively pay child maintenance for the year 2006/07 but rather that he retroactively provides child support for his son in the years 2007/08 and beyond. This is an important step in the process. The Court would ask the applicant to prepare the order."

The court found that the evidence found through temporary Internet sites was admissible. The reason for obtaining the warrant was apparently abandoned by the police at the beginning of the search of the computer. The police had no authority to search the computer generally. They were only authorized to look at the Internet history. The search of the non-Internet history was a serious infringement of the accused’s s. 8 Charter right. The temporary files created as a result of the visits on the Internet was evidence of Internet history, and because of this connection, this evidence was not excluded.","HELD: The accused applied to exclude certain evidence discovered by the police during the execution of a search of his computer and cellular phone. The initial determination of whether there had been a violation of the accused's s. Charter rights occurred by the judgment dated January 3, 2017. The issue of exclusion of evidence pursuant to s. 24(2) of the Charter was not determined at that time. The trial resumed on February 6, 2017 with the Crown presenting all of its evidence. The results of the seizure were marked as exhibits for identification. The accused sought to exclude all of the images of child pornography located on his computer. He argued that this was the limit set forth in the warrant and, on that basis, its admission would bring the administration of justice into disrepute. The Court rejected the application on the basis that there was no evidence presented of either the nature of the evidence seized nor the location from which it was seized. HELD: Appeal dismissed. 1)It is difficult to imagine a more intrusive invasion of privacy than the search of one's home and personal computer. Computers often contain our most intimate correspondence. They contain the details of our financial, medical, and personal situations. They even reveal our specific interests, likes, and propensities, recording in the browsing history and cache files the information we seek out and listen to on the Internet. 2)There is no evidence to suggest either officer looked for, or even considered looking for, a picture of someone who might be the complainant. They simply did not look for a specific picture to attempt to either provide independent evidence or to provide evidence to further corroborate the complainant's allegations. This is so, apparently, despite the assertion Sgt. Kuan was specifically advised by Cst. Logan of the possible presence of picture of the complainant on the accused’s computer. 3)The Court found that the search for child pornography was inexorably and inexactly directed by the Crown to the conclusion this was a case to obtain and obtain child pornography. It was not possible to devise a reasonable course of investigation based on the evidence collected. 4)The court found that, on balance, the admission of evidence obtained by a Charter breach would bring to the Administration of justice a negative consequence. It is therefore difficult to conceive a s. breach with greater impact on the Charter-protected privacy interests than occurred in this case. 5)The personal nature of all the information on the computer was emphasized by the Court as a factor to be weighed: the negative impact of admission of"
c_1994canlii4958.txt,"The Plaintiff rented a paint sprayer from the Defendant. He accidentally injected one of his fingers with paint. The finger had to be amputated. He commenced these proceedings against the Defendant seeking damages for a failure to warn him of the danger associated with the use of the paint sprayer. HELD: Judgment for the Plaintiff.  1)The paint sprayer was of the 'airless' type. It operated at 2,500 lbs. pressure. This would not have been appreciated by the ordinarily prudent user. The Defendant therefore had a duty to warn. 2)The Defendant could not escape liability because the sprayer had been rented from a location owned and operated by an independent contractor. Where an enterprise or activity is inherently dangerous, the duty to warn can not be delegated. In such a situation the party who retains the independent contractor remains vicariously liable. 3)The waiver in the rental contract was ineffective. It was a standard form agreement signed on its face with the terms of the contract on the reverse. 4)The Plaintiff was awarded general damages of $10,000.00, $5,000.00 for loss of earning capacity and recovered $3,789.50 for SHSP. 5)The usual increase in general damages for inflation and pre-judgment interest were both reduced because the Plaintiff had not presecuted his action expeditiously.","The plaintiff rented paint sprayer from a shop which was owned by the defendant. He signed a form of agreement and was told how to clean the gun part of the sprayer after completion of the work. No warning was given respecting any hazards in using the sprayers, and no warning was printed on the agreement. At issue was the defendant's liability forfailure to warn the plaintiff of the danger in using anairless paint sprayers. The plaintiff suffered a partial loss of an index finger when he inadvertently placed his finger in front of the nozzle. He sought to retain as much of the finger as possible, claiming loss of income, past and future. HELD: The plaintiff was awarded judgment for $18,789 plus $5,000 plus costs and pre-judgment interest. 1)The non-pecuniary damage issue was uncomplicated. An ordinary user of this sprayer would not appreciate the disastrous consequences of his failing to take adequate precautions to protect himself and his property. 2)Given the plaintiff's unique situation and the fact that he was unable to function at his job for about 3 months after the amputation and required an extra man to help him with the painting project, the plaintiff was not entitled to the benefit of inflation for all the years 1989 to 1994 because there was noexcuse for dragging on this minimal damage action for six years. Had the claim been adjudicated in timely fashion, only a few years of inflation would have intervened."

The caretaker confirmed the tenants endured a protracted plumbing problem and restriction on bathroom use in the apartment. The hearing officer awarded the tenants half of the actual moving cost and 1 year of rent abatement. The landlord appealed the hearing officer's decision. The landlord alleged that he was not given the opportunity to be heard or to adequately respond to the tenants' claim as he received inadequate notice and alleged that the award of damages was unreasonable. HELD: The landlord's appeal was dismissed. 1) The tenant gave notice of his claim by two separate documents and the landlord showed no misapprehension of the tenants' position based on his written response. The landlord did not indicate in his letter that the caretaker had a limited role and the landlord could have sought an adjournment but did not.  2) Section 70(6)(c) of the Act empowers the hearing officer to order payment of damages where the hearing officer considers it just and equitable. The wording of this provision is broad and unconstrained excepting that the nature of damages that may be imposed must not be punitive.

Lanson loaned Nickel $16,000 to purchase a mobile home and registered their financing statement giving them a security interest in the mobile home. The trial judge found that Lanson knew that Nickel would either rent or sell the home but that upon a sale Nickel would repay the loan in full. Nickel sold the home but did not disclose the sale to Lanson. The purchaser, SP Trucking, did not require financing and did not search the Personal Property Registry. SP Trucking sold the home to Rempel who obtained financing from the Credit Union which registered a financing agreement claiming a security interest in the home and its proceeds. Lanson attempted to seize the home. The trial judge found Lanson's security interest continued and took priority over that of the Credit Union as Lanson had not authorized the sale to the trucking company and that Lanson had no interest in releasing the security interest until he received payment in full.  HELD: 1)Section 28(1) reiterates the common law principle of nemo dat quod non habet. The debtor's right to deal with collateral is subject to the security interest granted to the creditor unless certain things occur- ie. the secured party authorized expressly or by implication the dealing with the security. 2)The trial judge was in error in finding the secured party, Lanson, had to authorize the buyer, SP Trucking, to deal with the property and that the buyer must know of the authorization. Section 28(1) does not contemplate an authorization to a third party to deal with the collateral. The fundamental issue was whether the authorization was subject to the pre-condition of payment in full. 3)The authorization to sell must be given before the sale. Lanson clearly gave Nickel express authority to deal with the security which would include resale. The fact the debtor failed to pay the secured creditor did not invalidate the sale to the buyer.  4)Canadian Commercial Bank is restricted to cases where the secured party agrees with the buyer to release the security interest on the express condition that the obligation is satisfied in full and makes it clear to the debtor he does not intend to rely simply on the proceeds. There is a distinction between a conditional authorization and an authorized sale subject to conditions that the proceeds be remitted to the secured party. 5)The trial judge clearly found that Lanson authorized the dealing. It followed that the security interest did not continue in the collateral and the title passed to the buyer. The Credit Union acquired the collateral free of the security interest of Lanson and Lanson's rights against Nickle were restricted to the proceeds.  6)By declining to deal with the matter of s30(2), the appellate court was not to be taken as approving of the reasons of the trial judge. 7)The appellant was awarded costs on double Column V.","The issue on this appeal is the priority of security interest in a mobile home granted by the respondent to the applicant and subsequent purchaser for value, the Saskatchewan Valley Credit Union having regard to the operation of s. 28(1) and s. 30(2) of The Personal Property Security Act, 1993. The facts are not in dispute and are fully set out in the judgment of the trial judge. The trial judge found that the respondent, the secured party, had to authorize the buyer to deal with the security and that the buyer must know of the authorization. HELD: The appellant was awarded costs in the usual way of double column V. The Court of Appeal is not seeking to take the position of the Credit Union based on the reasons of this trial judge but is seeking to find priorities as between the parties. The appellant's rights against Nickle are restricted to the proceeds. The Credit Union appeals. The issue on the appeal is reduced to whether the respondent authorized the sale of the security, the mobile home and its proceeds and whether the authorization is subject to the pre-condition of payment in full.  1) Section 28 of the PPSA contemplates the secured creditor (the lanson) authorizing the debtor to dealwith the security. That dealing would include resale. The fact the debtor failed to pay a secured creditor does not invalidate the sale to the buyer. 2) The appellant relied heavily on Canadian Commercial Bank v. Tisdale Farm Equipment Ltd. (Cuming and Wood, Saskatchewan and Manitoba, 1994) for a comparison of conditional authorization and authorization and an authorized sale subject to conditions that the proceeds be remitted to a secured party. At trial it was found that Lanson did not authorize the sale, the express condition that the security interest would only be released on payment of the entire proceeds in circumstances where all parties, including the vendor the purchaser and the holder of the secure interest, had knowledge of the Security interest. That is not the case here. Canadian commercial Bank is restricted to cases where the secured partner agrees with the purchaser to release the security in full and makes it clear to the debtor that he does not intend to rely simply on the proceeds; there is a distinction between conditional authorization ( conditional authorization) and an authorization (e.g. allowing a Credit Union to acquire the security), and a conditional sale(e). Both are conditional in nature. Both are subject to conditional conditions. The credit union appealed."

HELD: 1)The affidavit evidence was insufficient to determine income. 2)The respondent was to impute 15% of the capital cost allowance claimed on personal property to the applicant pursuant to s19 in each of the above years. 3)The applicant had appropriately deducted expenses from her gross income as she had deducted a portion of her home and vehicle expenses; that portion which is attributable to her business. The applicant's average income for those three years, that is her income for the purposes of calculating s.7 expenses is $32,243. That is the respondent's income for purposes of determining child support according to the tables."
9_1994canlii4999.txt,"PCL applied for an interlocutory injunction restraining the members of the Defendant unions from picketing the entrance to a construction site at which PCL was constructing an addition to the City's sewage treatment plant. The picketers were completely blocking the entrance to the construction site, were threatening the occupants of vehicles using the entrance and damaged one vehicle as it entered the site. No City employees were working on the site. ISSUES: 1)Is the picketing secondary picketing? 2)Is the manner of picketing unlawful in any event? HELD: Application allowed. 1)Picketing of the premises of an employer, where there is no direct dispute between him and the picketers or between him and his employees, is secondary picketing, is per se unlawful and cannot be jusified merely because the picketers are engaged in a legal strike against another employer who has business relations with the employer being picketed. 2)If the court had determined that the subject picketing was not secondary picketing, then, in the particular circumstances it would still have held that the subject picketing was unlawful, and ought to be restrained, as, on the whole of said evidence it was satisfied that the applicant had established that said picketing was not being carried on for the purpose of lawful communication, but, rather, was being carried on in a manner designed to obstruct, impede and interfere with the lawful performance by the applicant of its construction contract on the construction site.",The plaintiff sought an injunction restraining the defendants from engaging in secondary picketing on the premises of their employer. The picketers were obstructing the entrance to the employer's premises for up to 20 minutes and some of the employees were prevented from entering the premises for more than an hour. HELD: 1)The acts complained of were illegal and had caused and continue to cause loss and damage to the plaintiff including damage of the plaintiff's business. 2)The defendants were granted leave to file and serve materials. 3)The injunction would continue until the trial of the alleged acts. 4)The plaintiff was ordered to pay costs. 5)The court was unable to find a clear and unequivocal precedent for this principle in any of the numerous decisions at all relevant to the question.
5_2008nspc12.txt,"A youth was arrested and charged with possession of a stolen motor vehicle after the vehicle arrived near the location of a pre-arranged drug transaction. The youth was later charged with possession for the purposes of trafficking after a strip search conducted at the police station resulted in a quantity of crack cocaine being removed from his underwear. A voir dire was held to determine the lawfulness of the strip search and the admissibility of the cocaine seized. The evidence is admissible; there was no breach of s. 8 of the Charter and, in the event that there had been a breach of s.8, the admission of the evidence would not bring the administration of justice into disrepute. The strip search was incident to arrest and conducted in a reasonable manner, being reasonably quick and non-invasive. There is nothing in the Youth Criminal Justice Act or the common law which requires that young persons be afforded the opportunity to consult with counsel or a parent or guardian prior to a search. This was real evidence, the admission of which would not affect trial fairness; any breach was conducted in good faith; the search was motivated by a sense of urgency; and significant efforts were made to respect the privacy and personal integrity of the young person.","The accused was charged with having in his possession, crack cocaine, contrary to s. 5(2) of the Controlled Drugs and Substances Act. A voir dire held to determine the lawfulness of the strip search of the accused and the admissibility of 17.8 grams of crack cocaine found on the young person. The police had earlier determined that the accused would be held overnight and taken to court the following day to be arraigned on a charge of possession of stolen vehicle. The accused had placed a call to a drug transaction and arranged for someone to meet him at an agreed upon location to complete the drug transaction. The officer told the accused that he could get the vehicle back by arranging a drug deal. At the time of the call, the accused said that the officer told him that the drugs were in his underwear and that he pulled them out of his underwear. The young person was not made aware of the fact that the search was conducted for the purpose of finding drugs, nor was it specifically related to the reasons for the arrest itself. However, significant efforts were made to respect the privacy and personal integrity of the youth person and emphasize enhanced procedural protection to ensure that young persons are treated fairly and that their rights, including their right to privacy, are protected. The strip search, conducted as a part of the trial proper, was conducted to preserve evidence and to prevent the loss or destruction of drugs. Although the time period estimated by the police at around 30 seconds, that time span appeared to encompass the time from when the arrestee removed clothing and remove the drugs from the underwear to the time that they were removed from his underwear, even by the accused's account. The time period calculated by the court was approximately 15 minutes. The search was motivated by a degree of urgency and in a way that ensured the loss of drugs, prevented their destruction, and prevented their dissemination in the jail setting or at the courthouse. The evidence heard on the voir-dire did not rest on the presumption that the evidence should be excluded from the evidence. Rather, it was the youth's recollection of the conversation with the officer that led him to conclude that the officers had conducted a 'pat-down' search. The youth was not aware that the presence of drugs in the vehicle associated with the trafficking of cocaine, nor did he have any prior knowledge of the location of the drugs. The interaction between the youth and the officer was brief and meaningful. The interactions between the officer and the accused were brief and respectful."
9_2014skpc205.txt,"There was contradictory evidence regarding the central issue of consent and therefore the court had to assess credibility. The complainant’s action of fleeing the situation was found to be consistent with both not consenting and with regret, humiliation and embarrassment. The evidence of the accused’s witnesses was found to raise a reasonable doubt about the complainant’s non-consent. The court concluded that the complainant was not as intoxicated as she said; for example, she had a conversation with the accused’s sister. Therefore, the court was also not satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt that the complainant was incapable of consenting due to her level of intoxication. It was unnecessary for the court to consider whether the accused had an honest but mistaken belief in consent. The accused was found not guilty.","The accused is charged with sexual assault of the complainant contrary to s. 271 of the Criminal Code. The charge arises from sexual activity that occurred between the accused and the complainant in December 2012. The complainant has no memory of the sexual activity due to an alcohol induced blackout. The Crown argues that there was no consent. The accused does not deny that he had sex with the complainant. He claims that the activity was consensual or, alternatively, that he has an honest but mistaken belief in consent. HELD: The accused is not guilty. The Court heard contradictory evidence with respect to the central issue of consent, an assessment of credibility, which is to be assessed in light of all the evidence. It is open to the accused to claim that the complainant's words and actions, before and during the incident, raise a reasonable doubt against her assertion that she, in her mind, did not want the sexual touching to take place. If the complainant did not consent, did the accused have an honest and mistaken belief that consent?"

The plane crashed in Nova Scotia and the plaintiff, claiming negligence by the defendants in the manufacture of the parts, commenced an action in Nova Scotia. The defendants applied to declare Nova Scotia forum non conveniens. Dismissing the application, that there is a real and substantial connection to both jurisdictions and the plaintiff's forum choice appeared reasonable and should not be disturbed.","The plaintiff alleged that in 1988 he purchased aircraft parts from the defendants, such parts being parts being PA-11 fuselage. The defendant was in the business of manufacturing and selling such parts in the U.S.A. The aircraft crashed in August 1992, and the plaintiff alleges the crash was due to faulty and substandard materials used by the defendant in the manufacture or construction of the package. The defendants applied to have the Originating Notice and Statement of Claim set aside as this Court has no jurisdiction, or to has the action stayed on the basis of forum conveniens. Forum non conveniens were found in this case and the plaintiffs choice of forum was a reasonable one."

On the drive home, she was injured in a motor vehicle accident when she fainted and her car crossed the centre line of the highway and struck another vehicle. She sued three members of the clinic staff, including the doctor who performed the abortion, alleging negligence in letting her drive after the abortion. Awarding the plaintiff $724,000 for past and future loss of income, future loss of pension, and general damages, that based on the evidence of the possible complications from surgery such as an abortion, and considering the emotional impact of an abortion on all women, the defendants breached their standard of care as health care professionals in permitting the plaintiff to drive after the abortion.","The plaintiff nurse brought an action against the defendants, alleging that they were negligent in allowing her to drive home after having an abortion despite having specifically been advised not to do so. The female plaintiff sought an order of judgment for $115,000.00. The order provided that the two actions would be heard together because of common issues, but that the assessment of damages for the plaintiff would be held at a later date. The court found that one defendant did not exist and was simply listed as a defendant by mistake. The other defendant was found not to be a party to the action."
e_2007skca122.txt,"This is an appeal from a decision of the trial judge who granted a motion to withdraw the case from the jury in an action for damages in negligence brought by the appellant plaintiff against the respondent defendants. The action arose out of burn suffered by the appellant while participating in demolition derby run by the defendants. The motion was granted on the premise there was no case to go to the jury because the appellant had failed to adduce sufficient evidence of the requisite causal connection between his injury and the alleged acts of negligence, and the standard of care required of the respondents. In consequence, the trial judge dismissed the action with costs to the respondents. The issue on appeal is whether the trial judge applied the test correctly in light of the evidence. HELD: Appeal dismissed. 1) Had the case been permitted to go to the jury on the theory of the appellant, the jury would have been asked to conclude on a balance of probabilities that, but for the actions of the flagman who failed to immediately halt the competition and alert the Fire Department to the condition he had observed, the appellant would have suffered less serious burns than he in fact suffered. Similarly, the jury would have been asked to conclude that, but for the failure of the volunteer fire fighters to take more effective action, the appellant would have suffered less serious burns. The jury could not have arrived at either conclusion, given the evidence of the duration the appellant was on fire, about 30 seconds, and the expert evidence that his injuries would have occurred virtually instantaneously or within 5 to 6 seconds of his having caught on fire while still in his vehicle. In the light of this evidence, and in the absence of further evidence of the standard of care required of each of the respondent, the Court is of the opinion the jury could not rationally have concluded that either of the respondents caused or materially contributed to the extend of the appellant's injury. On the basis of the expert evidence, the damage would have occurred just the same, fault or no fault on the part of the respondents. That being so, the damage could not be seen to have been caused or materially contributed to by the respondents. 2) There is no tenable basis for this Court to interfere with the trial judge's award of costs.","This was an appeal from a decision of the Madam Justice Rothery who granted a motion to withdraw the case from the jury in an action for damages in negligence brought by the appellant against the respondents, Bjorkdale Lions Club and the Village of Bjorksdale. The action arose out of burns suffered by the respondent while participating in a demolition derby run by the Lions Club with the assistance of the fire department. The fire department was standing by in the sense that it had a fire truck parked nearby and had some of its members in attendance. HELD: The appeal was dismissed in its entirety. The respondents shall have their costs taxed in the usual way. The Court found that the trial judge employed the right test in addressing the motion, having addressed it along the lines of whether the plaintiff had adduced sufficient evidence, considered in its best light, to enable the jury, properly instructed and acting judicially, to find the defendants or either them liable in negligence. The jury could not rationally have concluded that either of the respondents caused or contributed to the extent of the appellant's injury. On the basis of the expert evidence, the damage would have occurred just the same as in the respondents' case. The damage could not be seen to have been caused or materially contributed to by the respondents."
b_2011skqb219.txt,"The applicant is a residential unit owner in the condominium corporation. He sought a declaration pursuant to Queen's Bench Rule 664 interpreting the bylaws of the condominium corporation with respect to the voting rights of the commercial unit owners. The condominium has 32 units with the three largest units being commercial units. The remaining 29 units are residential. The parties agreed that the commercial owners were entitled to nominate and vote for three positions on the Board of Directors. A dispute arose as to whether the commercial owners were entitled to vote on the election of the positions on the Board designated for representatives of the residential unit holders. The Board of Directors passed a resolution interpreting the bylaw such that the commercial owners were entitled to nominate up to three people for election to the Board, all owners were entitled to vote on all nominees, all the owners agreed to cast their votes so as to elect the commercial owners nominees and where that does not happen the commercial owners are entitled to vote as a class to elect their nominees and there is no restriction in the bylaw limiting the right of the commercial owners to vote on positions to the Board. HELD The appropriate standard of review is that of reasonableness and deference must be given to the Board of Directors with regard to its interpretation of the bylaw. There is no specific provision in the bylaws that would restrict the voting rights of the commercial owners. Prohibiting any owner from voting altogether would be contrary to s. 41 of The Condominium Property Act because the Act provides that all owners are to vote on all questions proposed at any meeting. The proper interpretation of the bylaws has nothing to do with the principles of contract interpretation. The application was dismissed. The interpretation of the bylaw by the Board of Directors was reasonable and that Court was not prepared to interfere with it.","HELD: The application was granted. The court ordered a declaration interpreting the bylaws of the Condominium Corporation with regard to the election of the members of the Board with a view to determining the voting rights of the commercial owners. It found that principles of contract interpretation had no place within the scope of the within application, being the interpretation of a condominium bylaw. Principles were not appropriate in this application. A sample of the applicant's affidavit material was provided to the parties. It was clear from the interpretation that the applicant was asking that the Court disregard portions of his affidavit that the bylaw was not intended to be interpreted as being contrary to the commercial owner's voting rights. As there were only seven positions on the Board, a vote was required. The applicant was also asking the court for a declaration that all of the board members were entitled to vote on all questions proposed at a meeting of unit owners.

d_2013skpc56.txt,"The accused was convicted after trial of trafficking cocaine and breach of probation. The issue was whether the accused could be sentenced to a custodial disposition under s. 39(1)(d) of the Youth Criminal Justice Act. HELD: The youth was sentenced to deferred custody. The amount of cocaine was significant, the accused was the only person involved in the offence, it was a fairly unsophisticated operation, the impact on the small northern community where the offence occurred was huge, it is aggravating that the drug being trafficked was cocaine, the accused has a previous criminal record for trafficking, the place where the offence was committed is a friendship centre and a popular gathering spot for youth in the area and the offence was committed for financial gain. The Court held that the most aggravating factor on sentence was that the accused was less than one month into a probation order imposed for trafficking cocaine and was to stay out of the province. The Court held that it was impossible to conclude that the probation order the accused had previously been placed on had in any way achieved its goal of rehabilitation and reintegration of the offender.","The accused was convicted of possession for the purposes of trafficking cocaine (Cocaine for the Purpose of Trafficking) and contrary to s. 5(2) of the Controlled Drugs and Substances Act. The accused had been bound by a youth probation order for failing to attend a youth court function for the purpose of trafficking. One of the terms of the probation order was that he was to stay out of the Province unless he had permission of the Court to do so. The Crown conceded that with this not being a violent offence and with his limited criminal record the accused was not subject to custody under either s. 39(1)(d) or (c). The Ontario Court of Appeal provided some guiding principles on the use of s.(5)(1) of The Code in its R. v. E.W. decision. HELD: The accused was placed on a 6 month deferred custody and supervision order on all three counts on which he was convicted. He was sentenced to 6 months deferred custody followed by 12 months probation. 1)The Court was convinced beyond a reasonable doubt that the prime motivation behind the drug trafficking was financial gain. There was no evidence that this activity of the accused, who was cruising around Kikinaahk Friendship Centre which is the main gathering place for older children and adolescents in La Ronge, ought never be considered routine or usual. The Court found that the very existence of cocaine and heroin in the trafficking operation was itself an aggravating factor in and of itself. 2)The accused had served approximately thirty days in remand and did not appear to benefit by any more time in actual custody. The Youth Court Worker was qualified as an expert to testify on the characteristics of drug operation and street values and would have been in a better position to advise the accused on the appropriate use of the tools available to him. 3)There was little to no evidence he was motivated by financial gain or anything less than custody would satisfy the principles of sentencing set out in s. 38 of the Code."
5_1998canlii13934.txt,"Landlord and Tenant - Writ of Possession_____ The landlord applied for an order for a writ of possession pursuant to s50 of the Landlord and Tenant Act. The 41 month lease required a monthly rental of $500 for the first five months and thereafter semi-annual payments of $5,000. The tenants had not paid any rent in 1998 nor had they maintained insurance; they installed alternating stalls in the barn in breach of their covenant not to make any alterations or additions to the premises; breached the express and implied covenants to keep the premises in good condition and tenantable repair by their failure to remove and properly dispose of baler twine, to maintain proper weed control or to remove manure buildup in the calf barn. The tenants admitted the rental payment was due in May but claimed the landlord breached the pre-condition wherein Russell's husband promised to repair the damage caused by a 1995 hail storm. The claims for repair was far in excess of those provided for in the lease which were the tenant's responsibility._____ HELD: 1)The landlord was entitled to a writ of possession since the tenants were in breach of the covenant to pay rent for more than two calendar months. 2)A trial of the issue was ordered to determine whether the tenants were in breach of covenants in the lease. The matter should not be decided summarily where there are questions of fact or law. The hail damage may allow the tenants to claim in damages against the landlord but it could not be construed as a debt due for the purposes of s27 of the Landlord and Tenant Act. The remaining alleged breaches could not be determined summarily.  3)Costs of the application were awarded to the landlord in any event of the cause.","The landlord applied for a writ of possession pursuant to s50 of the Landlord and Tenant Act. The applicants had entered a lease with the landlords in 1995 with respect to land which had been damaged by a 1995 hail storm. The previous owners had promised to repair the damageto the premises from a hail storm which occurred in 1995 and the damage had never been repaired. The respondents were in arrears of rent by more than 2 months and in breach of their covenant to obtain and maintain suitable insurance up on the leased premises. The applicant had installed two new stalls in the barn and the applicant was required to give notice of the claim of set off to the landlord. HELD: A trial of the issue was directed to determine whether the respondents were IN breach of the covenant to pay rent and the alleged failure to maintain proper weed control. 1)The payment due May 1998 was not made because, they allege, Russell has breached the lease(clause 5.2) and because there was a pre-condition to the lease wherein the landlord promised to fix the damagraeto the property from a 1995 storm which happened in 1995. 2)The plaintiff was entitled to awrit of possession in possession of a section of land which was entirely covered with wild millet (a weed) but which was in good condition and tenantable repair. 3)The remaining allegations concerning the alleged breaches of the covenants by the landlords could not be determined summarily. The plaintiff had failed to respond to the allegation that one quarter of land had not been seeded and therefore is entirely covered in wild milk. 4)A writ of possess was granted to the plaintiff in accordance with Form 'C' of the Act and it would be necessary to have a trial to determine if or not Russell is entitled to possession for any of those other reasons."
3_2000skqb75.txt,"The applicant sought to vary the 1995 consent judgment by terminating or significantly reducing spousal support of $2,500 per month. The respondent suggested the reduction should be limited to the amount she now received from her old age pension and CPP. Neither wanted a trial of the issue and submissions were primarily confined to the financial information filed. HELD: On-going spousal support was reduced to $1,750 per month from April until March 1, 2001 and $1,250 thereafter.  1)It is clear from Bracklow that each case involving spousal support must be determined on its own facts. The court must give due consideration to all the factors and objectives of a spousal support order set out in s.15.2 of the Divorce Act rather than focusing on one factor alone, such as income levels or self sufficiency.  2)There had been a material change in circumstances as the applicant, now 62, had lost his employment and suffered a debilitating leg injury while the respondent, now 67, was receiving an old age pension. 3)The 1995 agreement did not provide spousal support was either time limited or that it was to be varied if there was a substantial change in their future financial positions. However, it was unlikely the parties intended spousal support to continue indefinitely at $2,500 per month even after the applicant retired. The respondent was disadvantaged by the traditional marriage to a greater degree than the applicant as she devoted her full time to working in the home. She received her full share of their joint efforts in the form of an equal division of the matrimonial property. The economic benefits and disadvantages that flow from the marriage and its dissolution must be taken into account (Moge). There was no merit in the wait-and-see suggestion of the respondent. 4)No costs.","The applicant applied to vary a February 1, 1995 consent judgment by terminating or significantly reducing his obligation to pay further spousal support. The amount he was required to pay under the 1995 judgment was $2,500 per month. The application was triggered by the applicant's loss of employment and a debilitating leg injury. The parties had three children, all now adults living independently of their parents. The respondent, now retired, supported the applicant from the date of separation until 1993 when the level of support was set by a divorce judgment, at which time the support was reduced to $1,500. The applicant met the threshold for a variation application by demonstrating that there had been a material change in circumstances. Although he had no employment income, the applicant was able to pursue and develop his career as an engineer because of the joint investment income available to his second wife and himself with an estimate of what portion is attributable to her. The combined current amount of his retirement income is just over $775 per month, which is well below the respondent's estimate. HELD: 1)It was evident that the applicant had retired and had no intention to become re-employed. It was essential that he know now what his future obligations were.  2)The application was dismissed with costs.  3)Each party to marriage is disadvantaged by its breakdown. In this case, being a traditional marriage, the respondent has been disadvantaged to a greater degree than the applicant. She devoted her full time to raising their three children and raising them to be the most productive financially. She was also economically capable of earning a significant level of income. She could also supplement her own income by selling her residence and purchasing some form of annuity. Neither counsel filed any cases in support of their respective positions and confined their submissions primarily to the financial information filed. 4)The applicant was awarded costs."
c_2002skqb47.txt,"FIAT. The defendant sought to have costs reduced because the plaintiff was unsuccessful in part of her claim for damages for the injury to her ankle and resulting pain disorder when she fell after stepping on a metal plate bolted to the floor at the mall entrance of the defendant's store. The plaintiff was awarded $77,406.15 plus special damages and pre-judgment interest for a total of $120,540.43. The offer to settle for $75,000 plus taxable costs had been refused. The defendant argued the plaintiff's bill of costs should be taxed at 50% as she only received about 13 and 1/3% of the amount claimed; the costs were disproportionate to the judgment and the offer to settle, made in good faith, was never formally responded to. The plaintiff argued extensive witness costs were incurred because the defendant declined to agree to the filing of medical reports. At issue was whether the success of each affects the amount of costs to be awarded to either; the amount to be awarded for expert witnesses; and level at which a second counsel fee should be taxed or allowed. HELD: 1)Taxable costs should not be based on either hardship or the degree of success. Solely because recovery falls short of the amount claimed is not a reason to deprive a successful party of costs. Although costs are in the discretion of the Court, they usually go to the successful party. 2)It was appropriate in this case to reduce by 50% the plaintiff's costs taxable under column 4 since over half of the plaintiff's witnesses who were called to testify and most of the trial time was dedicated to the pain disorder claim, which proved only minor non-pecuniary damages. 3)A great deal of the plaintiff's expert medical evidence was of marginal value. Great care must be taken by a party who obtains leave to call more than five expert witnesses to ensure their testimony will assist the case. Expenses of each was examined separately. In some cases, medical report charges or consultation and preparation time were not recoverable from the defendant as not being of value or too exorbitant. 4)A second counsel fee was allowed at 50% of first counsel fee. A second counsel fee is in the discretion of the Court and is limited to two-thirds of the fee paid for first counsel. The amount at risk and complexity of the pain disorder claim justified second counsel in this case. Although one lawyer could have handled the trial without difficulty as there was considerable down time, that could not be known in advance. 5)Costs of the four pre-trial conferences, unspecified number of management pre-trial conferences, pre-trial brief, medical reports for doctors who were not called as witnesses are matters for consideration by the taxing officer rather than the Court. It was recommended that no fee should be considered when there is simply an adjournment because the pre-trial conference is premature; there is no tariff item for a pre-trial brief and in most cases is included in the attendance charge; a charge of $50 for each management pre-trial conference be allowed to a total limit of $500; costs of transcripts be recovered from the defendant. Costs payable by the plaintiff on an interlocutory application may be deducted from the plaintiff's Bill of Costs.",FIAT. An application to determine the issue of costs. The defendant sought to have the costs reduced because the plaintiff was unsuccessful in part of her claim. HELD: 1) The plaintiff's second counsel was experienced and the plaintiff requested a fee of two-thirds that of the defendant's first counsel. The plaintiff was not opposed to having her second counsel testify. 2) Expert medical evidence was of significant value to the Court in this case. The court found that more was obtained than set out in the offer to settle; extensive witness costs were incurred because the defendant declined to file medical reports and the costs were proportionate to the claim advanced. 3) The defendant would not permit the plaintiff to file a medical practitioners' report without calling the doctors for cross-examination purposes. 4) Costs payable by the defendant to the plaintiff on interlocutory applications may be deducted from the plaintiff's Bill of Costs.
4_2004skqb516.txt,"The accused applies by notice of motion to quash the search warrants that were issued authorizing the search of his residence and to exclude any evidence obtained as a result of the search. The application alleges a violation of the accused's s. 8 Charter rights. HELD: Although the search warrants relied upon in this case are invalid and the resultant search of the accused's premises was a violation of his s.8 Charter rights, nevertheless, the facts and all the circumstances do not satisfy the Court that the admission of the evidence would bring the administration of justice into disrepute. The application to exclude the evidence is dismissed.  1) The Crown stipulated the s. 487 Criminal Code warrant is invalid. That leaves the validity of s. 11 of Controlled Drugs and Substances Act (CDSA). 2) The CDSA warrant is invalid in that it does not sufficiently or adequately state the offences in respect of which the warrant was issued. The search was therefore warrantless. 3) The evidence seized was non-conscriptive and so its admission would not render the trial unfair. 4) There was no bad faith, malice or intentional omission involved in the preparation of the warrants. The officer was negligent in failing to review the applicable sections and forms of the Code and the CDSA. The absence of any malevolent intention, while it does not bear on the validity of the warrants, has some bearing in the s. 24(2) Charter analysis. 5) The existence of reasonable and probable grounds to obtain the search warrants to search the accused's residential premises, together with the seizure of $750,000 in cash from the accused's residence as a result of the search, fulfill a number of the circumstances under s. 24(2) of the Charter.","Cst. Olberg applied for and obtained two Saskatchewan search warrants pursuant to s. 487 of the Criminal Code and s. 11 of the Controlled Drugs and Substances Act. The search of the accused's residence, the seizure of the money (and other items) and Smith's arrest were the culmination of an investigation that had begun many months earlier. These investigations concerned alleged illegal cross-border drug trafficking between the United States and Canada including evidence allegedly implicating the accused, Smith. The investigations were outlined in and the subject matter of two Informations to Obtain the Code and CDSA Warrants. The Crown argued that if both warrants were found to be invalid, then the resultant warrantless search of Smith's residence and surrounding premises was warrantless. The items seized during the search ought to be excluded as evidence at his upcoming trial by virtue of s. 24(2) of the Charter. HELD: 1) The evidence satisfied the court that there was no bad faith, malice or intentional omission involved in the preparation of the warrants. The warrant was valid. The only warrant that was invalid was the CDSA s. 465(1)(c) warrant. 2) The Court accepted the Crown's submission that the two search warrants as issued were invalid. However, it was unable to conclude that either warrant could not be sustained. The Court found that both the warrants had obvious and noticeable omissions and/or errors. Nor did they read properly from the standpoint of simple English. 3) There was no evidence obtained as a result of the search by the Crown of any wrong doing. 4) The affidavit evidence was excused by s. 583 of the Code. 5) An overall reading of the warrant and in particular pages and (the latter outlining, as it was intended to do, the proposed offences in respect of which the warrant authorization pertains) was inadequate and unsatisfactory to meet the minimum offence description requirements contemplated by Form S. 24 of the code as those requirements have been further interpreted and identified to apply in the Dombrowski and Alder cases, [2007] 1 S.C.R. 631. The absence of any malevolent intention, while it does not in these circumstances bear directly upon the validity of the Warrants, is nevertheless commented upon because of the bearing that it may have upon any s.24(1) Charter analysis that may need to be undertaken.  5) The issues to be decided as result of a voir dire are whether the warrants are valid or whether they are invalid"
5_2011nspc8.txt,"The defendant entered into a plea agreement to a charge of sexually assaulting his young son but, shortly before the sentencing hearing, he applied to withdraw his guilty plea on the basis that he had not been fully informed of the nature of the allegations, partly due to a communication issue (English was not his first language) and partly because he had not viewed the video of his son's statement to the police prior to the plea. He did not accept the Crown's version of the incident and had not fully understood the effect and consequences of his plea, especially its effect on his ability to have contact with his son. The defendant argued that he thought the charge was based upon an incident where he had touched his son's penis for the purpose of showing him how to clean it as opposed to the Crown's assertion that he had masturbated his son and himself while viewing pornography. Application to withdraw guilty plea dismissed; the defendant's evidence regarding his knowledge of the facts alleged by the Crown in relation to the sexual assault was inconsistent and the court was not convinced that either his failure to see the video of his son's statement or a language/communication issue had prevented him from having a full understanding of the specific allegation of the sexual assault. The defendant's motivation for pleading guilty did not alter his knowledge and understanding of the nature of the allegation nor his understanding that he was, by his plea, admitting to that allegation.","This is an application by the accused to set aside his guilty plea to count #1, the sexual assault of his son. The Court found that the test in Nevin, supra, was not met and the application was dismissed. The Defense position is that the accused was not fully informed of the nature of the allegation, which was part of his motivation for pleading guilty, nor his understanding that he, by his plea, was admitting to that allegation. The accused's evidence regarding his awareness of the consequences of his plea to sexual assault on his son on decision of the Supreme Court Family Division regarding access to the child was not credible. The standard of proof is the civil burden. The test in R. v. R.T. (1992) cited Nevin as the correct statement of the test to be applied on this application. HELD: The Court dismissed the application. 1)The Court was not persuaded that the defence offered an innocent explanation of the plea to the behaviour of the accused in this case. 2)The accused had not seen the videotaped interview or the joint submission to be made by the Crown and myself. 3)There was no interpreter present during the sentencing. 4)The evidence was inconclusive as to the accused's knowledge of the gravity of the allegations and their effect on his ability to have contact with his son as he testified. 5)There is no evidence the accused told the accused that he wished to plead guilty, that he only wanted to show his son how to clean his penis as his father had shown him and his remorse was for the trouble brought to his family. The fact that he failed to offer an explanation for the alleged sexual assault did not change the Court's view of his knowledge and understanding of his obligation to protect his son and his right to be free of it."
b_1998canlii12364.txt,"The primary issue was whether the youth court has jurisdiction in proceedings which are commenced in youth court where it was not possible to determine whether at the time the alleged offences were committed the accused was a young person or an adult. The secondary issue was whether a writ of mandamus should issue. The accused was charged with two indictable offences, sexual assault and incest, as well as acts of gross indecency. The Crown stayed an identical information previously laid against the accused alleging the same offences occurred when he was an adult. The accused became an adult in October 1985 and was charged with certain offences which occurred between 1985 and 1989. The summary conviction appeal court judge found the provincial court judge erred in declining jurisdiction and that because of the uncertainty when the alleged offences occurred, the accused should be tried under the least onerous regime, youth court. The appeal judge then ordered a writ of mandamus directing the youth court judge to render a decision. It was common ground that a youth court judge does not have jurisdiction with respect to offences committed while he was an adult. HELD: The decision of the summary conviction appeal court was set aside and the matter remitted to youth court. Either party may apply for an order under s16 to decide the proper forum to hear the charges.  1)Section 16 is the ideal vehicle for the youth court to make a proper determination of the proper jurisdiction to hear the charges. If the Crown after a complete investigation is unable to particularize the time when the offence(s) occurred and alleges that it (they) occurred over a period of time which included when the accused was a young offender and an adult, the preferable approach is to have the Crown commence the proceedings in youth court because some of the offences occurred while he was a youth. The Crown should then apply to a youth court judge for a transfer hearing under s16 to determine the proper forum to hear the charges.  2)There are two ways to determine which of the two courts should assume jurisdiction: view the facts in a manner most favorable to the accused and deem the offence was committed when the accused was a young person; or order a transfer hearing under s16(1) of the Young Offenders Act to determine whether the offences should be heard in youth court or ordinary court. 3)The transfer hearing must proceed in an impartial fashion in accordance with the principles of natural justice and s7 of the Charter. 4)Section 16(2) provides the factors to be taken into account in determining the competing interests of the youth and the public. 5)The position taken in the Ontario Court of Appeal in R.v. A(EA) does not lend itself to universal application. R. v. A(EA) is distinguishable and should be confined to its particular facts.","HELD: The appeal was allowed. The conviction was set aside and the matter remitted to youth court to be heard according to law. The court found that a youth court judge should have assumed jurisdiction in proceedings which were commenced in youth court where it is alleged that the offences occurred when the accused was either a young person or an adult. The Crown did not present any evidence of when the alleged offences occurred. The accused was found not guilty on all of the charges.  1) The evidence did not support a conviction on all the other charges. The youth judge was not prepared to assume jurisdiction on counts two and three. He was not able to determine the time of the offences when they occurred. 2) The principles set out in R. v. A. (E.A.) are applicable. The trial judge must inquire of the parties whether they wish to make a transfer application before accepting a guilty plea.  3) The jurisdiction of the youth court is determined by s. 5(1) of the Act. It does not depend on averments in the information or on proof of age. The Court considered the effects of the transition provisions in the Act and found that the accused could not be found guilty in any of the circumstances. 4) The Court found that if the Crown, after a complete investigation, was unable to particularize the time when the offence or offences occurred and as a result alleges that the same offences occurred over a period of time, which includes when he was a young offender and an adult, the accused should be tried under the least onerous regime, the Youth Court."
d_2010skqb173.txt,"The petitioner and respondent are the parents of twins. The petitioner father sought variation of a consent order. The consent order provided that the parties would have joint custody of the children with the primary residence with the respondent. The order also provided that the respondent would have the final decision with respect to health and education matters, after consultation with the petitioner. The situation had evolved to the point that the petitioner had relocated to the same city as the respondent and children. For the past two and a half year, the petitioner had access to the children 50% of the time. The petitioner acknowledged that under the current arrangement, the respondent consulted him before making decisions regarding the welfare of the children. The consent order dealt with child support payable, provided that tax returns be exchanged annually and set out how child support should be calculated on an ongoing basis. The petitioner sought to have the child support arrangement varied so that his support obligation would not increase or decrease in the years to come. The petitioner cited increased personal costs to exercise access to the children. HELD: The petitioner had not established a material change in circumstances sufficient to justify a change to the parenting arrangement. The original consent order provides that the respondent must consult with the petitioner on issues of health and education and the current arrangement has worked well for the children. The petitioner also failed to establish a material change in circumstances sufficient to alter the agreed child support arrangement. The issue of increased costs for the petitioner to exercise access to the children was dealt with in the original consent order. The only change in circumstances is that the petitioner's income has increased. The petitioner's application to vary the parenting arrangement and child support order was dismissed.

She then relocated to Regina to be with her family where the children were born. The respondent as single parent was able to access family supports after the twins were born in Regina. HELD: The application is dismissed. 1) There has not been a material change of circumstance with regard to the petitioner's increased costs as a result of the shared parenting arrangement. However, there is some evidence that the petitioner has not worked well with respect to the current terms of the parenting judgment. 2) There is no evidence that this has worked in the best interests of the children. 3) The petitioner seeks to have his child support payment as set out in the February 2007 parenting judgment be varied to provide that his $762 per month payment that he currently makes not be increased or decreased in the years to come. 4) The respondent opposes the application and says there has been no material change in the circumstances of the child. The court cannot retry the case, substituting its discretion for that of the original judge; it must assume the correctness of the decision and consider only the change in circumstances since the order was issued."
7_2001skqb10.txt,"The divorce action was based on separation for more than a year.  In issue were custody and access, child support, spousal maintenance, possession and division of matrimonial property. HELD: 1)Divorce was granted. The parties, married 19 years, had been living separate and apart since January 1998. 2)They agreed to joint custody of both children. The son was to reside primarily with his father. The daughter resided with her mother. Access was essentially reciprocal on alternative weekends. The children were to be together most weekends. School vacations would be shared. 3)The father was to pay monthly child support of $485 based on his gross salary of $61,200 which included a $1500 car allowance. Expenses for music lessons, band and extracurricular school activities did not qualify as a special or extraordinary expense. The father was to contribute his proportionate share (73% to reflect spousal maintenance) of orthodontic expenses not covered by insurance. 4)Spousal maintenance of $900 was to be reviewable after December 31, 2003. The mother's job advancement was impeded as a result of the marriage, specifically by frequent moves to accommodate her husband's job transfers. She had worked out of the home for limited income to facilitate child rearing. 5)The parties agreed the matrimonial home would be sold and proceeds divided equally after payment of expenses of the sale. Costs of any major repairs were to be split equally pending the sale. The petitioner was entitled to occupy the property and was to pay the mortgage, insurance, utilities and other usual costs.  6)It was inferred the value of the chattels was the same as that at the date of the marriage. It would be inequitable to order a distribution of chattel property given as antiques or heirlooms by her parents valued in excess of $6,000. The inheritance from her aunt who died almost a year after the separation was excluded. The motor vehicles were divided in accordance with their value as of October 2000. All other matrimonial property and debts and obligations were valued as of the date of the petition. RRSPs were to be equalized as of October 15, 1999 by rollover. 7)The respondent was to convey one-half of the commuted value of his pension at date of the petition to a locked in RRSP in the name of the petitioner. The balance in excess of the maximum amount transferable under the Pension Benefits Act resulted in an adjustment of $2,042.75. The respondent was to assume any debts.  8)No costs were awarded.","The parties had been living separate and apart since January 23, 1998.

The respondent was receiving income as a child of a deceased World War II veteran and had Canada Pension Plan income as the result of his father's death. The two children were healthy and active.

2006nssc158.txt,"The parties, who were the parents of two children, separated after a seven year marriage. For the five years since the separation, their parenting time with the children had been distributed on a two-week basis. In the divorce proceeding, the mother, who planned to remarry and relocate, sought to become the primary caregiver of the children, with the father to have access only every second weekend. The father sought to vary the parenting time so that both parents would equally share their time with the children. Current parenting arrangement to remain in effect with the parties retaining joint custody of the children; table amount of child support set. The parenting pattern followed for the past five years had been working well for the children and appeared to be serving their needs; the mother's proposal would lessen the children's time with their father and the father's proposal would also create a significant change for the children, removing their current home base.",The court granted the divorce on the grounds of a breakdown of the marriage and the fact that the parties had lived separate and apart for more than a year prior to the commencement of the proceeding. The parties agreed to joint custody of their children and that the father would pay child support of $647 per month for the child care expenses. The mother sought to vary the parenting time so that he and the child would equally share their time with the children. The father proposed that the child live with the mother every second weekend and that this would be in the children's best interest since they would have regular access every other weekend. The daughter sought to have the father make child support payments by paying a table amount in accordance with his income and by making a contribution to the $800 child care cost in the amount of $800. HELD: The current parenting arrangements were in effect with the exception of one change regarding Remembrance Day. The parents agreed to share child care time with their children for a period of five years.  1)The father had been paying $800 per month since their separation to provide child care of the children and for the past five years the child had been following the same pattern in their interaction with their parents. This was reasonable and necessary and in their best interest. 2)The mother was entitled to leave her position as the primary care giver and child caretaker for the children for an extended period of time. She was also entitled to make a contribution towards child maintenance on a bi-monthly basis.  3)The court found that the expense to the mother was actually less than $800 as it did not put him in a position where he could be a parent who is sharing custody pursuant to s.16 of the Child Support Orders. Spousal support was ordered.
2_2009nssc364.txt,"The parties entered into an agreement and registered it with the court in 2008. It provided for a combined spousal/child support payment of $2,000/month, which the husband was able to claim on his taxes because of the shared custody arrangement they were in at the time. At the time of their divorce in 2009, the wife wanted to incorporate the agreement into the corollary relief judgment. The husband argued a dramatic drop in his income forced him to abandon the parties' shared parenting regime, which resulted in significant tax consequences and justified a change to the agreement's support provisions to include only the table amount of child support. He argued the change in circumstances was so extensive as to undermine the integrity of the agreement. The evidence showed the wife needed $2,000/month in order to keep the bank from foreclosing on the home she occupied with the children, and to allow her to finish retraining so she could enter the workforce. The husband (a self-employed financial planner) argued the recent world economic crisis had adversely affected his business to an extent unanticipated when the agreement was executed (October 2008). The evidence showed that his focus was to solicit new business rather than cut expenses to make his business more viable. He chose to spend less time with the children to do this, which impacted the children and wife. The agreement is binding; the support provisions are to be incorporated into the corollary relief judgement. This concerns an agreement registered under the Maintenance and Custody Act. It is not an application to vary under the Divorce Act, but rather an application to overturn an agreement (although the distinction doesn't impact the outcome). The terms of the agreement must be given great deference. Will enforcing it reflect the parties' original intent and be in substantial compliance with the Act? The court looked at the second branch of the test in Miglin: whether something has happened that was outside the parties' contemplation when the agreement was made. Care must be taken to distinguish between circumstances giving rise to the agreement and those making compliance difficult. Taking judicial notice, the court observed the world economic crisis was the subject of much debate before the agreement was made, even if it was more extreme than anticipated. Here, the agreement: used strong, unambiguous language; was arrived at after extensive negotiations by sophisticated parties and with the assistance of counsel; and was very important to each party. To overturn it would not be in the children's best interests: they would lose their home and their mother would be unable to finish her retraining, adversely impacting her ability to provide for them. The change in the husband's circumstances are less likely to impact the integrity of the agreement than would his proposal to disregard it. The husband cannot unilaterally alter the agreement simply by deciding to change the parenting arrangements. His decision to work additional hours and spend less time with his children was not reasonable or fair and in effect transferred the financial and parenting burden to the wife (who was also managing significant financial and professional challenges).","The parties married in 1995 and separated in 2006. They have four children, all of whom are now in a shared parenting arrangement. In 2008, the parties entered a separation agreement that provided for shared parenting. Since that time, the children have been primarily resident with the respondent mother. The respondent now seeks to have the spousal and child support obligations reflected in a paragraph of the 2008 separation agreement changed in as much as he seeks a corollary relief judgment that would not contain this obligation. The principal basis for the respondent's argument is that (1) a significant reduction in his income, and (2) a loss of income tax deductibility for his payment under clause 9 of the separation agreement because he is no longer in a Shared Parenting arrangement.  Corollary Relief Order granted in respect of this application pursuant to s. 15.2(1) of the Divorce Act, and s. 9(b) of that Act, which provides for a shared Parenting Agreement, and an order for child support based on the tables reflecting an income of approximately $30,000 per year. The parties' separation agreement was registered with the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia in June 2009. The petitioner filed an Answer to the Petition for Divorce. It was filed September 15, 2009 and included in its supplementary material a notice of reassessment. It provided for a detailed discussion of the various aspects of the agreement, and gave an overview of the issues.  It was pertinent to note that the respondent had filed his income tax returns from 2006; 2007; and 2008. In addition, the respondent filed a separate income tax return, which was a two-page document summarizing the business income of the petitioner for the years 2005, 2006 and 2007. In it, he listed various expenses that he incurred in order to pay the respondent, who had recently become economically self-sufficient, to complete her post-secondary education, and to make all reasonable efforts to achieve that goal. He also listed some of the expenses that would be charged by the respondent if the respondent were to discontinue or resume payment of spousals in the amount of $2,000 for the duration of the probationary period. HELD: Application dismissed.  1) The Court's jurisdiction is limited by s. 17(1)(a) to determine what amount of support, if any, should be ordered based solely on the factors set out in the Act. 2) There is no evidence that the corollaries relief order will result from this hearing. 3"

On July 31, 2003, the accused first appeared in court. The information was adjourned until October 6, 2003 due to lack of Legal Aid resources. On November 3, 2003, not guilty plea was entered and trial was set for May 6, 2004. On May 6, 2004, the trial was adjourned on application by the Crown due to the non-attendance of the complainant and new trial date was set for October 7, 2004. HELD: There was no Charter breach and the application is dismissed. 1) The length of delay from the date of release to the date of trial is approximately 15 months. This is not a complicated case and the delay warrants an inquiry. 2) The Court did not accept the accused's submission that he suffered actual prejudice because the undertaking prevented him from accessing his children. There were no efforts by the accused to overcome this. 3) The restrictive condition in the undertakings prohibiting him from drinking alcohol has resulted in him being charged with and pleading guilty to offences of breaching his undertaking. As these offences all occurred within what could be considered a reasonable time for the matter to proceed to trial, there is no actual prejudice to the accused. 3) This is a charge that involves an offence of domestic violence and is so serious that it carries the heightened public interest that exists in offences of violence.","Paddy Lemaigre applies for relief pursuant to the Charter of Rights on the basis of post-charge delay denying him the right to have his trial in a reasonable time. There was no Charter breach. HELD: The application was dismissed. 1)There was no breach of the Charter. 2)The delay was either attributable to the Crown or caused by factors outside the control of the accused. The delay of three months between the first and second trial dates was considered as attributable to both parties, it being necessary because of the non-attendance of the complainant who was under subpoena to attend, and 3 months was sufficient delay to warrant an inquiry by Crown counsel. 3)The accused did not contribute to the delay. He appeared on all court dates and was diligent about having the charge set for trial.  4)Discretion was taken to consider whether the prejudice to the accused in the delay was such that it outweighs the prejudice that would result if he was not to face trial."
c_1996canlii6728.txt,"Issues included the division of a pension, child and spousal support and whether to transfer or have sold the matrimonial home which had a small equity.

HELD: 1)The respondent was to pay child support for one child. 2)Spousal support was denied. 3)The matrimonial home was to be sold and proceeds were to be divided equally.  4)Three values were suggested for valuation and distribution of the pension plan. The retirement method of calculating the value of the pension yields the fairest value as opposed to the termination method. The practice by the plan administrator on marriage breakdown was to divide the pension on the basis of the commuted value only and excess contributions were not considered for the purpose of the lump sum transfer to a locked in spousal RRSP. The options were to leave the funds in the plan and defer payment until age 65 or have the commuted value transferred to a locked-in RRSP. The respondent was to make the choice between the only two options.

HELD: 1)The husband was to pay child support for Ryan $260 per month for a period of 24 years.  2)The wife had already reached the earliest eligible retirement date but had not retired. The husband's primary asset was his pension plan. The parties were'spenders' not'savers' and the husband was an undischarged bankrupt. 3)The only marital asset of any value is the wife's pension.

c_2013skqb180.txt,"The parties had a shared parenting arrangement since separation where each party parented their four-year-old child for equal times in a two-week cycle, the petitioner parenting in her home in Moose Jaw and the respondent parenting in his parent's home in Regina. The issue before the Court was to determine where the child should primarily reside and attend school. Each party saw the other as a competent and loving parent. The petitioner had another child, a half-brother to the parties' child, who was an infant at the time of the application. The petitioner was a stay-at-home mom on social assistance and the respondent was a student who worked part-time and lived with his parents. The respondent's parents were willing to assist the respondent financially and in the care of the child. The Court ordered custody/access report concluded that the child should primarily reside with the respondent, though the author noted that the decision was almost too close to make. HELD: The Court held that the best interests of the child would be best served by her primarily residing with the respondent and the parties having joint custody of the child. The Court first considered the quality of the child's relationship with each party and their families and concluded there was little difference between the parties but the child had a closer relationship with the respondent's extended family because she resided with them when she was with the respondent. The Court also determined that the child's economic needs could best be met residing with the respondent and his parents. The home environment of the respondent was found to outweigh that of the petitioner's. Further, the Court held that the child would have greater stability and continuity with the respondent, who has a concrete future plan. The petitioner's future plans were wavering and uncertain. The respondent was ordered to bear the responsibility for transporting the child to and from Moose Jaw and Regina. The respondent was also required to accommodate the petitioner and child by supporting Internet communications between them during the week, especially at bedtime. The petitioner was granted parenting time three consecutive weekends and the respondent on the fourth weekend. The second of the petitioner's weekends was extended to include another day as were any weekends with school or statutory holidays. The decision requires the child to miss one day of school every four weeks and the Court therefore left it to the parties to determine whether this can continue once the child begins grade two. The parties were ordered to each parent the child for half of Easter and Christmas breaks and they were to accommodate each other for Mother's and Father's Day each year. Further, the Court ordered that the child spend half of each summer holiday with each parent, suggesting that alternating weeks may be the best for the child, unless otherwise agreed to by the parties. Lastly, if the child has a school break longer than three clear days, the petitioner is to parent at least one-half of those days. The Court also urged the parties to collaborate and discuss the extra-curricular activities best suited for the child taking into account their affordability and disruption to the parenting arrangement.","HELD: The court held that the petitioner’s primary residence was in Moose Jaw and that it was imminent with the decision of where Madison would attend school. The court also held that it would defer to the court to determine where she would attend her public school graduation party and whether she should seek employment elsewhere. The respondent”s parents were divorced in November 2012. During his youth, the respondent moved about Saskatchewan with his parents, brothers and sister. They resided there for several years. They were married in 2009 and had two children, ages 11 and 12. The petitioner had one child, who was now four years old. The child was normal and resilient in coping with the parent” s separation and conflict. Although the respondent had some difficulties sustaining stable adult relationships, the court found that the child was able to come out of them well-adjusted and would be better off without the assistance of the mother. The mother was competent and loving. The father of the child who had been separated from the petitioner was found to be a very good father to the child. Although he was a good father, the Court noted that the father had not shown the child that she was capable of nurturing a relationship with the child and that she had not been exposed to domestic disharmony firsthand."

Other than the fact of a chain breakage on two separate occasions, there was no evidence produced by the plaintiff, either in his affidavit or during his testimony, addressing the cause of breakage.  1) The plaintiff was not required to provide written notice to the dealer that the implement does not work well, within specified period of time. 2) The dealer or distributor are expressly entitled to an opportunity to repair or correct the deficiencies, upon receipt of notice in writing. The defendants were deprived of the opportunity to inspect and repair by the unreasonable actions of the plaintiff in his failure to allow return of the Spreaders. 3) There was no written notice given to the purchaser prior to the purchase date. If the purchaser does not have written notice, the purchaser must reject the implement. Further, if the purchaser has not taken any steps to make this decision within the next seven days, the defendant will be bound by the same claim as the plaintiff."
5_2012skqb544.txt,"The accused was charged with second degree murder and two counts of aggravated assault. The accused made an O'Connor application for third party records relating to the two surviving Crown witnesses. In particular, the accused sought disclosure of police reports, videotaped evidence, witness statements, warned statements regarding the multiple arrests and charges incurred by the victims and disclosure of their criminal records. In 2012 SKQB 543, the Court ordered production of the records. This decision deals with whether the documents should be produced to the accused. HELD: The documents were disclosed to the accused. The judge vetted the documents to black out words, phrases or numbers that have no probative value or where the privacy interest of the witness would have been unjustifiably affected.","HELD: The Court granted the application. It found the issue of disclosure only and the manner in which the documents and the information contained can be used in examination or cross-examination of the witnesses at trial was not determined. The Court also directed the Crown to provide updated criminal records for each of the accused. Counsel were to receive copies of the same documents as are being released to counsel for the accused and requested that they be given to them. The Crown also sought the services of the RCMP in respect of two Crown witnesses and in particular offences for which these two individuals had previously been convicted (2012 SKQB 543 (CanLII)). The Court found that in most cases, a useful starting point for courts in balancing the competing interests at the second stage of an O’Connor application will be to assess the true relevancy of the targeted record in the case against the defendant. Once court has ascertained upon inspection that third party records are indeed relevant to the accused’s case in the sense that they pertain to an issue in the trial, the first stage balancing exercise is easily performed. In this case, a finding of true relevance puts the third parties in the same category for disclosure purposes as the fruits of the investigation against the accused in the hands of the prosecuting Crown under Stinchcombe. The accused”s interest in obtaining disclosure for the purpose of making a full answer and defence will, as general rule outweigh any residual privacy interest held by third party in the material. This is particularly so with respect of criminal investigation files concerning third party accused. Judicial documents were to be produced for the trial."
d_2011skqb62.txt,"The Crown appealed the acquittal of the accused on a charge under s. 90 of the Criminal Code for carrying a concealed weapon. The accused was spotted at a recycling facility with a sword stuffed in the back of his pants. At trial, defence called evidence suggesting that a sword of that type could be purchased at a novelty store and had a blunt edge. The accused testified that he bought the sword with the intention of hanging it on the wall or putting it on his television. The trial judge found that the Crown had not established that the sword was a weapon or that the accused intended to use it as a weapon. The Crown appealed on the basis that the trial judge misapprehended evidence, ignored other evidence and improperly admitted opinion evidence. HELD: The evidence from the defence 'expert' indicated that he had particular experience that allowed him to recognize the sword and he was able to be of assistance to the Court because of his experience. No attempt was made by the Crown to contradict the evidence that the sword could be purchased at a novelty store and had a blunt edge. The Crown bore the burden of establishing that the sword was a weapon within s. 2 of the Criminal Code and the only evidence before the Court was that the accused probably bought it as a decorative item and that it likely came from a novelty store. On that basis, it was open to the trial judge to conclude that she had a reasonable doubt that the sword was designed to be used as a weapon. The trial judge properly considered the evidence in the context of the issues to be addressed. The Court held that a sword is not prima facie a weapon. The Crown appeal was dismissed.","The Crown appealed the acquittal of the accused on a charge of carrying a concealed weapon contrary to s. 90 of the Criminal Code. The Crown appeals on the grounds that the learned trial judge misapprehended the evidence, ignored other evidence and improperly admitted opinion evidence. HELD: The Crown's appeal is dismissed. 1) The trial judge was aware that it was readily available in novelty stores. As he had no bag or back pack in which to carry it, he tucked it into his shorts. He did not testify as to his eye witness perceptions, but about the sword and where it could be purchased. 2) The Crown argues that the sword should have been found by the trial judge to be a prima facie weapon, in the same manner that a firearm, or brass knuckles or other inherently dangerous items are considered weapons. On this basis, sword would be distinguished from knife, which is not necessarily weapon. There is nothing to show that the knife was designed to be used as a weapon: when it is closed, it is as innocuous as any other jackknife; in order to open it, two hands must be used; the locking device renders the knife safer when it's used for peaceful purposes. 3) On the issue of whether the sword was a weapon within the meaning of s. 2 of the Code, one must first have regard to R. v. Graat, 1982 CanLII 33 (1982) S.C.R. 819 in accepting the accused's evidence. In examining the accused’s evidence, the judge found that the accused probably bought it as a decorative item and (b) that it likely came from a novelty store."
b_2006skqb183.txt,"The plaintiffs seek damages arising from the alleged nuisance and negligence caused the defendants in the operation of the golf course. The plaintiffs also seek an injunction to prohibit the defendants from continuing to operate the golf course in a manner that causes errant golf balls to enter the plaintiffs' property. HELD: 1) The court looked at other jurisdictions for guidance as to what number of errant balls might constitute a nuisance. It would appear that anything from 200 golf balls and up over the span of a year is definitely an unreasonable interference with the use and enjoyment of one's own property. Over a span of 9 years, the plaintiffs have had approximately 1,000 golf balls per year enter their property. In this case, the number of golf balls being hit onto the adjacent properties from the defendant's golf course is far greater than the number cited in many of the cases put forward. There is no doubt then that the present operation of the ninth hole is a nuisance and continues to be a nuisance.  2) The wording of the Optionee's Indemnity clause is of little value to the defendants given the evidence of the parties. The evidence confirms that when the residential area was developed and the contract signed, no one, including the operator, anticipated the extent of the existing problem. Accordingly, the plaintiffs could not have agreed to save the defendant harmless from a problem of this magnitude. 3) The plaintiffs will be compensated for the extensive physical damaged to the plaintiffs' properties, but also for the loss of the use and enjoyment of their yards for 7 months of the year. 4) The plaintiffs are entitled to injunctive relief to put an end to the nuisance that has continued for the past 9 years. The defendants are enjoined from allowing golfers from hitting golf balls on the ninth hole so that they land anywhere near the plaintiffs' property.","The plaintiffs sued the defendants pursuant to Part Forty of the Queen's Bench Rules for damages arising to them from alleged nuisance and negligence caused by the defendants, Great Plains Leaseholds Ltd. and the Town of White City with respect to their operation of the Emerald Park Golf and Country Club Ltd. The plaintiffs' home was adjacent to one another and abut the ninth hole of the golf course. The defendants' golf course was designed and built in the late 1980s without any residential development adjacent to it; however, in 1997, the defendant entered an agreement with Parkview Homes to open up the land beside the Golf Course for residential development. The defendant, which operated the course for more than 10 years without approving a golf course design, brought an application for injunctive relief to put an end to the nuisance which had continued for the past nine years. HELD: The Court ordered the defendants to pay the plaintiffs $18,000 for the loss of use and enjoyment of their property over the next nine years and ordered a specific course of action that the defendants should take to remedy the problem.  1) The defendants refused to accept either of the recommendations in the report. The Court was not prepared to order the specific route of action as the matter had not yet been resolved. 2) The plaintiffs were awarded judgment for $6,000. 3) The defendant were ordered to pay $8,000 in damages to the plaintiffs for the damage caused from the golf balls which were hit from the adjacent golf course in the past 9 years.  4) The plaintiff's claim for damages was dismissed. 5) The Court refused to order an injunction to prevent the defendants from operating the 9 hole golf course until the situation was remedied in accordance with the recommendations therein. 6) The court was unable to find a specific route to take because of the expert's report."
2000skca99.txt,"See also 150 SaskR 185.In 1998 the Court of Appeal dismissed the applicant's sentence appeal and appeal of his 1997 convictions which consisted primarily of sexual offences involving family members and others. The sentence of imprisonment was increased from 5 to 10 years. The applicant, on advice of two counsel, did not initially seek leave to appeal to the Supreme Court of Canada. He changed his mind 2 years later and sought an extension of time to apply for leave and for leave to appeal. The applicant brought an application for release from custody pending the SCC's decision. HELD: The application was dismissed without prejudice to reapply should leave to appeal be granted. 1)The application was premature. The application pending before the SCC was likely to be determined within 3 to 4 months. The Court of Appeal was not satisfied the appeal as a whole was not frivolous having regard for the requirements of s.679(3)(a) and (c). Some grounds for appeal would clearly fail such as the ground the Court of Appeal erred in failing to give reasons for its judgment. The new grounds of appeal were difficult to assess on the basis of the incomplete material before the court. 2)His continued detention was necessary in the public interest having regard for the whole of the circumstances. His release would undermine public confidence in the administration of justice.","The applicant was convicted in July 1997 of several offences, consisting in the main of sexual offences involving members of his family and others close to him. He appealed against his convictions, and the Crown appealed against their sentence. On September 16, 1998 this Court dismissed his appeal against his conviction and allowed the Crown's appeal, increasing the sentence from five to ten years. Throughout, the applicant was represented by senior counsel Mr. S. Halyk Q.C. The applicant decided not to seek leave to appeal to the Supreme Court on any of the weaker grounds and instead applied to the Court of Appeal for an extension of time to apply on one or more of the grounds raised in the proceedings. In the meantime the applicant wanted to be released from custody. HELD: The application for release was dismissed. 1)The prospective appeal as a whole was not frivolous and the applicant's continued detention for the time being was not necessary in the public interest. 2)The present release of the applicant would be inimical to the general public interest, given the history of the past proceedings, the current state of the present proceedings and the fact that the applicant had decided to leave leave in 1998 on the advice of Mr.Halyk and then on the further advice of Dean MacKinnon. Some two years later he changed his mind and applied again for leave. In September 1998 this court dismissed his conviction against conviction, and in effect increased the sentence to five to 10 years. 3)The application for Release was premature. The grounds relied upon on some of the comparatively stronger grounds were difficult to assess in their entirety and were not sufficient to satisfy the requirements of clause (a) of the section 679(3)(a) which was s.6(c). 4)As a purely practical matter the applicant decided to withdraw from custody on his own accord. He then appealed the convictions, appealed against them, and then appealed against the sentence. 5)The applicant sought leave from custody to appeal on one of the more stronger grounds but his decision not to do so was based on mistaken belief that the prospective appeal had sufficient merit to satisfy clause (c)of the section. 6)The less say the better about the merit of the many grounds of appeal upon which the proceedings rest. Some are clearly destined for failure, as here are the two or three grounds upon which counsel for the applicant relied most heavily, including the issue concerning corroboration-but, even then, they do not cut to all of the convictions but only some, nor to the"

The respondents argued that the applicant's by-law violated their rights under s. 2(b) of the Charter. Application allowed; respondents directed to remove the ground sign; if the sign is not removed within fifteen days, the Town can enter upon the land and remove the sign at the expense of the respondents. Although advertising is a form of expression and falls within the scope of sec. 2(b) of the Charter, the purposes of the by-laws (maintaining a distinct aesthetic character of the downtown, minimizing adverse impacts on adjacent properties and reducing safety concerns) were both pressing and substantial and the limiting measures were rationally connected to the objectives. The by-laws had a minimal impairment on the rights of the respondents, as advertising was not prohibited but only limited.","The Town applied pursuant to s266 of the Municipal Government Act for the removal of a ground sign erected in the Town's downtown core zone. It was alleged that the by-laws restricted the respondents’ freedom of expression by prohibiting overly large billboard type signs and by reducing the proliferation of signs with the requirement that the signs relate to the property on which they are located. The by-law also prohibited the use of signs in the business district, minimizing the adverse impacts of signs on adjacent properties and the street scape. The Town contended that the By-laws were rationally connected to the objective and that the means used by the municipality to achieve its goal were reasonable and proportionate to the infringement of the appellant’s right of free expression. HELD: The application was allowed and an order of an order was issued directing the respondents to remove the ground sign. If not removed within 15 days, the Town can enter upon the land and remove the sign at the expense of the respondents. Costs will be awarded at $1,500 against all respondents. 1)The limiting measures of the bylaw are rational and are rational. They ensure the orderly development of commercial land use while still achieving its objectives and which objectives are benefit for the community. It is not a complete prohibition of signs. It lists signs which are permitted in all zones and for which no permit is required. Primarily restrictions regulate how and where signs can be displaced and those limitations do not prevent advertising in the downtown core area. Sign restrictions for ancillary uses can be regarded as an integral part of the pressing and substantial objective of orderly city development through urban planning. Regulation of land use to ensure the health, welfare and general well-being of the inhabitants is of primary importance. 2) The limiting measures are rational as they are based on preserving and facilitating the Town’S planning goals and they are of benefit to the other citizens of the community, such as reducing the number of signs per square foot and preventing distraction to motorists. 3) There was no question that in an urban industrial society it is desirable to regulate the erection of signs both from the point of view of the safety of motorists and pedestrians and from the vantage point of maintaining the attractiveness of community. The objectives are urgent and are found to be substantial within the meaning of s. 2(b) of the Charter. The limits imposed on the rights and freedoms guaranteed by ss.(b) and (c)of the Charter are demonstrably justified. 4) Costs were awarded against respondents."

6_2003skqb61.txt,"FIAT. An application by two siblings to act as personal decision makers and property guardians for their 68 year old mother, who suffers from Alzheimer's. Although their four siblings consented, the Public Trustee opposed their appointment as property guardians without a bond. This is one of a number of cases similarly contested by the Public Trustee since the Adult Guardianship and Co-Decision-Making Act was proclaimed July 15, 2001. Under the previous Dependent Adults Act, the Public Trustee was not served with notices of and did not intervene in applications for property guardianship and the practice for when a bond was required was ad hoc. The prescribed amount by regulation is $10,000. Arguments advanced by applicants generally is that a bond is expensive; in many cases the proposed applicants do not have adequate assets, which equal or exceed the value of the estate; the court has the power under the Adult Guardianship and Co-Decision-Making Act s.47(1)(a) to place any limitations or conditions on the guardianship it considers appropriate. HELD: The application to be appointed personal decision makers was granted. No order was made with respect to the application for property guardianship. The requirement for a bond is mandatory under the new Act as indicated by the use of the word 'shall' unless an applicant can qualify for dispensation under s.55(4). Under s.55(4)(b), it is no longer adequate for the nearest relatives to consent to the appointment. The only discretion is in s.55(4)(c) where the court may dispense with a bond in any other situation the court considers appropriate. Reading the section as a whole and bearing in mind both its purpose, context and historical evolution, the word 'appropriate' means suitable or appropriate for the end in view, which is to ensure the adult's estate remains intact during the guardianship, or can be restored in the event it does not. To consider this an appropriate case to dispense with a bond would be to largely negate the mandatory requirement for the filing of a bond contained in s.55(1).","FIAT: This application by two siblings to act as personal decision-maker and property guardian for their 68-year old mother was opposed by the Public Trustee insofar as they request they be appointed property guardians without the necessity of a bond. HELD: 1) Unlike the previous legislation, the requirement for bond is mandatory as indicated by the public trustee, which is why it was given a larger role to play in the new legislation and why the discretion of the court to appoint a property guardian without the need for a bond was very much restricted in the old legislation.  2) One answer is to request the Public trustee to become the property guardian pursuant to s. 30(b). The fees charged by thepublic trustee are set out in Regulation to The Public Guardian and Trustee Act and are not to be paid from time to time. 3) The public trustee should be consulted in advance of the Court application being served as well as filed as to whether there is any common ground on the type of surety that would be acceptable, including the financial disclosure required to support the same, or to determine if in the court's opinion it is appropriate to dispense with a bond in the circumstances with the result that the court is prepared to consent to the application.  4) The application to be appointed personal decision makers is in order and an order may issue with the authorities identified in the draft order submitted."
6_1999canlii12377.txt,"A charge of failing to yield, contrary to s.50(3) of the Highway Traffic Act. The collision caused extensive damage to the defendant's vehicle and totaled the second. Two passengers were knocked unconscious. One sustained a bruised collar bone and the other required stitches to the head. HELD: The defendant was found not guilty. His action did not fall short of the standard of care demanded of ordinary prudent drivers faced with similar circumstances. The defence of due diligence was established with respect to the failing to yield. The second requirement of s.50(3) is that the defendant shall not make a turn until he has afforded a reasonable opportunity to the approaching vehicle to avoid a collision. It was found as a fact that that when he commenced his turn, any lawfully vehicle approaching from the opposite direction would have been able to avoid the collision.  1)Since the defendant turned across the path of the on-coming vehicle and since they came into collision, it would appear prima facie that he failed to yield as required by s.50(3). The right of way, however, is not absolute. As most regulatory offences s. 50(3) is an offence of strict liability which means that once it is established the defendant did the prohibited act, it is open to him to establish a defence of due diligence on a balance of probabilities. 2)Speeding by the second vehicle was a contributing factor. It could not be determined whether the second vehicle had only its parking lights on. Neither road nor weather conditions appeared to have been a factor. Alcohol was not a factor. Visibility was reasonably good given the time of day and the fact the intersection was lit by street lights. 3)When the defendant commenced his turn across the path of the second vehicle he was entitled to assume it was safe to do so as there did not appear to be any other vehicle close enough to the intersection to present a hazard.","This was a charge of failing to yield contrary to s. 50(3) of the Highway Traffic Act. The defendant had stopped at an intersection for 15 seconds to allow several south-bound vehicles to go by, and then began his left turn. When the defendant turned across the path of the other vehicle, and the two vehicles came into collision, it would appear prima facie that he failed to yield as he was required to do so. The court found that the defendant's actions did not fall short of the standard of care demanded of ordinary drivers faced with similar circumstances, and that with respect to the failure to yield the defence of due diligence was established."
c_2007skqb269.txt,"FIAT: The applicants are residents of Wilcox and have children attending the Wilcox school. They seek an interlocutory mandatory injunction preventing the respondent Board of Education from acting upon a resolution that the Wilcox school be closed. HELD: Both with respect to the statutory breach of the 28-day notice period for the meeting to elect school community council members, and the ground of lack of procedural fairness, the Court concluded the applicants failed to meet the standard of a strong prima facie case. 1) A review of the facts and the law suggest that the applicant's submission on the fact that the notice for election of the school community council was 2 days short of the 28 days required by The Education Act does not meet the test of a strong prima facie case. The Act does not state that non-compliance with formalities will result in a nullity. There was no prejudice caused by the non-compliance with the 28-day notice period before the election of members to the school community council. There is no evidence or suggestion that a different school council would have been elected if the extra 2 days notice had been provided. No one complained at the time and the fact the matter is raised now amounts to a collateral attack on that election. The potential consequences of a Court finding of a nullity militate against such a finding. The relevance of the school community council in the closure of a school arises after the decision to close the school has been made. To nullify all of the process and consultation that went into the school closure on this collateral ground would have serious consequences of causing at least one year delay in the efficiencies or improvements in student education which motivated the decision, and result in a loss of time, energy and money expended in the process. 2) Taking into account the mandate of the Board under the Act with respect to school closures, the consultation process adopted by the Board, and the manner in which it conducted the consultation meetings does not lead to the conclusion the procedure was unfair. A review of the five factors identified by the Supreme Court in Baker v. Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration) does not favour an overly stringent application of the procedural fairness rules in this matter.","FIAT: The applicants seek an interlocutory mandatory injunction preventing and restraining the respondent Board of Education from acting upon a resolution passed by the Board on May 7, 2007 that the Wilcox Public School be closed effective August 15, 2007. The grounds for the application are that the Board provided inadequate notice of an election for the Wilco school community council and it is alleged the election is nullity. As result there was no council for the Board to consult with as required by The Education Act, 1995. The court also notes that the respondent failed to comply with the requirements of procedural fairness in the manner in which they proceeded to pass the resolution closing the school. HELD: 1) A preliminary review of the facts and law does not suggest a strong prima facie case. 2) Procedural fairness is an appropriate standard to apply in cases where the factual record is largely settled prior to the application being made. 3) The three criteria to be assessed when considering whether or not a mandatory injunction should issue are the merits of the case, whether there is a serious question to be tried, whether the Board has met its obligations under the Act, and whether the issuance of an injunction would create greater harm to the respondent."
2_2004skqb62.txt,"FIAT: The issue to be resolved was whether the petitioner had produced all relevant financial information in order for the Court to determine the amount of maintenance to be paid by her. HELD: The application was dismissed with costs in the amount of $500 to the petitioner. Neither the petitioner's father nor the petitioner's husband was a party to the proceedings. To require them to produce their financial records, in the absence of even the slightest evidence such production would disclose anything which would in any manner assist in determining the amount of child maintenance payable by the petitioner, would be totally unjust.","FIAT. When the 1999 judgment was amended to provide that the primary residence of the child should be with her father, the question of the payment of maintenance by the mother was adjourned pending fulfilment of the requirement that she produce all information relating to her ability to pay maintenance and for her examination by the respondent to determine her income. HELD: The examination was completed and by agreement of counsel the questions to be resolved were whether the mother had produced all relevant financial information, and whether a trial should be directed as to the amount of maintenance payable by her. Counsel for Mr. Overs submitted that the financial records of the trucking corporation, owned by his sister, should be disclosed as they were not kept in the respondent's home and did not have the filing information required for their examination. Whether that submission had any merit was to be heard at viva voce hearing. Neither counsel could find anything to support the assertion that the petitioner should be required to produce her father's business records or to obtain full particulars of the cattle operation in which the petitioner was engaged or the petitioner's income was being canvassed would be determined because the petitioner could not find anything of the sort which would assist the respondent in determining her entitlement to child support. Neither the petitioner nor the respondent could afford to pursue such a course.HELD: Both applications were dismissed with costs of $500 to the petitioner."
e_2010skpc130.txt,"Defence sought an adjournment of a preliminary hearing to call a police accident reconstructionist as a witness. Prior to the commencement of the hearing, defence counsel was aware that the Crown did not intend to call this person as part of its case. One month prior to the preliminary hearing, defence counsel requested that the accident reconstructionist be made available as witness. The Crown advised defence that the officer was out of the country on peace keeping mission. The officer was expected back within months of the commencement of the preliminary hearing. HELD: The defence request for an adjournment was granted. The Court could not be satisfied that the officer was not a material witness to the preliminary inquiry. The Court was not satisfied that defence was guilty of neglect in failing to procure the officer's attendance when they had been advised by the Crown that he was out of the country. The length of the adjournment would not be lengthy.","The accused was charged with committing an offence under s. 254(5) of the Criminal Code and, at the time of committing the offence knew or ought to have known that his operation of the motor vehicle caused an accident resulting in bodily harm to another person. The Crown had refused to call any of the witnesses it had called. The accused came before the Court for preliminary inquiry on July 26, 2010. After the Crown called all of their witnesses, asked Defence Counsel if they had any witnesses to call on the preliminary inquiry and he advised that he wished to call Sergeant Barbar as a witness. Defence Counsel opposed the adjournment request. HELD: The Court granted the request for an adjournment so that the Defence could make arrangements to have Sergeant Barbar available for the preliminary hearing. The Court was satisfied that there was a reasonable expectation that the accused would be called as their witness. The Defence was not negligent in procuring the attendance of Sergeant Barbar. The evidence adduced at preliminary inquiry does not reflect the whole of the evidence which will be presented at trial nor does it reflect the strength of the Crown's case at trial."
e_2014skpc35.txt,"The Crown found the accused not guilty. With respect to the issue of identification, it held that the officer was empowered by s. 209.1(2)(a) of The Traffic Safety Act to require an operator of a motor vehicle to provide his name and address. The accused had admitted that the statement given was voluntary. Although there had been no identification in Court, the officer had seen the accused operating a motor vehicle and had properly obtained his name and date of birth. That person was arrested and released on an appearance notice. Counsel for the accused appeared on the scheduled date and entered a guilty plea and then appeared on the trial date and the accused was noted as present. All of these facts constituted prima facie proof of identity. Regarding the other issues, the Court held that notice under s. 260(6) of the Code can be given to counsel of record without proof that counsel consented to the receipt of such notice. However, the Crown had not established that proper notice was given either to the accused or his counsel as required by s. 260(5), either by way of viva voce or affidavit evidence from the person effecting service or an admission of counsel. Without such compliance with s. 260(6), the certificate was not admissible in evidence. There was no other evidence of disqualification and no evidence as to the nature of the disqualification on which the Court could conclude that a s. 259 offence had been committed.",The accused was charged with driving while disqualified contrary to s. 259(4) of the Criminal Code. The evidence was straightforward and uncontradicted. The only evidence was whether an in-court identification was necessary; there was no evidence that proper notice had been given of the two documents tendered by the Crown and service on a lawyer did not satisfy the notice requirement if counsel never agreed to accept service. HELD: The Court found that the accused's identity was established. The Certificate of Disqualification and Notice of Intention was designated as Exhibit P-1 for identification and letter from SGI directed to the accused was marked as Exhibit D-2 for identification. The circle of identification was complete and the person to whom the accused gave the appearance notice was the offender. The Court had no doubt whatsoever that the person named on the Appearance Notice was the same person who had stood trial.
e_1999skqb106.txt,"FIAT. One of the nine plaintiffs, legal representatives of passengers killed in a helicopter crash in 1995, and two defendants sought better testimonial and documentary discovery. Objections to questions or to the production of documents at the examinations for discovery fell under relevance and privilege. The plaintiffs alleged the defendants carried on a negligent and reckless shuttle service to and from the work site and that the Cameco group could not avoid liability by reason of having hired the Kyrgyzstan National Airline as an independent contractor. HELD: 1)Relevancy. The plaintiffs were entitled to question officers of the corporations and receive production of all documents touching on the issues of why the helicopter and the airline were selected; who made these decisions and whether KOC was the alter ego or agent for Cameco in this respect; whether the airline was unsafe; if so, should any of the defendants have known it was unsafe; was it inherently dangerous; and if so, could the defendants rely on the independent contractor defence. Questions relating to availability, cost and reliability of alternative forms of transportation were logically relevant. Questions as to topography were relevant as background information and supported the allegation the shuttle was inherently dangerous. Whether the project was over budget was relevant but the budget itself was not. Although questions directed at whether insurance was arranged and by whom were to be answered, the information is not automatically admissible at trial. Questions relating to the e-mail system and when survival gear was placed on board were properly answerable. Records as to when the tickets were reserved and purchased were to be produced. Counsel is not required to justify why every particular question is asked. The relationship between Cameco and it various subsidiaries was in issue and the information as to when the president met certain people was broadly relevant. Leave was granted to reapply for direction. 2)Privilege:(a)The defendants were ordered to date any document for which privilege was claimed. The document must be sufficiently identified to allow the opposing party to assess whether the claim for privilege should be challenged. (b)The request for names of the persons who prepared documents was simply an attempt to investigate the investigation and was not permitted. The Rules of Court do not require the names of expert witnesses who prepared reports for which privilege is claimed. The same rationale applies to non- expert privileged memoranda. (c)Pre-accident observations disclosed to someone in the subsequent privileged investigation are disclosable. The plaintiff is entitled to ask the name of any employee who expressed safety concerns about the shuttle prior to the accident. While matters of opinion only, such concerns are disclosable. A reciprocal order with respect to the names of potential witnesses was made in favour of the defendants. (d)Litigation privilege attaches only until such time as party determines to utilize the document at trial. Under the Rules of Court party must disclose any such document and produce any existing expert reports prior to the pre-trial conference. (e)The report on safety equipment and survival gear prepared by the KOC Safety Superintendent was to be reviewed by the court to assess whether or to what extent it was privileged. It was not known whether the Report prepared after litigation included matters other than what the Superintendent was requested to report on prior to the accident. (f)It was ordered that information given by a former senior level KOC employee would not amount to a breach of the confidentiality agreement. The agreement not to disclose any proprietary information, including business information, was broad enough to include privileged investigations carried out by the employer. Counsel for KOC and Kilborn were permitted to be present at the interview. (g)The chronology document was privileged on the basis it represented the product of a privileged investigation. 3)The necessary criteria under Rule 222(a) was not established to justify examining for discovery the two former employees. The request to explore post accident conduct of senior executives was dismissed. Seeking to establish alternate forms of transportation was irrelevant to the issues. 4)Particulars of the statutes and regulations referred to in the statement of claim, sought under Rule 142, were to be supplied within 45 days. 5)The question asking the spouse if in her opinion her husband would have boarded an aircraft he felt was unsafe was improper as framed. The question was relevant only to character. Character evidence is limited to reputation in the community and does not allow for personal opinion. 6)There was no order as to costs as success was mixed.","The plaintiff corporations brought an action against the defendants for negligent and reckless helicopter shuttle operation to and from the work site. The defendants claimed liability insurance for the loss of nine of the 11 crew members who died when their helicopter collided with the plaintiff's vehicle. The plaintiff sought to have the defendants answer questions as to when airfare tickets were reserved, the cost of such tickets, and the date of their use were to be disclosed. The defendant refused to answer whether liability insurance was obtained through KOC or Cameco. HELD: The application was dismissed with costs.  1)The only significance of the plaintiffs identifying the theories they may hold behind any questioning with respect to these issues is that by disclosing the theory it is easier to determine whether such questioning is or could be logically relevant to a fact or position in issue. In any event the report of the safety officer at the main camp site is not privileged because he was requested to prepare a safety report prior to the accident but did not get around to it until after the accident. 2)A detailed perusal of documents will suggest the possibility of these theories. The only issue is whether the predominant purpose of all such memoranda and expert reports was contemplated litigation as opposed to the prevention of another similar accident in the future. 3)A number of documents relating to the availability of alternative forms of transportation were not properly identified. The claimed privilege is too broad and prevents him from ascertaining the names of potential witnesses, which may result in him being taken by surprise at trial. Questions related to the e-mail system are properly answerable.  4)The plaintiffs were awarded leave to reapply for direction.  5)The Saskatchewan Evidence Act defines'record' as any information that is recorded or stored by means of any device, including a computer. 6)The report of Mr. Eric Rast who was safety officer was not privileged for the simple reason that until such a date is known it cannot be known whether such records are in existence during the relevant period of time. 7)The plaintiff was entitled to seek further direction on this issue."

In the second application the mother sought to have the paragraph in the 1994 order restraining the parents from removing the children from the province without the other's written consent or court order struck. HELD: 1)The mother was advised to apply by notice of motion with appropriate supporting affidavits.  2)The arrears were $11,838.39 as the father had paid money directly which was not accounted for in the Statement of Arrears. Since the Guidelines were not in force prior to 1997, they do not automatically apply to a support payable prior to 1997. The father's income was sufficient for him to pay child support for 1996 and 1997. Arrears for 1993 to 1995 inclusive were reduced as he was not able to pay according to the order at those times. Upon payment of $5,000 the balance of arrears accrued prior to December 31/98 would be extinguished. 3)The father was to pay child support of $325 per month for the two children. Garnishment of his wages by the Maintenance Enforcement Office were to be limited to $175 per month for arrears plus the current maintenance due. 4)The parties agreed the father should have access not less than one full weekend per month upon two weeks prior notice plus when he was available to attend at the city in a manner consistent with the children's best interests and their need to be available for school.","Two applications before the Court under the Family Maintenance Act s.10 seeking an order providing for the relief of varying the child maintenance payable pursuant to the 1993 order by reducing the maintenance payable from $250 per month for each of the three children to the amounts specified under the Federal Child Support Guidelines as adopted by the Act; cancelling the arrears of $13,273.39 in maintenance payments accrued under the order; and varying access provisions of the order with the view of providing him with greater access to the children. HELD: 1) The respondent was not in a position to pay the full monthly maintenance provided by the Order. The principles of law governing child support for infant children are well-known and specifically provided in The Guidelines and The Act. 2) Both parties are restrained from removing the children from the Province of Saskatchewan without the written consent of the other party or an order of this Court. With respect to the first issue, the Court was not prepared to hear her application and advised her to apply by notice motion with appropriate supporting affidavits. 3) On the second issue the court was satisfied that the respondent should have access not less than one full weekend per month between 6:00 p.m. on Friday to 3:00 pm on Sunday and two weeks prior notice together plus other periods of time when he is available to attend at Saskatoon for the purpose of exercising access in a manner consistent with the best interest of the children including their need to be available for school. 4) The petitioner did not proceed by way of notice motion nor did she filed appropriate affidavit evidence in support of her application.

d_2001nssc18.txt,"The grievor was employed in the front desk department of a hotel and her hours of work were reduced when another employee from the same department returned from maternity leave. The latter had greater departmental seniority than the grievor but less hotel seniority. The grievor filed a grievance claiming that under the collective agreement any such reduction of hours of individual employees should be based on hotel seniority, rather than departmental seniority. The arbitrator upheld the grievance and the hotel applied for judicial review. Application allowed; the arbitrator's interpretation of the collective agreement was patently unreasonable and her award should be set aside. The court's focus must be on the existence of a rational basis for the decision of the tribunal and not on whether it agrees with the decision. Although there was evidentiary support for the arbitrator's essential findings of fact, no logical process could be ascertained by which the final conclusion drawn from the evidentiary foundation was made.","An application for judicial review of a labour arbitrator's decision that the wording of collective agreement was wide enough to encompass the situation. The court found that the arbitrator’s decision was patently unreasonable. It was not reasonable to assume that anyone with more departmental seniority would benefit from the reduction in work hours because another employee with greater departmental strength returned from maternity leave. The arbitrator found that this was not a lay-off situation. Rather, an indefinite reduction of hours occurred, not by reason of Ms. MacMaster leaving her position but by scheduling related events and promotions. The appellant was the first to experience a reduction in her work hours. She subsequently filed a grievance alleging that the reduction was caused by personnel change. She sought allotment of work hours based on her hotel seniority and recovery of her loss of wages. She also alleged that the delay in her leave had resulted in a reduction of the number of hours available for work in the front desk department by virtue of her being the first one to experience such a reduction. She argued that the exclusion of overtime, promotions, overtime and vacation allocation were dealt with by way of departmental levelity and the reduction of overall hours within the department was due to personnel change rather than from a layoff. She alleged that Article 9:01 can reasonably be given an interpretation that has the potential to detrimentally affect employees returning to maternity leave, depending on their standing of seniority. The appeal was allowed on the basis that the interpretation of the arbitration arbitrator was not patently reasonable and was not inconsistent with the presumed intention of the parties."
b_2014skca82.txt,"The Crown did not meet the onus under s. 676(1)(a) of the Criminal Code, and therefore the appeal was dismissed. The Appeal Court found that the Crown must satisfy the court of two things: 1) that an error of law was made on the standard of correctness; and 2) that the error had a material bearing on the acquittal. The Court of Appeal dealt with the Crown’s arguments as follows: 1) while it is an error to mistake the elements of an offence the Court found that the trial judge did not do so. The trial judge did, unfortunately, state that the speed needed to be proved beyond a reasonable doubt but the trial judge did not confuse the factual speed issue with either the mens rea or actus reus; 2) the trial judge thoroughly reviewed each of the witnesses’ testimony. The trial judge did not have to refer to every piece of evidence or explain exactly how each piece of evidence was weighed or considered in the reasons; and 3) the trial judge did err in applying the criminal standard of proof beyond a reasonable doubt to the different pieces of evidence going to the vehicle’s speed. The trial judge concluded that the minimum speed must be accepted because the higher speeds were not proven beyond a reasonable doubt. The Court of Appeal concluded that the verdict would not have necessarily been different but for the error in law; speed was the only driving factor suggested to be dangerous. The Crown also questioned the admissibility of the analyst’s opinion evidence on appeal, although they did not at trial. The Crown was not allowed to raise arguments on appeal that were not raised at trial. The analyst was originally a Crown witness at the preliminary inquiry and then he was a defence witness at trial. Further, the Appeal Court declined to give an opinion on the weight that should have been given to the analyst’s testimony because that was a question of fact for the trial judge.","The Crown appeals the acquittal of the respondent from a charge of dangerous driving causing bodily harm contrary to s. 249(3) of the Criminal Code. The Crown was tried on this charge before judge alone and was acquitted on October 10, 2013. The respondent was acquitted of the charge. In this appeal the Crown argues that the trial judge did not consider that the appellant's speed was anything more than 93 to 99 kilometres per hour or that it was objectively dangerous in all the circumstances. HELD: The appeal is dismissed. 1) The Crown has failed to overcome the heavy onus required to overturn appeals from acquittals under s. 676(1)(a). 2) The trial judge correctly stated and applied the elements of the dangerous driving. 3) The Court was not satisfied that the Crown has established beyond a reasonable doubt that the accused's speed needed to be proved beyond reasonable doubt. He went beyond merely considering whether the appellant was in a construction zone and accepted as fact that there were no construction workers or equipment in the area."
2001skqb148.txt,"FIAT. The infant complainants, who alleged sexual assault and other offences, failed to identify the plaintiff, a former police officer, and a stay of proceedings was entered in 1993.  The plaintiff commenced an action in 1994 for malicious prosecution, negligence, conspiracy and breach of Charter rights and claimed general, specific, punitive and aggravated damages, interest and costs.  Two motions to dismiss the plaintiff's claim were brought under Queen's Bench Rules 173(a) and 188, plus Rule 173(e) in the motion brought by the two chiefs of police. The plaintiff sought several orders in a third motion, two of which were granted summarily; one was adjourned sine die. The applicants submitted the action should be struck, except for claims based on malice, because it was not commenced within the time prescribed by the Public Officers' Protection Act (POPA). Referring to the 2 year and 6 year limitation periods prescribed by s.3(1)(d) and (j) of the Limitations of Actions Act (LAA), the applicants argued a retroactive order for further time was prohibited because a second limitation period had expired. The substantive issues were whether the plaintiff's claim was barred by statutory limitation periods; whether any limitation period should be extended nunc pro tunc; whether a portion of the plaintiff's claim failed to disclose a cause of action against five of the defendants because there was no allegation of malice; whether the plaintiff's claim in tort against the Government of Saskatchewan was barred by statute. HELD: 1)The time to bring the action was extended to September 10, 1994, retroactive to September 8, 1994. The applications to have the action dismissed as having been commenced beyond the statutory limitation period were dismissed. Whether the limitation period was extended was best determined at trial. It was not certain the limitation period was not extended as the statement of claim alluded to subsequent conduct by some defendants. As a general rule, the statutory limitation period created by s.2(1)(a) of the POPA commences to run when a stay of proceedings is entered pursuant to s.579 of the Criminal Code. Although a stay has been entered, actionable conduct of a public officer may continue. The only limitation period applicable in this case is s.2(1) of the POPA. Limitation periods are substantive in character, as opposed to procedural. The LAA does not supersede or replace s.2 of the POPA. The intent and purpose of the LAA is to avoid conflict with other legislation by removing its application from situations specifically dealt with by other legislation. The limitation in the POPA is not necessarily absolute. 2)The application by the chiefs of police to strike the claim in negligence was dismissed. The position in Beckstead v. Ottawa and Reynen v. Canada was adopted. The immunity in s.10 of the Police Act does not extend protection to police officers in general. 3)The claim in negligence against the other defendants was struck without prejudice to amend pleadings. The pleadings as to the Crown Attorneys were struck. They could not be saved, absent an allegation of moral turpitude implicit in malice, bad faith or improper purpose. 4)The Government's application was granted in part, such that all the claims were dismissed except those alleging conspiracy and Charter breaches. The Crown does not enjoy absolute immunity and must bring itself within s.5(6)(a) or (b) of the Proceedings Against the Crown Act which will depend on the particular facts. Immunity does exist for malicious prosecution and negligence. If the decision to prosecute is protected, then the conduct in carrying out the decision should be afforded the same protection. A claim for negligence could not be maintained against the government as employer where it was struck against the Crown Attorneys. Leave to amend pleadings was not entertained as the plaintiff failed to give advance notice.  5)The two applications based on Rule 188 providing for a determination of a point of law were dismissed as there was a factual component. An order should not be granted under Rule 188 in the absence of an agreed statement of fact. 6)The plaintiff demonstrated a prima facie cause of action; provided a reasonable explanation for the delay given the circumstances and his emotional and mental state at the time; and no prejudice will flow to the defendants as they had all actively participated in the litigation from the outset. The only reasonable course was to grant a retroactive order given the time, effort and money already expended. It was not appropriate to require the action be commenced anew.  7)No costs.","Three motions were brought pursuant to Queen's Bench Rule 173(a) and 188. The motions sought an order pursuant to the Rules of the Public Officers' Protection Act and an extension of a limitation period nunc pro tunc. With the consent of the plaintiff, the Court ordered that the action against the Attorney General be dismissed. The remaining substantive issues were whether the plaintiff's claim was barred by a statutory limitation period, whether the limitation period should be extended, and whether a portion of the claim failed to disclose a cause of action. HELD: The applications were dismissed with costs under double Column V and the other issues were set aside. 1)The limitation period did not commence to run until after the expiration of the 1 year limitation period. The limitation period was not extended. 2)The Court was of the view that it was improper to dismiss the claim simply because it was a factual component and absent an agreed statement of facts there should not be an order granted under Rule 188. 3)Limitation of actions were substantive in character as opposed to procedural. Section 579(2) of the Code allows the Crown to recommence criminal prosecution during a period of 1 year from the date the stay is entered without the necessity of laying new Information or preferring a new indictment. 4)The limitations period was extended by a factor of 1 years. 5)Limitations on action relating to breaches of duty, breaches of duties, misrepresentation and other causes of action were not limited to events prior to the entering of a stay of proceedings by the Crown. 6)Statutes of fact are not to be confused with statements of facts. The Act does not alter the substantive rights of the parties to proceed pro rata."
b_1996canlii5058.txt,"The issue was whether $10,000 payable under a GIC was subject to garnishee as a debt due or accruing due within the meaning of s5(1) of the Attachment of Debts Act. The Bank had served a garnishee summons on First Line seeking to attach money owing to David. First Line paid nothing because the debt was not payable until its maturity. When the debtor died First Line paid the money to his estate. Relying on Tradewinds, the chambers judge dismissed the Bank's application. The appeal turned on whether the debt was accruing due or whether it was a conditional debt because it could be assigned. HELD: The appeal was allowed. The GIC was attachable pursuant to s5(1) of the Attachment of Debts Act.  1)The main point was whether the debt was not attachable because it was not accruing due when the garnishee summons was served in that it did not bind the debt. 2)The leading authority, Webb v. Stenton, concluded that existing debts payable in the future are attachable. 3)The garnishability of the debt owing under a promissory note is not prevented because the debt is conditional by reason of the possibility of assignment.  4)Saskatchewan courts have followed Bel-Fran holding that a term deposit is attachable. The only exception is Tradewinds which overlooked the aspect of s5(1) which permits attaching of debts which are accruing due. Tradewinds is contrary to Spiritwood and misapplies the law summarized in Barsi v. Farcas. The historic review demonstrated that there have been gradual changes in the law of garnishment. Based on the cases reviewed the assignability of a GIC is not the type of condition which has been held to affect the determination that a debt is accruing due. 5)Because of the early payment to the estate there were no intervening claims and no priority issue arose. It would be inappropriate to deny judgment in the circumstances. DISSENT: The appeal would be dismissed for reasons other than those reached by the chambers judge. 1)The statement that the creditor cannot be in a better position than the debtor to demand payment under the GIC is probably correct but was not a factor as the Bank was not seeking payment before its maturity date. The Bank's position was the debt had been garnisheed and payment should have been made to the Bank on maturity. 2)The chamber judge's comment that the Bank could have seized the GIC under execution and then had it sold by the sheriff was obiter. 3)The debt was a present debt due on its maturity date and therefore qualified as one that was accruing due. 4)Whether it was conditional depended upon whether the opportunity of assignment constitutes a conditional obligation. There is no significant difference between a promissory note and a GIC as they both contain a promise to pay a sum certain at a designated date. 5)Some jurisdictions specifically provide that a debt payable within six years of the service of the garnishee is garnishable.","Whether money owed under a guaranteed investment certificate (GIC) is debt 'accruing due' under s. 5(1) of the Attachment of Debts Act or subject to garnishment cannot be determined by reference only to garnishability of promissory notes not yet due. Other cases pertaining to similar debts must also be rationalized. Here, the conditional nature of the debt under the GIC was not a conditional one and therefore not garnishable."
e_2007skqb174.txt,"The respondent father applied by way of notice of motion to vary a custody judgment that provided for joint custody of the child with shared parenting according to a specified schedule. The grounds for the application were that the mother had failed to abide by the terms of the original judgment and had refused to provide the father with any information as to the location of herself and the child since the date of that judgment. The mother had left Saskatoon, taking the child with her and, subsequent to police involvement and several Court orders to assist in locating the child, was arrested on Canada-wide warrant in Edmonton, Alberta and charged pursuant to ss. 281(1) and 283 of the Criminal Code of Canada with child abduction and contravention of custody order. The applicant submitted that the mother had placed the child at risk of harm and accordingly it was in the best interests of the child that the father be granted sole custody. The applicant also requested an order providing only supervised access to the child by the mother. The father filed a further application seeking an order allowing him to relocate the child to Whitehorse, Yukon, for residential purposes. The mother opposed the father's application for relocation, and prayed that she be granted less restrictive access to the child. The issues were as follows. 1) Should the father be granted sole custody of the child? 2) Should the father be allowed to relocate with the child to Whitehorse, Yukon? 3) What access to the child should be granted to the mother? HELD: Application allowed. The father shall have the costs of the trial on party and party basis. 1) The starting point for the Court's review is whether the father has demonstrated material change in the circumstances affecting the child. The Court is satisfied that there has been a material change in the circumstances that existed at the time of the original custody judgment when it was thought that the cooperation of the parties necessary for joint custody was possible. As the mother has demonstrated it was not, review of the order to determine whether change in custody or access order is in the best interests of the child, having regard to all of the circumstances of this case. Based on the original findings and the evidence at trial that the father has cared well for the child, as well as the mother's conduct in attempting to avoid shared parenting, the Court is satisfied that it is in the child's best interests to grant sole custody to the father. 2) The evidence at trial confirmed the seven points that the father outlined in support of the proposed relocation to Whitehorse. In reviewing each of seven factors set out in the case law and considering the best interests of the child, the Court approves the father's plan to relocate to Whitehorse. 3) It is in the child's best interests to continue the mother's existing access arrangements with the child until the child moves with the father to Yukon, at which time the new access arrangements set out in this decision will apply. Detailed orders are issued accordingly.","The respondent applied to vary the original custody judgment, which provided for joint custody of the child with shared parenting according to a specified schedule.

As the mother demonstrated that it was not, a fresh inquiry is embarked upon. 3) The Court would have been amenable to an application for sole custody to the mother with scheduled access if the mother had it been requested. There would be no disruption to the child consequent on removal from family, schools and the community he or she had come to know."
9_2004skqb324.txt,"Wal-Mart Canada applies for an order pursuant to Rule 664 and Rule 673 of The Queen's Bench Rules of Court quashing the orders of the Board. The orders require Wal-Mart Canada to discover and produce documents. Wal-Mart Canada says that the Board does not have the jurisdiction to use the subpoena or make the disclosure and productions orders in the manner in which it has done. Wal-Mart Canada also applies for an order declaring s. 9 of The Trade Union Act unconstitutional. HELD: The orders of the Board are quashed with costs payable forthwith to Wal-Mart Canada by UFCW. The application for an order declaring s. 9 of The Trade Union Act to be unconstitutional and of no force and effect is dismissed without prejudice to Wal-Mart Canada to bring its application back. 1) The Court concluded that a review of the transcript was essential to the proper determination of the issues raised by the application and that it must be considered part of the record.  2) The case law has determined that orders made by the Board that in reality are document discovery orders, are orders made without jurisdiction to which the applicable standard of review is one of correctness. 3) The Board abused its jurisdiction and power to issue the subpoena duces tecum in two respects. First the Board issued the subpoena without any prior consideration as the relevance of the documents that it compelled Wal-Mart Canada to produce. The subpoena was issued before the hearings commenced. There is no evidence that the Board exercised its discretion judicially in considering the issue of relevancy. It is unlikely that the Board even scrutinized the subpoena or it would have likely required the scope of it to be narrowed. Second, the subpoena was far too generalized and amounts to an order to discover documents. The Board must restrict its consideration to evidence that is relevant to the issues before it. It is precluded from making its decision on the basis of irrelevant or improper considerations. 4) The Board exceeded its jurisdiction and abused its power in making the discovery and production orders it did. The comments of the Court with respect to the subpoena duces tecum apply in principle to the Board's discovery and production orders. The orders were not production orders but directed Wal-Mart to comply with the subpoena duces tecum.  5) The requirement that evidence, including documentary evidence, be relevant before it can be properly considered, is a substantive issue that goes to the heart of the legitimacy of judicial or quasi-judicial dispute determination. It is an important consideration in determining whether there has been a denial of natural justice where there has been reliance on improper considerations rather than relevant evidence. 6) Some of the documents sought are in the possession and control of a third party non-resident American corporation. Additional factors and procedures should at least have been considered such as the 'likely relevance' of the documents to an issue. Solicitor and client privilege was raised with respect to some of the documents yet the Board ordered the production of those documents without ruling on the issue or without providing a means by which the confidentiality of the documents could be maintained until a ruling was made. 7) The Board has demonstrated a reluctance to give up its perceived powers of discovery despite two previous decisions of the Court of Queen's Bench and the Court of Appeal. If it interprets this decision of the Court in the same fashion, an order to reconsider the issues would be of little value to the applicant. The only feasible option is to grant the relief that is sought by quashing the two orders.  8) Wal-Mart Canada submits that the Board has already interpreted s.9 of The Trade Union Act very broadly so that its effect violates s. 2(d) of the Charter. Wal-Mart Canada submits this is evidenced in two ways. First, by the manner in which the Board has permitted the proceedings to be conducted and second, by the focus of the hearing on the alleged anti-union philosophy of Wal-Mart Canada instead of on whether or not Wal-Mart Canada has in fact influenced its employees to bring their applications against UFCW. If the Board has interpreted s. 9 of The Trade Union Act in accordance with UFCW's submissions, then such an interpretation appears to be on a collision course with s.2(d) of the Charter of Rights. If s. 9 of the Act has the effect of restricting freedom of expression between an employee and an employer that does not constitute interference or coercion, then s. 9 may well violate s. 2(d) of the Charter and if not saved by s. 1 of the Charter, is unconstitutional. However, Wal-Mart Canada's application respecting the constitutionality of s. 9 of the Act is premature in the sense that the Court did not have a sufficient factual foundation or context to properly measure s. 9 of the Act against s. 2(d) of the Charter.","Walgreens applied for an order quashing two orders of the Board made pursuant to Queen's Bench Rules 664 and 673 quashing them. The orders required Wal-Mart to discover and produce documents, including those referred to in a subpoena duces tecum. The order also required that the company comply with the discovery and production of documents sought by the union. The applicant objected to the subpoenas and sought the production of additional documents. The respondent denied having the authority to subpoena or make the disclosure and production orders but maintained that it had the jurisdiction to do indirectly what it could do directly. Wal- Mart Canada declined to comment on the offending provisions. HELD: A review of the transcript is essential to the proper determination of the issues raised by the application and to consider each aspect of the breach of Charter allegations. Counsel for the Board conceded that two exceptions were made to the general rule that error of law must appear on the face of the record. The third exception was that the Board did not have jurisdiction to authorize the plaintiff to discover documents in contravention of the previous rulings of the Saskatchewan courts that it was not without jurisdiction. The Board has incorporated the evidence into its orders within the exception outlined by Lord Denning in R. v. Northumberland Compensation Appeal Tribunal.  1) It is not in dispute that the board has adopted pragmatic and functional analysis in determining the applicable standard of review. The case law directs the court to adopt a pragmatic and Functional analysis. 2) There are virtually no reasons given by the Board in its written decision as to why it ordered each and every document, memo or communication sought by UFCW or to make production orders without considering the relevance of what is sought to be produced. It is beyond the scope of this judgment to review the relevancy or privilege of the affidavit evidence. 3) The portions would normally have been struck. 4) The application is adjourned to June 10, 2004 and continued on June 11, 2004. The hearing was adjourned for a further time. 5) The issues on appeal are summarized in the amended notice of motion and detailed legal brief filed by the parties. They ask that the Court consider whether the issue should be left to the exclusive jurisdiction of the tribunal or whether it is protected by s. 1, s. 2(d) of the Charter. They seek to attach the respondent's s. 9 Charter rights to the record and to compel the applicant to comply with certain of the provisions of the subpoena.

b_1996canlii5628.txt,"The plaintiff was terminated as a sales agent after being employed by the defendant for 26 years. As part of the termination package he received 14 months salary continuation. The plaintiff claimed that he had not received 'reasonable notice' and sought damages. He also claimed that he was owed arrears of salary at the time of his dismissal. The defendant argued that the plaintiff had failed to mitigate his damages. Dismissing the action, that the appropriate period of notice was in the range of 14 to 15 months. Since the calculation of a 'reasonable period of notice' is not an exact exercise, either period could have been justified. Thus, it could not be said that the 14 month period given by the defendant was unreasonable. Furthermore, the plaintiff was not owed any arrears. Finally, in view of a non-competition clause in the contract of employment, it was not unreasonable for the plaintiff not to have pursued employment with other insurance companies any more than he had.","The deceased sales agent, who had been with the defendant since 1965, was terminated as a sales agent with the result that the defendant, in a program it invited its agents to participate in, reduced the level of compensation on new policies written by the plaintiff and required him to accept the new compensation. For the deceased, that this was a month in arrears in respect to his pay. The non-competition clause in the defendant's compensation agreement provided for monthly compensation based on the 'book of repeat clients' as well as renewal compensation calculated in accordance with the average renewals for the prior month. The deceased's position was no longer available. The court rejected the deceased's submission that he did not pursue the possibility of alternative employment with enthusiasm or commitment, as he had prepared neither a resume nor sought a recommendation from his former employer in order to assist him in such a pursuit. On appeal, the Court of Appeal held that since the deceased had made little effort to secure alternative employment, he was not entitled to the benefit that he would have otherwise received in the first place, and that his current position was not available. Awarding the deceased 20 months salary as damages in lieu of $3,000, that the deceased did not make any effort to seek alternative employment."
4_2010nssc85.txt,"The parties were separated and had difficulty communicating. They were together for eight years, and had two children (ages six and three). The husband had interim care and sought sole custody/primary care, while the wife wanted shared custody (50/50). She alleged the husband was abusive. The evidence showed she unreasonably refused to cooperate with him in relation to matters concerning the children. Sole custody/primary care to the father, with access to the mother as per the interim arrangement (every second weekend and other times). The mother was not credible and her allegations of abuse unfounded. If a party expects the court to believe there was domestic abuse, their position on parenting should reflect that. Shared custody arrangements require cooperation and the ability to jointly plan. Similarly, joint custody requires a level of cooperation. A requirement to make decisions jointly is not in the children's best interests if it leads to conflict and creates a potential power imbalance. Looking at the nature and extent of the parents' conflict, sole custody is appropriate until there has been an established track record of respectful parenting.","The parties were married for approximately thirty years. They had two children, ages 18 and 18. The wife requested an equal time shared parenting arrangement with the children every second weekend. The husband objected that the wife was abusive of the children. The children were placed in the husband's sole care and custody. The nature and cause of conflict between the parties was that the spouses were unable to communicate effectively with each other and the children did not have access to the other parent's information. HELD: The court found that both parties were unable, at this stage in their relationship, to meet the basic requirements for successful shared parenting. While shared parenting is appropriate, it does not necessarily mean joint custody is in the child's best interest. Both parties have demonstrated a depressing lack of cooperation. This has resulted in the vitiation of virtually all direct communication between them. They do not meet face to face and do not talk on the phone. Their e-mails are curt at best. They use their children as messengers."

The hotel was convicted on one charge and the remaining charges were held in abeyance pending its appeal. The hotel sought an order staying the hearing scheduled by the Commission to review a decision of the Authority suspending the applicant's tavern permit for three days, pending disposal of the criminal charges. Grounds for a stay were that the Commission's hearing would prejudice its defence on the criminal charges because it will be necessary to call similar defence evidence with respect to each proceeding; secondly, it would be manifestly unfair to have a decision for a potential penalty imposed by the Commission which may be contradictory to a finding of fact and a determination of guilt on the same facts and information before the Provicial Court. HELD: The application was dismissed with costs. 1)The second ground raised a substantive issue and in any event was effectively disposed of by R. v. Wigglesworth. There was nothing inconsistent with the Commission considering a form of disqualification of the applicant's license or permit, while the state exercises its criminal law power with respect to the same set of facts. 2)The applicant failed to show any prejudice to its criminal defence. The disclosure of any defence in the Commission hearing will not result in any new facts that were not already known to the Crown.","FIAT. The applicant sought an order staying the hearings pending a decision of the respondent Authority to suspend the applicant's 'tavern permit' for a period of 3 days, until criminal charges arising out of the same facts wereposed of.

Thedisclosure of any defence in the Commission hearing was notgoing to result in any new facts that were not already known to it. 2)The Commission was not relying on conviction. It will have the onus of adducing evidence related to the alleged breaches of s. 112(1) of the Alcohol and Gaming Regulation Act, and presumably the defence will consist of denying one or more of the elements implicit in the allegations. 3)When an application such as this is brought, the Onus is on the applicant to show a degree of prejudice if the civil proceedings are not stayed. 4)The prejudice must exist after taking into account that evidence to be given by the party in a civil examination for discovery or trial has available the protection offered by the Canada Evidence Act, R.S.C. 1985, c. C-5 (s. 5(2)) and The Saskatchewan Evidence Act. It would be manifestly unfair to have a decision for potential penalty imposed by the Commission which may be contradictory to a finding of fact and determination of guilt on same facts and information before the Provincial Court.  5)The applicant failed to show any prejudice to its criminal defence if the Commissionhearing was allowed to take place as scheduled."
e_2008skqb84.txt,"The appellant appeals his conviction for common assault under s. 266 of the Criminal Code on the basis that his non-lawyer agent, Richard Klassen, provided him with ineffective assistance resulting in a miscarriage of justice. HELD: The appeal is dismissed. 1) Klassen's lack of ability by itself is not a ground for determining that a miscarriage of justice occurred. There was no unfairness in the trial process. The appellant was entitled to have Klassen represent him. He made that decision freely based on information fully at hand that he consciously chose to rely on. There was no procedural unfairness to the appellant. He did not get the standard of representation that a competent lawyer could provide but that came as a result of the decisions he freely made. On appeal the appellant cannot rely on the fact that the standard of representation received was not equal to that of a competent lawyer. 2) The tactical decision to attack the credibility of the complainant through challenge to the audio tape was personally approved by the appellant. The appellant saw many lawyers in the assault case. He did not have confidence in them and pursued his original line of defence through Klassen. The Court cannot see a miscarriage of justice as a result of the tactics of the appellant and Klassen. The evidence at trial and the fresh evidence offered by the appellant's testimony and his affidavit to not establish a miscarriage of justice that may have occurred outside of the appellant's choice of agent, which is the test in R. v. Romanowicz (1999), 138 C.C.C. (3d) 225 (Ont. C.A.).",HELD: The appeal was dismissed. The Court found that the appellant had not suffered a miscarriage of justice as a result of his non-lawyer agent’s ineffective assistance in the conduct of the trial. The matter was remitted to a jury to determine whether the appellant should have taken the position that he was entitled to representation by his lawyer on the basis that his in-laws had provided him with ineffective assistance. The fresh evidence was not directed to a factual issue decided by the trial judge but rather to obtaining an original remedy from this Court on the ground that the agent”s ineffectual assistance resulted in a miscarriageof justice. The law in this area is well established and there is little reason to embark on further analysis of the factors that might have led to the conclusion that the accused had not been entitled to fair representation.

e_2006nssc364.txt,"The plaintiff, while working as security officer in mall, was run down in the parking lot as he was pursuing shoplifter. The van that struck him, driven by second individual, was being used as getaway vehicle. The issue before the court was whether the agreed-upon damages were to be paid by the liability insurer of the registered owner of the vehicle (who was not the driver) or by the plaintiff's Section D (uninsured motorist) insurer. As the first defendant remained the registered owner of the vehicle at the relevant time and failed to rebut the statutory presumption that it was being operated by the second defendant (who had now disappeared) with his consent at that time, the vehicle's insurer was responsible to pay the plaintiff's damages. The action against the plaintiff's Section D insurer is dismissed. The case turned on numerous credibility issues as the registered owner of the vehicle professed to have sold it few days prior to the incident (although he maintained insurance on the vehicle for several months afterwards), and it was argued that the second defendant (whom the plaintiff had detained for shoplifting earlier that day) was not the driver of the vehicle.","The plaintiff, who was pursuing a shoplifter, was run down in a cross walk in a mall parking lot by the van that was being used as the getaway vehicle in the shoplifting heist. The plaintiff had insurance from his employer, ING, under his Section (uninsured motorist) coverage. When he returned to live in the mall, he sought to register ownership of another vehicle with the Registry of Motor Vehicles. His unsuccessful attempt was refused because the public record still showed he was the registered owner of the vehicle that had been involved in the hit and run incident. HELD: The plaintiff's evidence was replete with inconsistencies, contradictions, admitted poor memory and admitted lies in his earlier discovery evidence. The Court was unable to locate either of them.  1) The plaintiff acknowledged that he sold the van to a woman he had just picked up and wanted to exchange for drugs. He said he did not recall the date of the sale but that he recognized it by the distinguishing features earlier mentioned and promptly called the police to pass on its location and license number. 2) The only clear evidence before the court on the identity of the van is that of the plaintiff himself. His claim that the van was sold to the woman who supplied the drugs was rejected by his lawyer. He retained a lawyer to prepare a Statutory Declaration which he said he would present to the Court on December 7, 2000. It was this document that led the Court to conclude that the defendant had sold the vehicle to the plaintiff and that the plaintiff had no record of the transaction. It is pertinent to note that this statement was signed by the defendant, who is a 12 year old and lives in Dartmouth and has a residence there. He was in Dartmouth when the incident occurred. He did not recognize the defendant from the police photo line up entered in evidence as part of the police investigation file but he recognized him from the driver's license plate when he was alerted to the squeal of tires. The defendant was arrested and taken to the police station where he was charged with several offences under the Motor Vehicle Act. He also testified that he only stayed 5 to 10 minutes in the security office with the police during which time he took a five-minute standing ovation and then took a second look at the van once he was led to the court office. He stated that he was not satisfied with the defendant's version of events, but was satisfied that he had a valid and reliable explanation for the events leading up to the commission of the offence.  2) There"

HELD: The accused's Charter rights were not breached. 1) The strong odour of raw cannabis marijuana emanating from the interior of the accused's vehicle in itself amounted to reasonable grounds not only for lawful detention but also for arrest. 2) The officer was not in breach of the accused's Charter rights by asking her where she had been and how long she had been there. 3) On the arrest or detention of the accused, she was promptly informed of the reasons therefore and she was informed of her right to retain and instruct counsel without delay.","The accused was charged with possession and use of a weapon for the purpose of trafficking contrary to s. 5(2) of the Controlled Drugs and Substances Act and possession and sale of marijuana in the presence of a person over the age of 21.

All evidence obtained after the initial stop should be excluded.  1) Even the s. 7 Charter argument refers only to a count in the indictment. The police officers cannot reasonably be expected to avert their eyes from evidence of activity, whether criminal or otherwise, that could be observed by any vigilant member of the public. 2) Given the lessened expectation of privacy in an automobile, police officers are entitled and expected to utilize their senses during the course of their duties. Such sensing of emissions, aromas or odours and drawing sensible conclusions from their detection is entirely reasonable when considering whether reasonable and probable grounds exist for search. 3) The evidence established that the strong odour of raw cannabis in the accused's vehicle combined with the other indicators observed by him provide more than sufficient basis for reasonable grounds either for search or for arrest or for both."

This action was commenced after the change of solicitors and there was no suggestion that the subject matter of the action was ever the subject of any consultation between the defendant and its former solicitors. The applicant raised arguments about the confidential nature of its adjusting and investigation of loss claims and internal policy procedures and litigation strategies in relation to the denial of claims. HELD: The application was dismissed with costs to the respondent in any event of the cause. 1)In 1993 in a similar application respecting another member of the same law firm the judge ruled against the plaintiff. This was consistent with a similar attempt following the 1982 change of government.  2)The only identifiable strategy (or perhaps a tactic) adopted to date has been excessive delay requiring applications to force compliance with the Rules and two applications to deprive the plaintiff of its chosen legal representation. 3)Once it is determined that there is no actual knowledge of the case in question the onus to establish the existence of confidential information shifts to the party asserting the concern. 4)As the applicant is a public corporation it is doubtful it has or should have secret strategies with which to defeat persons claiming under its insurance scheme. It is entitled to have its own preordained policies in respect of disputed claims but if such policies exist they probably should be made known to the public for whose benefit the corporation exists.

b_2008skpc104.txt,"The accused was charged with resisting arrest contrary to s. 129(a) of the Criminal Code. The defence argued that there were insufficient grounds for the accused's arrest and he was therefore justified in resisting his detention. The Crown's position was that the police were justified in arresting the accused for being drunk in public. HELD: The Crown has proved beyond a reasonable doubt that the officers were engaged in the lawful execution of their duty when the accused resisted their efforts to arrest him pursuant to The Summary Offences Procedure Act. There was a complaint to police concerning the accused. He was heard and seen banging on the door of an apartment. He smelled of alcohol. He was slightly unsteady on his feet and he was yelling and swearing at the police. Given the complaint and the observations made by the attending constables, it was reasonable for them to believe that the accused was intoxicated due to the use of alcohol. He was causing a disturbance to others. Prior to his arrest, the accused began to yell at the officers in a parking lot which is, without any doubt, a public place. No one else was present who may have been capable and willing to take charge of the accused. The defence argued that in these circumstances the arresting officers should have questioned that accused as to where else he might go to sleep off his intoxication. The Crown submitted that in circumstances such as this, the police are not required to sit down and discuss with the accused where he might go. In the Court's view, s. 52(2) of The Summary Offences Procedure Act should be interpreted as meaning that there must be no other person present at the scene who is capable and willing to take care of the person who is subject to arrest. There was no such person in this case. The arrest was, on these facts, lawful.","The accused is charged with resisting arrest contrary to s. 129(a) of the Criminal Code.

HELD: The Court finds beyond a reasonable doubt that the officers were engaged in the lawful execution of their duty when the accused resisted their efforts to arrest him pursuant to the Summary Offences Procedure Act. The arrest was lawful. The Court makes the following finding of the facts: [1] The Crown has proved beyond a reasonably reasonable doubt (C.P.A.'s s. 52(2) of The Alcohol and Gaming Regulation Act, states that 'no person shall be in an intoxicated condition in a public place or permitted premises' (S. 143 of the same Act) and may arrest without warrant any person whom he finds committing an offence under the Act.

When he regained consciousness, he was lying on the floor with the defendant crouched over him. She left without saying a word and he later discovered that money was missing from his wallet, which he found under his back. The defendant was convicted of robbery when the complainant maintained that the third person in the room never left his sight and was still seated directly in front of him when he felt something being tightened around his throat. Although the third person's testimony supported the complainant's evidence, the defendant alleged that while she was in the bathroom, she heard a commotion and when she came out she saw the complainant lying on the floor and the other individual stated that she 'had the money' as she ran out the door. Not knowing what to do, she crouched over the complainant and lifted his head to see if he was okay. When he came to and said he was going to call the police, she ran because she was afraid of having her parole revoked. She appealed the conviction on the basis that the trial judge had erred in treating the conflicting Crown and defence evidence as a credibility contest. Appeal dismissed;  it was clear that the trial judge had accepted the complainant's evidence as to what had occurred along with the other witness' evidence as to who had strangled him and rejected the defendant's testimony and denials of responsibility. Although he did not specifically refer to the principles in R. v. Wry (1991) (SCC), the court was satisfied he recognized their importance and did not fall into the trap of simply comparing the Crown and defence positions without assessing the whole of the evidence. The complainant never wavered in his evidence that the other individual had never left his sight and was still seated directly in front of him when he felt something being tightened around his throat, which was supported by the other individual's testimony.","The appellant appealed her conviction for robbery alleging error by the trial judge in his assessment of credibility.

The court found no error in his conclusion that the appellant's culpability for the robbery and the assault had been established beyond reasonable doubt.[1] The appellant took the stand in her own defence. She admitted that at the time of this offence she was on parole. She knew that if she were convicted, her parole would be revoked.

The court considered Rule 37.02(c) and distinguished between the terms 'same' and 'similar' with respect to claims involving the 'same transaction' and determined the use of the term 'same' indicated it must involve the same transaction and not merely similar transactions. The court stated that there should be more than a single common question of law or question of fact except in the simplest of cases to grant a motion for consolidation. The more issues and facts in common, the more supportive those factors will be toward consolidation. The court found there was insufficient evidence of commonality between the actions and dismissed the applicants' motion for consolidation on the basis that the actions were based on similar transactions but not the same transactions. The court did not consider the applicant's request to have the matters heard sequentially because it was raised only during their reply oral submissions to the court. The court suggested that Rule 37.04, which would have allowed for common issues to be tried or heard together, would have been most applicable but was not relied upon by the applicants. The court dismissed the motion.",The plaintiffs brought a motion to consolidate their claim against the defendants with three other named actions. All four defendants were originally seeking consolidation of an action involving the same defendants and allegations of negligent management with each plaintiff during an overlapping period of time. The motion was dismissed with the exception that the matters be heard together (pursuant to Rule 37.02 of the Rules) because there was little evidence available to assess the degree of overlap in the evidence to be adduced on behalf of each plaintiff.  There was also no evidence before the Court to determine whether the proposed trials should be heard individually or in sequence.

Blood was drawn from the complainant and her infant daughter, as well as the accused pursuant to a warrant. The accused challenged the validity of the warrant.

The judge left it open to the Superintendent to proceed with his applications when the McMaster action was finished and that her decision respecting his powers was open to review upon further evidence being adduced.","The Superintendent of Pensions seeks leave to appeal an order staying six separate proceedings brought by him in purported exercise of powers conferred on him by s.8 of The Pension Benefits Act, 1992 and Regulations made thereunder.

The Municipality appealed. The Board dismissed the Director's motion holding that it did have jurisdiction. The appeal was dismissed with costs to each of the respondents in the amount of $500 plus disbursements to be paid by the appellant.

The plaintiff alleged that the equipment sold never worked properly and sought damages for breach of contract and, in the alternative, damages for fraudulent misrepresentation, damages for negligent misrepresentation, and damages for unjust enrichment in the amount of $20,000. HELD: The Court dismissed the action as the plaintiff did not establish its case on a balance of probabilities.  The Limitations Act applies and the action was barred. The defendant agreed to supply and install the equipment which was done; there was no agreement to maintain, service or reprogram equipment. There was no material misrepresentation or fraud or concealment of facts, nor unjust enrichment.","The plaintiff operates the Whitewood Inn and in September 2007, entered into an agreement with the defendant to supply and install business equipment at the Inn. The defendant alleges that the equipment sold never worked properly and seeks damages for breach of contract and in the alternative, damages for negligent misrepresentation, damage for unjust enrichment, all in the amount of $20,000. HELD: The majority of the facts are not in serious dispute. The plaintiff has always made his payments to the defendant and it has been in the exclusive possession of the Plaintiff at all material times. There is no evidence of fraud or any concealment of facts that would allow the plaintiff's claim to succeed. The Limitations Act allows an action to be commenced within 2 years of the claim being discovered. This claim was discovered prior to 2007 and therefore the Plaintiff had until October 2009 to commence his action. His action was not commenced until January 2010. There was no evidence that there was any service contract between the parties and the plaintiff was not satisfied with the equipment. The Plaintiff signed the agreement with Irwin indicating that they were satisfied with that equipment and have had two and one half years with it to inspect it or have someone else look at it to establish if anything was wrong with it. There were no service contracts entered into between the plaintiff and the defendant prior to that date. The only agreement that the parties had was to supply the equipment and install it. The court found that the defendant completed his part of the transaction and installed the equipment, and as far as he was aware, the Plaintiff was satisfied. The Court found no material representation and no fraud. The claim was statute-barred as any agreement they had was entered into prior to October 2007 and there was never any written agreement between the two parties and no service contract was ever entered between the Plaintiff and the Defendant. The defendants were negligent in failing to ensure that equipment was working for the purposes for which it was intended. The plaintiffs sued because they signed a service contract that was outside the parameters of the original agreement and were unable to reach a mutually acceptable compromise. Once a potential plaintiff has a claim against a corporation for services, it is presumed that the corporation will pay the plaintiff in accordance with the terms of that agreement. Once the plaintiff becomes aware of its existence, the claim is barred and the proceeding shall not be maintained.

d_2007skqb406.txt,"FIAT: The plaintiffs are former students of a school at Ile a La Crosse, Saskatchewan. They commenced this proposed class action against the Attorney General of Canada (the Government) in December 2005. In January 2007 the plaintiffs' counsel filed an amended statement of claim which added the Government of Saskatchewan (Saskatchewan) as a second defendant. Saskatchewan applies for an order pursuant to Rule 166 and 168 of the Queen's Bench Rules disallowing the amendments to the statement of claim. The amended claim alleges that the Government and Saskatchewan funded and were responsible for the school in a supervisory and oversight capacity and that they are liable to the plaintiffs for physical and sexual abuse, loss of language and culture, failing to provide an adequate education and holding them against their will and the will of their parents. HELD: 1) This application is based on the proposition that s. 20 of The Limitations Act applies to the plaintiffs' amended claim. However, s. 20 does not apply because no limitation period expired after the original claim was commenced and before the claim was amended to add Saskatchewan as a defendant. Section 19 of The Limitations Act applies to the original and the amended claims. The application is dismissed. 2) Accepting the pleadings as true, a number of the plaintiffs' claims are prima facie statute-barred. The plaintiff may choose to apply for orders determining that no time limitation period applies or allowing the claims to be brought. Alternatively, the defendants may apply for orders determining that some or all of the claims are statute-barred. In either case, the applications must satisfy the applicable legislation and the Rules of Court.",HELD: The application was dismissed. The court held that a number of the plaintiffs’ claims were prima facie statute-barred. They argued that s. 20 of The Limitations Act applied because no limitation period expired after the original claim was commenced and before the claim was amended to add Saskatchewan as a defendant. Saskatchewan’s application for an order disallowing the amendments was not supported by the pleadings or by relevant evidence. A number of issues were raised in argument but not placed before the Court in form and substance that could fairly be considered and decided. The pleadings indicated that the plaintiffs were alive to the possibility of some of their claims being statute barred. They asked the court to extend the time for commencing the action on a nunc pro tunc basis.
6_2013skca2.txt,"The Crown applied for leave to appeal a Queen's Bench decision that set aside the convictions of the respondents, Chisum Log Homes and Lumber Ltd. and its sole director, Varga, for operating a forest products processing facility without a licence, contrary to s. 18.1 of The Forest Resources Management Act. The charges had stemmed from the manufacture of log-home packages by the company under the direction of Varga. The manufacture of these packages entailed the purchase of felled trees harvested by others from Crown lands. The logs were then cut at the respondents' facility into various lengths and notched, marked for construction and assembled into log-home packages. In the appeal to Queen's Bench of the convictions, the judge found that these steps in the manufacture of the packages did not engage the licencing provisions of the Act. HELD: The Court gave leave to appeal and allowed the appeal. Based on the definitions provided in s. 2 of the Act with respect to the words 'processing facility', 'forest products', and 'manufacture', it found that the operation of the facility by the company and Varga without a processing facility licence was unlawful as being contrary to s. 18.1. As the Provincial Court judge's conclusion was correct, the Court held that the convictions must stand and did not interfere with the fines and surcharges imposed upon the respondents.","The petitioner manufactures log-home packages near Weyakwin, under the direction of Garry Varga, the sole director of the company. As a result of what the manufacture of these packages entails, both the company and Varga were convicted in Provincial Court of operating a forest products processing facility without a licence, contrary to s.18.1 of The Forest Resources Management Act, S.S. 1996. In consequence, each was fined and ordered to pay a surcharge. The Attorney General applied to the Court of Queen's Bench for leave to appeal on the grounds the judge misconstrued the licensing provisions of the Act and hence misapplied them. HELD: Appeal allowed. The convictions must stand. The matter need not have been taken up in the context of this case, at least not in the extent and to the effect the judge thought appropriate. The fines and surcharges are nothing in the case to suggest we might interfere with the decision of the trial judge, so they must stand too."
c_2013skca113.txt,"HELD: The applicant’s first two grounds of appeal related to the evidence of the respondents’ and police. The Court of Appeal was not persuaded that questions of evidence were of sufficient importance to grant leave. The applicant’s third ground was that the Chambers judge failed to take into account the interests of the public, particularly, the need to deter the public and the need to remove profit from crime to compensate victims. The Court of Appeal did not grant leave on the third ground. The Chambers judge reviewed the relevant case law and did not fail to take those items into account. The last ground of appeal was the fact that the vehicle had already been held for 90 days. The Court of Appeal said that this ground did raise some interest but they were not convinced that this was the case to grant the leave to appeal.","The Director of the Director's application for the forfeiture of a vehicle registered to the respondent was brought pursuant to s. of the Act on the ground that the vehicle had been used in criminal activity. The vehicle in question is a 2010 Ford Transit Cargo Van. The Director purchased it in 2010 with money received from her father's estate. Beginning in January of 2013, she and the respondent used it to haul items on an on-call basis. In March of 2012, the accused entered the compound through a hole in the fence and returned to the Vehicle with two pails full of copper wire. As a witness approached the scene, witnesses called out warning to the accused. The accused and the vehicle's owner, the respondent, were in the vehicle for approximately nine months. When the driver threatened to call the police, the parties hid the vehicle in a nearby fenced compound and entered the vehicle with two large pails of copper wired. As the accused and driver argued that they were forced to forfeit their vehicle and livelihood as a consequence of three ineptly carried out efforts to steal copper material, the Chambers judge dismissed the application. He noted that, in all the circumstances of this case, questions of evidence are of sufficient importance to engage the Court. He conducted a relatively thorough review of the case law in the course of establishing the framework governing his decision-making process. He was also at pains to underline the exceptional nature of his power to deny a forfeiture application. HELD: The appeal was dismissed.  1) With respect to issues (a) and (b) of the proposed appeal, not at all sure that the judge overlooked the interests of the public or failed to consider the need to deter crime, undercut the profitability of crime, and so forth. His characterization of the accused's evidence as having been made on information and belief did not serve to give primacy to these interests and, in particular, failing to consider that the accused had been sentenced to 12 months of probation and 80 hours of community service and taking into account the fact they had been held by the Director for 90 days.  2) The test for granting leave to appeal is well known. It involves a consideration of both the merits and the importance of an appeal. The Court is not persuaded that the Court's characterization is appropriate in this case.  3) The Director's s. 3(1) decision was not of particular importance to the Court given the nature of the appeal"

In June 1995 he began to experience pain in his back which slowly worsened until he was hospitalized in October 1995. He was diagnosed with a large central and right sided disc herniation. SGI denied his claim for income replacement benefits as a non-earner under s.117(1) of the Automobile Accident Insurance Act. In issue was whether the accident caused the disc herniation. HELD: The appeal was dismissed. The plaintiff had not met the onus on him of establishing causation on a balance of probabilities. Two family physicians supported his contention but the medical director of rehabilitation services for SGI and the orthopaedic surgeon who treated the applicant were both of the opinion the herniation was not caused by the accident.,"An application under Part VIII of the Automobile Accident Insurance Act for income replacement benefits contending that the accident caused the disc herniation. The respondent, Saskatchewan Government Insurance, denied the claim. The applicant applied to the respondent for review of its decision and appealed to the Court pursuant to s. 197. HELD: The application was dismissed. There was no doubt that for a period of time after the disc hersiation, the non-earner was unable to hold the employment he could have held at the time of the accident and would be entitled to an income replacement benefit. The onus is on the applicant to establish his claim to the benefits on a balance of probabilities. His appeal is dismissed."
d_2017skpc77.txt,"HELD: The accused was not guilty of either charge. Although the accused was lawfully stopped, the roadside demand was valid and the accused declined to exercise his right to counsel on two occasions following his arrest, the observation period at the detachment was not conducted properly. The officer was sometimes focused on other things. As the observation period comprised part and parcel of a breath test, the breathalyzer test was not properly administered and the Crown could not rely on the accuracy of the readings.","The accused was charged with impaired driving and operating a motor vehicle while over.08 contrary to s. 255(1) and s. 253(1)(a) of the Criminal Code and having consumed alcohol in such a quantity that his blood alcohol concentration exceeded 80 milligrams of alcohol in 100 millilitres of blood while awaiting a sample of the ASD test. HELD: The accused was found not guilty of count 2, over.08. The evidence does not support a finding of guilt on count 1. The observation period was not conducted properly. The police officer did not observe the accused put anything in his mouth; he never heard the accused burp or belch; and he was in close proximity to the accused. The breathalyzer instrument did not detect any mouth alcohol. The accused did not attempt to call counsel at the roadside. The officer's notes do not provide any other reasons for the stop. The Court of Queen's Bench decision in By does not stand for the proposition that an accused's s. 10(b) Charter rights must be implemented at roadside during the screening techniques in every instance. There is sufficient factual similarity between By and this case that it cannot be distinguished on the facts. In both cases the police officer was attending to other tasks and not focussed on the accused and his right to counsel was breached. The Police Officer was actually absent for a period of time from the accused's presence."
b_1997canlii11437.txt,"A month following the birth of the plaintiff's only child by caesarian section, she underwent a hysterectomy on an emergency basis. She believed that the post-partum haemorrhage was caused by retained products of conception and that failure to perform a dilation and curettage procedure resulted in the hysterectomy. HELD: The plaintiff's claim was dismissed with costs. 1)The plaintiff failed to prove that the defendant was negligent in his treatment of her. The doctor's treatment and care met the standard of care expected of the average physician and surgeon, specializing in gynaecology and obstetrics. 2)She failed to prove that the cause of the post-partum haemorrhage was retained products of conception or that his failure to perform a D&amp;C resulted in the necessity of a hysterectomy or because of any other negligent act or omission on his part. The most likely hypothesis was that the post-partum hemorrhage was caused in this case by the necrosis of the cervix. Given the rarity of this condition and paucity of documented medical knowledge the defendant doctor could not be faulted. The evidence did not support the suggestion that a D&amp;C would have cured the hemorrhage. ADDENDUM: 1)The first paragraph was deleted and a new paragraph substituted: Kaban v. Sett in applying Ares v. Venner rejected the view that nurse's notes are only prima facie evidence and, if there is sworn testimony contrary to the notes, the notes cease to be prima facie evidence. 2)A paragraph was added after the quote on page 4: The Manitoba Court of Appeal, in dismissing the plaintiff's appeal, agreed with the trial judge's determination of the admissibility of the nurse's notes.","The plaintiff gave birth to a healthy baby girl on August 25, 1992. She was admitted to the Victoria Union Hospital on an emergency basis as a result of the sudden onset of profuse vaginalbleeding. The defendant performed a caesarian section to contain the bleeding and stabilized the plaintiff. The plaintiff alleged that the hysterectomy was negligent in the performance of his professional duties and services upon her with the result that the hemorrhage became inevitable. Central to the plaintiff's allegations of negligence on the part of the defendant was that the likely cause of the ongoing or recurring bleeding was the retained products of conception which the surgeon failed to remove from her uterus by a dilation and curettage procedure.HELD: The plaintiff was awarded damages for irretrievable loss and for the pain and suffering resulting from her treatment and surgery.  1)The Court found that the surgical procedures performed on the plaintiff were realistic and reasonable in that they prevented the bleeding which in turn would have obviated the necessity of performing the hysticomy. 2)The surgical procedures were straightforward and methodical. The only thing that could be expected of a surgical procedure was a detailed description of the procedures performed. 3)No medical evidence was given as a prima facie proof of the facts stated in Ares v. Venner, which held that if a doctor faced with a post-partum hemorrhage problem would, given that the most common cause of such a hemorrhage is retained products, then his diagnosis and treatment should be proper and reasonable."
d_2002skpc138.txt,"The accused was charged with failure to comply with a demand to provide a breath sample contrary to s.254(5) of the Criminal Code. He argued that he had a reasonable excuse to refuse based on his medical condition of anxiety attacks at the time of blowing. HELD: 1)This case is similar to the Alberta Court of Appeal decision in Topp which stated the accused must not conceal his reasons for refusing to give breath samples. The case has to be decided on the basis of what the police knew or could readily surmise, not on the hidden facts, which the accused had not disclosed. The New Brunswick case of R. v. Dunnett canvassed the law with respect to s.10(b) rights and cited four factors arising from recent SCC decisions concerning detained or arrested person's right to a lawyer. Granted the accused was charged with refusal 51 minutes after the demand for the breath tests, even though he was diligent in attempting to reach counsel, he was not diligent in pursuing his rights after he unsuccessfully tried to contact a lawyer three times. It is not a police officer's obligation to go further if the accused does not appreciate the advice of Legal Aid counsel. 2)His evidence was not believed as to the anxiety attacks. The intoxilyzer did not register because he was not breathing properly into the mouthpiece. He provided an adequate supply of air in the roadside screening device about an hour prior. The statement of law enunciated in Pederson out of the Yukon Territory Supreme Court was adopted. It could not be concluded on the evidence that his respiratory problems made it impossible to provide a sample. The doctor stated he could do so when his breathing returned to normal as did the accused. Further an accused who is aware of what triggers his anxiety attacks, for example a hard night of drinking the night before, and continues to drink alcohol and operate a motor vehicle cannot be later heard to say and hope to avoid conviction that the refusal was a result of a known medical condition. He should not drink and drive.","The accused, a 28 year member of the RCMP, failed to comply with a demand made to him by a Peace Officer pursuant to s. 254(3) of the Criminal Code requiring him to provide then or a soon thereafter as is practicable such samples of his breath as in the opinion of a qualified technician are necessary to enable a proper analysis to be made in order to determine the concentration, if any, of alcohol in his blood. HELD: The accused was convicted of failure to provide a sample. The Court found that the accused was not diligent in attempting to obtain counsel as he was not aware of what triggers his anxiety attacks and that his breathing was erratic. The accused did not communicate the contents of the message on the answering machine to the police officer thus not allowing the officer to consider a longer waiting period than the 10 minutes he did allow."
b_1996canlii6726.txt,"FIAT. The plaintiffs sought an order preserving and detaining certain proceeds from oil production properties which were being held by an escrow agent pursuant to an order of the bankruptcy court in Alberta and a further order preserving and detaining all future proceeds from those properties. The applicants claimed such orders were necessary to protect their claims under the approximately 408 builders' liens filed against those oil properties. The contents of the statements of claim in each of the five actions were identical. HELD: The application was dismissed. The escrow agent was ordered to remit to Herc the lien property revenues with any interest earned less the agent's appropriate costs. With the exception of SEM the parties appearing through counsel were awarded their costs against the applicants. 1)The tests set out in Bean on Injunctions for granting a mandatory injunction were summarized in Cupar School Division. The tests really state in different forms the generally recognized test for prima facie case, irreparable harm and balance of convenience but with more stringent requirements. 2)Only one lien holder filed an affidavit, no invoices or other information were filed substantiating the amount claimed in any of the liens. The word 'or' used in one of the liens indicated that the person subject to the lien did not know whether the water or oil was transported. Whatever prima facie case the lien holders might have was weakened. 3)The applicants had not established a very strong probability that grave danger will accrue. The risk to the respondents if the order should be granted was far greater than the risk to the applicants if the order were not granted. The oil properties would continue to decline without further development or recovery efforts to maintain or increase production. If a preservation order issued SEM would likely exercise its extensive powers under the Oil and Gas Conservation Act. 4)While s33 of the Builders' Lien Act provides for a lien on the holdback of any trust funds held by the contractor, it does not give the lienholder a charge against any other moneys. A builder's lien cannot be looked on as 'proof' that the amount claimed is what is actually owing. The only remedy open to the lienholder is to enforce its claim under Part VIII of the Builders' Lien Act. The statement of claim said nothing about dates and times. On the material filed it was impossible to know whether any of the respondents were intervening parties within s49(5)(a). 5)The second and third tests were not met. The order would guarantee irreparable harm by freezing the capital necessary to hinder the decline in value. It would be unacceptable to SEM that lien holders should receive the income from the properties without being responsible for the environmental costs. 6)The fourth test required that the defendant know exactly what he has to do. If the order were to issue it would be difficult to determine the proper amount of lien property revenue that should be paid to an escrow agent. There was no definition of net revenues in the Plan. The applicants would have been required pursuant to Rule 390 to pay full compensation before the order was issued.","FIAT The plaintiffs sought an order preserving and detaining certain proceeds from certain oil production properties, those proceeds now being held by an escrow agent pursuant to an order of the bankruptcy court in Alberta, and a further order preservingand detaining all future production proceeds from those properties. The defendants filed affidavits in support of the application. They argued that they would suffer irreparable harm if the order was not granted because the proceeds would cease to exist and the properties would become worthless. They sought to attach the words 'all outstanding debts, claims or damages' to the builders' liens. HELD: The application was dismissed. The court held that although the applicants had not met the first test, they had shown a strong probability that grave damage would accrue to the plaintiffs' property and that there was a distinct possibility that the preservation order issue would force the defendant to take appropriate steps to recover the funds necessary to maintain the properties.  1)The applicants failed to meet the second test which must be met in order for a mandatory injunction to be granted. 2)The court must be careful to see that the defendant knows exactly what he has to do and this test goes much further than the 'prima facie', or strong prima facie, case that must be proven in negative injunction application. 3)The Court was not able to say that the applicants' application was sufficient to satisfy the test set out in Cupar, but it was possible to speculate that they might be joined by other lienholders who had not joined the applicants in the actions. 4)The plaintiff did not meet the third test, which was whether the applicants would be required to pay full compensation before the order sought was issued. The Court was of the view that it did not have the means to do so."
7_2016skpc104.txt,"Criminal Law – Evidence – CredibilityCriminal Law – Evidence – Expert Evidence – Blood Alcohol ConcentrationCriminal Law – Impaired Driving – Blood Alcohol Level Exceeding .08 The accused was charged with three Criminal Code offences: driving while impaired, contrary to s. 253(1)(a); driving over .08, contrary to s. 153(1)(b); and with failing to stop for a police officer as soon as reasonable in order to evade that officer, contrary to s. 249.1(2)). As he was completing a traffic stop, an officer heard the accused’s truck in the early morning hours. When the officer engaged his police vehicle emergency lights, the accused spun his tires, fish-tailed, and took off. The accused failed to stop at two stop signs and eventually stopped in the driveway of his house. The accused was arrested for the s. 249.1 offence and was given a breath demand after he failed as ASD. He failed the ASD between 3:01 and 3:03 and the breath samples were taken at 3:55 and 4:17. The accused admitted that he was drinking alcohol that evening, but denied being impaired. He said he was not trying to evade the officer when he failed to stop for him. He also said that alcohol he had just had was not in his system yet when he was driving, but was at the time of the breath samples. The officer indicated that the accused had glossy, watery eyes, but his walk and speech were fairly normal. The officer smelled alcohol coming from the accused, but was surprised he did not show more impairment given his driving. The accused indicated that he had consumed six beer that day, but the officer noted more than six empty beer cans on the accused’s table when he was getting his shoes. The accused indicated that he downed six or seven ounces of vodka just before driving at 2:45. An alcohol expert and the accused testified. The defence expert testified that the accused’s blood alcohol concentration (BAC) at the time of driving would not have been over .08 based on the drinking the accused testified to. The issues were: 1) whether there was proof beyond a reasonable doubt that the accused’s ability to drive was impaired by alcohol; 2) whether the accused’s evidence raised a reasonable doubt that his blood alcohol concentration was over the legal limit at the time when he finally stopped his vehicle; and 3) whether the accused had reasonable excuse for not stopping immediately for the officer and whether his actions amounted to him evading the police officer. The accused had nine drinking and driving convictions since 1982 with the most recent in 2007. HELD: The issues were determined as follows: 1) the Crown did not prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the accused’s ability to drive was impaired; 2) section 258(1)(d.1) deals with the last drink defence. The court had to be satisfied that the accused’s drinking was consistent with his BAC being not over .08 at the time of driving yet being consistent with the BAC’s in the Certificate of Analysis. The court preferred the officer’s evidence over the accused’s, given the drinking affected his recollections. The court was not satisfied that the defence provided a credible account of the accused’s alcohol consumption. Given the findings, the court was unable to apply the expert’s opinions. The court did not have a reasonable doubt regarding the accused’s guilt on the driving while over .08 charge; and 3) there was no doubt that the accused knew he was being pursued by the police and did not stop as soon as was reasonable in the circumstances. The court concluded that the accused did not have a reasonable excuse for not stopping. There was also no doubt that the accused attempted to get away from the officer because he was afraid of the legal consequences that he could face. The accused was found guilty of the evading charge.","The accused was charged with impaired driving and driving while his ability to do so was impaired (under s. 253(1)(a)) and while his blood alcohol concentration exceeded the legal limit of.08. The accused offered a 'last drink' defence, that alcohol he drank just before driving was not yet in his blood stream when he was stopped by the officer, but was at the time his breath tests were taken at the detachment. HELD: The accused was found not guilty on the impaired driving charge and on the over.08 charge. The court accepted the accused's evidence that he was not trying to evade the police officer and accepted the evidence of Cst. Cobbledick. The Court was not satisfied that the accused attempted to get away from the officer when he turned on his emergency lights, because he was afraid of the legal consequences that could befall him at that point. The evidence of the last drink was different in terms of both the amount of beer and hard liquor consumed and the time the hard liquor was consumed than the one given to the accused. The defence called alcohol expert Mary Ellen Scott and claimed the accused was drinking alcohol steadily over the hours before driving and that this factor, taken together with the time since this day, effected his recollection of what he drank that day and night."
2_2011nssc500.txt,"The accused was charged with trafficking in cocaine and possession of cocaine for the purposes of trafficking. He was arrested within minutes of two officers observing what they believed to be a drug transaction. After watching the accused roam the street, they had observed him meet up and speak briefly with another person, whom he motioned to follow him and they proceeded by different routes, meeting up at the rear corner of a building. Although the area was dimly lit, one of the officers saw the accused remove something from a small pink plastic bag, which he then placed in the other person's hand. The encounter was very brief and neither officer observed any money exchanged. A ball of crack cocaine was later seized from the other person's jacket pocket. Although no drugs were found on the accused, a search of the area located a pink baggy of drugs stashed in a rock wall close to ground level. The defence argued that the drugs seized from the other person could have come from anywhere and constructive possession had not been proven with respect to the baggy located in the wall. Accused found guilty on both counts; the court accepted that the drugs found in the wall belonged to him and his possession was constructive, done knowingly for his use and benefit so he could return to the stash for his next transaction. The encounter described was consistent with low level street trafficking (brief and direct contact between buyer and seller, the passing communication and gesture to go to another place to avoid police scrutiny and the frequent disposal of the remaining drugs by stashing) and inconsistent with any other possible explanation. Moments after handing something to the other person, the accused's silhouette was observed in the area where the drugs were stashed and the court was satisfied that he had placed the drugs in the wall minutes before his arrest.",The accused was charged with two counts under the Controlled Drugs and Substances Act and one count of possession of cocaine for the purposes of trafficking. The police observed the transaction from an observation post less than 130 feet from the incident and from a position of some elevation. Constable Marriott had the use of expensive binoculars to view the encounter. The accused denied having stashed the drugs in the rock wall. HELD: The Court found the accused guilty of both counts. The Court was satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt that the accused stashed these drugs in a rock wall after the transaction and that he did so minutes before his arrest. The evidence respecting the cutting substances in crack cocaine constituted enough cocaine to supply the accused with his next transaction. It was also concluded that the gesturing to another place for the deal to take place was common practice in street level drug trafficking.
5_2013skqb237.txt,"The accused was charged with one count of impaired driving and one count of operating a motor vehicle while his blood alcohol content exceeded .08, contrary to ss. 253(1)(a) and 253(1)(b) of the Criminal Code. After trial, the accused was found not guilty on both charges. The Crown appealed on the basis that the trial judge erred in law in finding that the accused's rights were violated pursuant to s. 10(b) of the Charter and by excluding the evidence pursuant to s. 24(2) of the Charter. The accused was stopped by RCMP at 2:47 am to check his licence, registration, and sobriety. There were no driving irregularities leading to the stop. The officer noted a slight smell of alcohol and the accused blew a 'fail' on the roadside screening device. The accused indicated at roadside that he would like to contact a lawyer. At the detachment, the accused was asked which lawyer he wanted to contact and the accused gave a name to which the officer misunderstood. A search for the misunderstood name by the officer did not result in any findings. A search for a second name given by the accused resulted in 60 persons and the officer did not pursue any of them. The officer suggested legal aid but the accused refused. The accused was never provided a phone or a phonebook. The accused subsequently indicated that he understood the waiver regarding legal counsel and that he did not want to contact one. The accused did not recall this waiver. The accused indicated that he provided breath samples right away because he thought the officer was in a hurry and he understood that if he did not provide breath samples he was automatically guilty. The accused's readings were .11 and .04. The trial judge held that the accused was not given a reasonable opportunity to exercise his right to counsel of his choice and that the appropriate remedy was to exclude the breath sample results. HELD: The appeal was not successful. Whether there has been a Charter breach and whether evidence should thus be excluded are both questions of law reviewable on a standard of correctness. There is both an informational component and an implementational component to s. 10(b). The implementational component was the one of concern because the accused was not provided with the opportunity to consult counsel of his choice. The appeal court had to determine who was responsible for that failure. The failure was that of the officer first in misunderstanding the lawyer's name, then in not asking the accused the name again, and then in abandoning the search of the second lawyer when too many names were returned. The waiver did not remedy the situation because the accused did not fully understand it and it was therefore not effective. The trial judge did not err in finding that the accused`s s. 10(b) rights were breached. The trial judge correctly applied the test for s. 24(2) and the finding that the admission of the breath samples would bring the administration of justice into disrepute was not set aside.","The accused was charged with impaired driving contrary to s. 253(1)(a) the Criminal Code and with operating a motor vehicle while impaired by alcohol contrary to ss. 253 (1)(b) of the Code. The Crown did not pursue the first count but did launch an appeal as to the second count. HELD: The appeal was dismissed. 1) The trial judge addressed the factors and correctly applied the test. As there was no error, the trial judge was not prepared to set aside his decision. 2) On the first stage the accused was provided an opportunity to be informed of his rights and obligations under the law and, most importantly, to obtain advice on how to exercise those rights and fulfil those obligations. 3) The officer did not turn to the accused in an attempt to reduce the number of names. There really was no similarity between the name 'Vaughn' and the one that was noticed in the name of a relative who was known to him. There was no other observable sign of impairment. It was most likely that some physical impediment caused the accused to make mistake. 4) When the computer search was negative, the matter was abandoned and a computer search of that name was unsuccessful. The accused stated that he had consumed four or five drinks. He was alert, quiet and polite. His speech was not slurred. 5) It is not an issue that the accused invoked his right to counsel. The first stage of the investigation was to check the driver's licence, the vehicle registration and sobriety. The second stage was to exclude the results of the analysis of breath samples. The court took comfort in the fact that, on balance, it was not the officer's attitude that constituted indifference to the Charter test that constituted a breach of his or her Charter rights."
9_2009skqb313.txt,"The appellant appeals a demolition order pursuant to s. 329(4) of The Cities Act issued against his property. Issues on appeal was whether the board erred by considering material which had not been before city council, whether the board committed a jurisdictional error by failing to disclose evidence to the appellant prior to considering the appeal, and whether the board was biased against the appellant. HELD: The appeal is dismissed on all grounds. The board's order is confirmed. Counsel for the City advised that it would be appropriate to extend the suspension of enforcement of the demolition order to a period of 6 months from the date of this court order. The applicant is granted a 6 month period to remedy the problems identified. 1) The board complied with the directions of the Saskatchewan Court of Appeal to ensure all disclosure had been made to the appellant of relevant evidence that would be considered by the board. The board has ensured that the appellant knew the case he had to meet. No error of law has been committed. 2) The appellant had all the information considered by the board disclosed to him. 3) There is no evidence of bias. Oppositely, the evidence supports the board's conclusion that the situation in the building constituted a nuisance related to the activities around the building, including the safety of the residents and surrounding neighbours. There is no evidence of bias against the appellant personally.","The registered owner of the property applies for an order of vacate and demolish to allow him to remedy his problems with the building. The building inspector at the time of issuing the demolition order had not received complete disclosure of the case he had to meet as the earlier complaints had not led to the order. The inspector now seeks leave from the Court to launch an appeal to the Court of Queen's Bench pursuant to s. 329(4) of The Cities Act. The board has complied with the direction of the Saskatchewan Court of Appeal to ensure all disclosure has been made to the applicant regarding relevant evidence that would be considered by the board. HELD: The appeal is dismissed. 1) The board's order is confirmed. It is not appropriate to restrict either party in putting forward evidence which they consider relevant on these questions. 2) There is no error of law. The Board acted in a reasonable and prudent manner in confirming the November 2004 demolition order. 3) It would be appropriate to have the applicant apply to the court for a period of time to bring forth his written proposal as outlined in the board's decision. In this sense, the board has ensured that the applicant knew the case they had to attend to and that it was able to remedy the underlying problems by permitting the applicant to bring forward his proposal."
b_2017skqb81.txt,"HELD: The issues were determined as follows: 1) the applicant applied pursuant to The Seizure of Criminal Property Act, 2009, as that version of the Act was in place at the time of the seizure. The respondent argued that s. 35.1 did not apply at the time of seizure, because it was not in the Act at the time of seizure. The respondent argued that the two-year limitation period pursuant to The Limitations Act applied to the application with the date of seizure being the date of discoverability. The respondent also argued that the 2009 Act did not have retrospective application. The court found that the applicant applied pursuant to the 2009 Act and therefore the matter was assessed from that perspective. Section 35.1 of the 2009 Act required applications for forfeiture to be made within two years from the director becoming satisfied that the property sought to be forfeited was proceeds of unlawful activity or an instrument of unlawful activity. The court found that the words “Notwithstanding The Limitations Act” at the beginning of s. 35.1 served to provide an intention to prioritize the content of s. 35.1 over The Limitations Act. An affidavit filed by the applicant indicated that the director became satisfied that the property was an instrument of unlawful activity after August 2016. The director’s application was brought four months later, well within the two-year limitation period. The court then considered whether the 2009 Act had retrospective application and found that B. had the same legal position and faced the same jeopardy regardless of the version of the legislation, and therefore, there was no retrospective problem;  2) s. 7 outlined the test to apply. The court accepted the expert’s evidence with regards to the significance of the factors evidencing drug trafficking and how common they were to the drug trafficking trade. The applicant’s evidence also showed that the person alleging to purchase the truck from the respondent was not the purchaser and the purchase price was $8,000, not $16,000. The court found it more likely than not that the money was proceeds of unlawful activity; and 3) B. did not provide evidence or argument to support the exception that forfeiture would clearly not be in the interests of justice. The property was found to be proceeds of unlawful activity and the forfeiture order was granted.","The Director applied for an order directing the forfeiture of $10,475.00 of property to the Crown in Saskatchewan. The property had been seized by the Regina Police Service from William Ross Butler in 2008. Since the plaintiff filed notice of dispute in response to those proceedings, the Director applied to this Court for a forfeiture order pursuant to Part II.1 of the 2009 Act. HELD: The application was granted. The Director’s evidence consisted of three affidavits filed by the respondents. The majority (93%) of cash seized was in $20 denominations and the evidence of the respondent was based on the expiration of a limitation period. The remainder of cash was in denominations of $1,000 to $2,500. The respondents’ affidavits were based on information provided by the respondent that the respondent had purchased a truck from him in 2007. The respondent claimed the vehicle was never registered in any of the names of the individuals present at the time of the search. At para of his affidavit, he said: 8. THAT Mr. Metz had been paying the respondent back for the money that lent him the truck and do not know why Mr. Calfas would suggest that the vehicles were never registered IN any of our names. 9. That the respondent swore an affidavit in support of the Director.  10. That he was aware of the property when it was seized from Butler and the fact that the property was in such good standing with the Saskatchewan Police Service and that he lent the money to the respondent for the purchase of the truck was not in any way inconsistent with that of the individual charged with the criminal offence as opposed to the property derived from unlawful activity.  11. That there was no retroactivity issue to be tried in this Court because the statute was enacted prior to the coming into force and the legislation was not made expressly retroactive."
3_2004skqb374.txt,"FIAT: In 1996, the respondent was ordered to pay $600 per month as child support for his daughter. He now applies to reduce his support obligation and rescind the arrears which have accumulated. HELD: 1) In 1999, the respondent sold his ownership interest in a business and retained a one-third interest. In 2001, he was terminated from his full-time employment as a result of an unexplained absence from work after he received a suspension for insubordination. Since his termination, he has not obtained full-time employment. He has continued to work seasonally 3 months a year and earn the gross amount of $21,000. The Court found that it is the respondent's choice to work a minimum amount each year. It has been said that individuals, who are subject to support obligations, are entitled to make decisions in relation to their careers as long as the decisions are reasonable at the time having regard to the circumstances. The respondent's decision to work only three months a year and to possibly return to school is not reasonable. 2) For the purposes of this application, the respondent's income was imputed to be $40,000 and he was ordered to pay $328 per month as support for his daughter. 3) The sharing of the s. 7 special expenses should be based on the respondent's imputed income. 4) A retroactive variation of child support is warranted. The respondent commenced his application for variation in June 2002 and the chambers judge was of the view that any variation of support should be retroactive to September 2002.  In light of the fact the respondent's previous support obligation was tax deductible/tax inclusive, the petitioner may in fact benefit from a retroactive variation as the child support she will receive, pursuant to this order, will be payable on a net of tax basis.  5) Rule 608(2) provides that a successful party will be entitled to costs of a family law proceeding unless, pursuant to Rule 608(3), the successful party has behaved unreasonably or has acted in bad faith. The difficulty in the matter before me is determining whether or not the respondent has been successful. Although his support obligation decreases, his previous payment was tax deductible while his ongoing payment will be net of tax. It is very likely that the respondent's financial position has not changed as a result of the order. The Court also had grave concerns respecting the substantial delays in the proceedings caused by the respondent's unwillingness to provide financial disclosure. Costs were awarded to the petitioner in the sum of $750, as the discovery motion would not have been necessary had the respondent provided appropriate financial disclosure.","FIAT. The father of one child applied to reduce his child support obligation and rescind arrears which had accumulated under an order of Archambault J. dated March 6, 1996. In his last full year with Ipsco, being the 2000 taxation year, the father's gross annual income was the sum of $52,377. HELD: 1) The father's choice to work a minimum amount each year and, if he should return to school, it will be his choice to attend school and severely limit his earnings for a significant period of time. It has been said in number of cases that individuals who are subject to support obligations are entitled to make decisions in relation to their careers as long as the decisions are reasonable at the time having regard to all the circumstances. The court has grave concerns respecting the substantial delays in this proceeding. 2) On all of the evidence the father has indicated that he is underemployed, must determine the amount of income to be imputed to the respondent. The primary question is, what are the appropriate s. Guideline expenses for the child and how should these expenses be shared by the father and Ms. Lilley?  3) The mother has requested costs as against the father for the additional legal expenses associated with having to submit motions to the Court in order to force the father to disclose financial information.  4) Costs are awarded to the mother in the amount amount of $750. The mother's application for further disclosure was before the Court on September 10, 2003 and made an order allowing her to cross-examine the father on the affidavits and financial statements."

At issue was whether s5.3 of the Trade Union Act authorized the Board to make such an order. HELD: The appeal was dismissed with costs.  1)The Board recognized the question to be a jurisdictional question. The standard of review is whether the decision was correct rather than patently unreasonable. 2)The chambers judge arrived at the correct conclusion whether from the point of view of the plain meaning of the words of s5.3 or the context of the entire statute or a purposive approach.  3)S5.3 refers to the 'board' which is defined by s2(c) to be the LRB and accordingly referred to applications and orders of the LRB. The interim power is not only based on the final power but is also part of the final power and both are part of the same process. 4)S25(1), when read with ss(1.1) and (1.2) indicates an intention on the part of the legislators to grant exclusive jurisdiction to arbitration boards to deal with disputes arising out of the interpretation of collective agreements. 5)Whatever the scope of s42, it cannot be used to release the restrictions of a statutory provision the very purpose of which is to define the jurisdiction of the LRB to act in respect of such matters.","This was an appeal from an order of Barclay J. which quashed an interim order of the Labour Relations Board pending the determination of a grievance by an arbitration board, even though no proceedings were pending before the labour Relations Board, and even though it had no power to make any final order respecting the proceedings before the arbitration board. HELD: The appeal was dismissed with costs in the usual way. 1)Section 5.3 both confers and limits the jurisdiction of the Board to make interim orders. The question decided by the Board, that it had power to makes the order in question, was clearly a jurisdictional question and so treated it. Accordingly the standard of review is whether the decision was correct, rather than whether it was patently unreasonable. The chambers judge arrived at a correct conclusion. The ordinary meaning of the words of s.5.3 require two conditions for the exercise of the power: the existence of an application or complaint before the board, andthe existence of power in the labour board to make final order in respect of the application. 2)S.25(1) indicates an intention on the part of the legislators to grant exclusive jurisdiction to arbitration boards to deal with disputes arising out of the interpretation of collective agreements. Nor is there anything in s.25 or the other sections of the Act dealing with resolution of disputes by arbitration to indicate an intention to grant supervisory or other powers to the the board in the conduct of the arbitration process."

In earlier hearings, the Crown and applicant had each sought new trial dates to ensure procurement of witnesses for trial. The Crown sought to subpoena the victim to testify.

The victim did not learn of the trial date until the day before and was unable to attend. An adjournment was granted. The applicant contended the trial judge had exceeded his jurisdiction. Dismissing the application. It is within the jurisdiction of the trial judge to deal with the issue of adjournments in accordance with the provisions of the Criminal Code. Jurisdictional error is not to be equated with error of law. Any decision to grant an adjournment is therefore within the court's proper discretion. If a remedy exists, it is by way of an appeal and not a prerogative writ. In any event, the sequence of events was sufficient to justify the granting of an adjournment. There was neither neglect nor laches on the part of the Crown.","The applicant sought an order of prohibition and certiorari directing that judge Archibald and any other provincial court judge could not hear the trial of the accused in Queen v. Jessome. The Defence had attempted to co-operate with the Crown in setting dates and co-operated to the extent that they apparently fumbled on one of the subpoenas. The judge granted the adjournment. The applicant, who had been tried in Provincial Court but plead not guilty, applied to have the order of the judge struck because it was in the nature of an adjournment order and he had not been privy to the information which had been provided to him by counsel.

The husband had declared personal bankruptcy since the date of the original orders obtained under the Matrimonial Property Act and Divorce Act. HELD: 1)The husband's obligation to pay maintenance was reduced to $1 per month and the arrears accruing after the date of his assignment into bankruptcy were cancelled.  2)The wife's counsel requested that the court value and divide all of the matrimonial property equally notwithstanding the bankruptcy, because she might pursue a constructive trust claim for her 1/2 share as against the husband's trustee. 3)The court valued all of the matrimonial property and determined that 56% of this value should be paid to the wife, and only 44% to the husband, given amounts he had spent since the separation.  4)The court left unresolved the issue of which matrimonial assets might be exempt under the Bankruptcy Act and therefore available to the wife.","In November 1993 following a trial involving the divorce of the parties, including corollary relief on such questions as spousal maintenance and division of matrimonial property, a division of the property was held. At issue was whether the husband should resume livestock operation on the farm and whether it was a viable operation. HELD: 1)The wife was entitled to the following set-off: $800 for February and $1,100 for March, April and May for a total of $4,100.  2)The respondent's claim for set-offs was allowed since he did not take up farming and his subsequent decision to assign into bankruptcy a substantial amount of the farm assets were still to be dealt with. 3)The petitioner paid $2,300 by way of maintenance out of the proceeds of certain barley sold privately. The respondent claimed this was in violation of the previous order prohibiting the sale of any assets without consent of the other party or the Court. 4)Division of property was based on asset values at this stage problematical and indeed by including some assets which may not be exempt in whole or in part from the bankruptcy proceedings. 5)When all of the assets were liquidated and it was determined what amount was actually available for division the wife was awarded 56% of the net proceeds to the respondent and 44% to the wife. 6)Each side was to bear their own costs."

The 38 year old had 49 prior convictions. The sentencing judge noted the accused's 3.5 years of sobriety, community support, education and technical trade training, and positive pre-sentence report but failed to consider the gravity of the offences, the need for deterrence, and above all, protection of the public.

SaskPower sought an order pursuant to Queen's Bench Rule 547 to require the plaintiffs to post security for costs on the ground Wind Power was a non-resident plaintiff with little or no assets in the province of Saskatchewan. HELD: The motion was dismissed.  1)Rule 547 is limited to cases where the plaintiff is a non-resident or where the defendant is given a statutory right to apply. Wind Power is an Alberta company extra-provincially registered in Saskatchewan. Dove Industries, a Saskatchewan company incorporated specifically to develop a pilot project in Saskatchewan which did not proceed, had shareholders in the province. 2)Given the amount of the claim against SaskPower in the amount of $6,400,000 and the significant claim for costs in excess of $50,000 the Court would have granted the security for costs but for the delay by SaskPower in bringing its application. The action was commenced in April 1996. Unexplained delay by a defendant in seeking security for costs will prevent the grant of an order. To make an award for security for costs at this stage would place a burden on the plaintiffs and possibly prevent the action from taking place at the scheduled time.  3)The plaintiff was awarded one set of costs in any event of the cause.","FIAT. The defendant sought an order pursuant to Queen's Bench Rule 547 requiring the plaintiffs to post security for its costs in this action on the grounds that Wind Power Inc. was a non-resident plaintiff with little or no assets in Saskatchewan and Dove Industries was a corporation which wasincorporated specifically for a wind power demonstration project which did not proceed (and which was related to thesubject matter of this action) and accordingly had little or No assets in the province.

c_1998canlii12344.txt,"At issue was whether the right of appeal to a board of revision against a municipal tax assessment was exercised properly having regard for s303(1) of the Rural Municipality Act and how and when notice was given. The company posted the notice of appeal by registered mail the day before the expiration of the 20 day appeal period. The notice arrived at the post office on a Friday, the day after the period expired and was picked up by the administrator the following Monday. The Appeals Committee refused to direct the board of revision to hear the appeal on the basis the company failed to give notice within the period prescribed by s303(1) and concluded that the board did not have the power to extend the time. HELD: The appeal was allowed. The board of revision was directed to hear and determine the assessment appeal. 1)The Committee did not err in deciding the prescribed time period for an appeal could not be extended.  2)The less formal expression 'to give notice to' as used in the Act is a less exacting term than 'to serve notice upon'. Wascana Energy exercised its right of appeal properly, or at least effectively, requiring the board of revision to entertain the appeal.","The question in this case was whether the right of appeal to a board of revision against a municipal tax assessment was exercised properly, or at least effectively, having regard for the governing provisions of the statute and the fact of how and when notice of appeal was given. HELD: The appeal from the decision of the Committee will be allowed, with costs as usual, and there will be an order directing the board of revisions to hear and determine the company's appeal. 1)The phrase'may give notice in writing' must be taken by implication to allow for notice to be given by means of registered mail. This is a less formal expression suggesting a less exacting term. Moreover, it is an Act of such commonplace application as to strongly suggest notice might be given via registered mail, applying as it does to almost everyone in every corner of the rural areas of the Province, and falling as it did to be applied by local people with no special training, except for the administrators. 2)There was no prejudice in the way the legislature decided to interpret the provisions of s. 303(1) of the Act. The legislature did not expressly provide for the effect of imperfect compliance or noncompliance with the requirements of the subsection nor did any other form of prejudice arise. Rather, it intended to use the word give as importing the necessity of receipt. This would add a desirable measure of bureaucratic certainty to the appeal process. Notice of appeal could then be acted upon only if received before the 20 day period expires, not otherwise, not even if received in sufficient time to enable the board to meet the appeal in keeping with the taxing scheme of the enactment.  3)The word give is importing the necessary of receipt, just as the Committee did. In the circumstances, this amounts to substantial compliance of near perfect sort, which amounts to a reasonable degree of compliance. In this case, the phrase may give notice by mail (ie. fax) could not be taken to mean in sufficient compliance therewith. 4)The appeal could only be entertained if the notice did not arrive within 20 days of the mailing or delivery of the notice. This was especially true in the circumstances for the assessment had not been completed well in advance of May 31st. 5)The delay in hearing and determining the appeal had nothing to do with the delay but with the fact that the notice had been sent but not received within the prescribed period.  6)The legislature intended nothing short of fatal."
3_2002skca102.txt,"The accused applied for a stay of proceedings on the ground the Crown failed to provide adequate disclosure. In making disclosure, the Crown appended a copy of the respondent's criminal record to its affidavit.

The Crown appealed the order which prohibited the judge from continuing as trial judge in respect to the respondent's criminal charges of impaired driving, driving with blood alcohol levels exceeding .08, and dangerous driving.

The judge in this case said she had not read the record, she was not biased as a result of the information tendered at the pre-trial proceedings and the record was something she could put out of her mind as she did in all instances where she ruled evidence inadmissible.

The respondent applied to the court for an order of prohibition. HELD: The appeal is allowed and the matter is remitted to Provincial Court for trial. 1)There is abundant authority that disclosure of an accused's criminal record to the Court, whether composed of a judge and jury or a jury alone, does not amount to an automatic disqualification of the court on the ground of apprehended bias, appearance of bias or other prejudice to the accused. Although it is the presiding judge to ensure a fair hearing, there is no law which guarantees that inadvertent, inadmissible evidence will not be introduced. If an error of that nature should occur, the error should be ignored, or, if it is deemed too significant to be ignored by the judge, a mistrial will be declared. 2)The respondent said that she had not read the record. If inadvertent errors should automatically result in termination of the proceedings, then more egregious, and perhaps deliberate, errors on the part of the Crown, or its witnesses, would necessitate no less result. In her view, the accused's rights as guaranteed by the Charter are not violated when the inadvertent error occurs."

The plaintiff sues the defendant, claiming a bonus for the 2004-2005 year and the 2005-2006 year. HELD: The claim is dismissed. In law an agreement to come to an agreement is not enforceable. This is especially true where an essential term regarding remuneration has not been agreed to. The parties agreed that they would settle on the bonus amount later on but they never did. The plaintiff believes he is still entitled to a bonus. The Court cannot make the agreement for the parties.",The parties to this action signed handwritten agreement on the 20th day of October 2004. The entire document reads as follows: Contract between the parties: The plaintiff is to provide labor and equipment necessary to feed and maintain the cows for a set price of $0.50 per day. The defendant is responsible for all incurred costs due to trucking and transporting the cows. In the year 2005-2006 the parties did not contemplate payment of bonus because the cows had been more carefully bread and calving was expected to occur and did occur in the more mild temperatures of April and May.

The defendant is being sued by the plaintiff for damage caused to a construction site under a bridge in Saskatoon. The damage is alleged to have been caused when the defendant's truck left the ramp leading onto the bridge and fell into an excavation pit. The defendant argues that the City should be added as a third party because the City did not take proper steps to clear snow from the ramp, which provided a surface for his vehicle to launch off of. HELD: The application to add the City of Saskatoon as a third party was granted. The applicant has made out a prima facie case against the proposed third party. There is no prejudice to the plaintiff because he has settled with his insurer and is requesting settlement with the defendant's insurer. There is a causal connection between the cause of action plead in the statement of claim and the third party notice. It is immaterial at this stage that the City may have an absolute defence.","FIAT: This is an application by Saskatchewan Government Insurance on behalf of the defendant for an order pursuant to Rule 107(c) of the Queen's Bench Rules and s.7 of the Contributory Negligence Act granting leave to the defendant to add the City of Saskatoon as a third party to this action. The defendant is being sued by the plaintiff for damage to a construction site under the Senator Sid Buckwold Bridge caused as a result of his truck leaving the surface of the road at the head of the bridge going over the guardrail and falling into the excavation pit. The plaintiff alleges that the road condition was icy on the exit ramp leading up to the bridge and the City had not taken steps to address the icy road surfaces. To refuse the application under s. of The Contributory negligence would likely result in the requirement for a second litigation process to be commenced, that being by the defendants against the proposed third party claiming contributory negligence.HELD: The application is granted as requested. 1)It is incumbent upon the Chambers judge to ascertain whether the defendant, Rocy (applicant), has filed material which establishes a prima facie claim against the City and whether there was any prejudice to the plaintiffs if the third party claim was to go forward as proposed.  2)The Court reviewed the pleadings and pleadings of the plaintiff and found that the defendant was a major player in undertaking the work which is the subject of the plaintiffs loss and claim. 3)The issue of prejudice could be addressed through direction and order from the Court on the combined process as an alternative.  4)The application is purely one of procedure and no substantive rights between the parties can be determined on it.

Prior to being sentenced, he spent 13 days on remand and 2 months under house arrest under s.7.1 of the Young Offenders Act. The Crown appealed the sentence. HELD: Appeal allowed. 1)The accused was 15 years of age and had no record. He assisted the police once apprehended. 2)Although another young offender involved in these offences had received a sentence of 9 months open custody, uniformity of sentence was not a factor to be given great weight in comparing dispositions of young offenders. 3)The sentence was increased to 10 months open custody.","The accused pled guilty to 16 counts of auto theft, 1 count of possession of stolen auto and one count of dangerous driving. He spent 13 days on remand and approximately 2 months under strict parental control on house arrest prior to receiving a disposition of 6 months open custody and 2 years probation. The Crown appeals the disposition arguing it is not fit having regard for the number of offences and the need to maintain the public's confidence in the administration of justice. HELD: Appeal allowed. 1)In addition to the large number of theft offences, the accused used a stolen vehicle in a high speed chase with the police resulting in extensive damage to the vehicle. 2)The Youth Court judge counted the time J.M. spent under house arrest as secure custody. 3)The accused made great change during the course of this period. He was given the opportunity to participate in the escape described in relation to the other youth and made the conscious decision not to do so.

The accused, charged with trafficking in a narcotic, sought an order for a judicial stay of proceedings pursuant to s.24(1) and (2) of the Charter on the basis his right under s.11(b) to be tried within a reasonable time has been breached. HELD: The application was dismissed. The delay was not unreasonable.  1)The 25 months between when the charge was laid in May 1996 and the trial date in November 1998 was sufficiant delay to raise the issue of the reasonableness of the delay. Defence did not waive delay. 2)There was no reason given for the three and one-half month delay between the swearing of the information and the arrest. The accused's right to a fair trial had not been prejudiced by the total time delay. His right to security of person and to liberty were not affected. 3)Seven months delay was due to scheduling delays resulting from defence's application to remove prosecution counsel who had previously represented the accused. The Crown acted in good faith in opposing the application and had a meritorious position. 4)All other proceedings were within the systemic guidelines. 5)Prejudice to his liberty was minor as he was on bail since shortly after his arrest.

6_2017skca42.txt,"Statutes – Interpretation – Limitation of Civil Rights Act, Section 2The appellants had granted a residential mortgage in favour of the respondent that secured a loan in the amount of $460,800. The loan was a consolidation of existing debt, part of which was the balance of $373,089 owed on the original loan that had enabled the appellants to purchase the land. The remaining $87,711 was non-purchase money financing approved by the respondent. The appellants fell into default, and the respondent commenced foreclosure proceedings when the balance owed had increased to $536,186. The property was sold through judicial listing orders and the net sale proceeds were paid to the respondent. As the proceeds were insufficient, the respondent sought an order entitling it to the deficiency. The Chambers judge considered s. 2 of The Limitation of Civil Rights Act (LCRA) and held that the amount of the deficiency should be $162,675.99. The issues on appeal were how the proceeds of sale should be applied against the mortgage balance and what the proper amount of the deficiency was. HELD: The appeal was allowed. The court reviewed the purpose and policy behind the LCRA. It then examined its conflicting decisions in Hrynewich Holdings and Andrews and held that the latter was a per incuriam judgment and therefore not binding and the approach set out in Hrynewich would guide the disposition of this appeal. Therefore, it found with respect to each issue that the holding in Hrynewich meant that payments should be allocated on a pro-rated basis to purchase money and non-purchase money debt balances and the proper amount of the deficiency to which the respondent was entitled to judgment against the appellants was $31,160.23.","This appeal concerns the application of s. of The Limitation of Civil Rights Act (LCRA) in relation to a motion for deficiency judgment by the respondent bank. The main issue relates to how the proceeds of sale of property by judicial listing should be applied against a mortgage balance when there are both purchase money and non-purchase money balances. The appellant relies upon the Court's decision in Andrew (CA) and the clear direction that the sale proceeds be applied to the purchase money portion. The respondent then seeks an order entitling it to the deficiency. Hrynewich Holdings respects the spirit and intent of the LCRA and accords with the policy behind the legislation as set out in this judgment. However, it was not intended to give the mortgagor immunity from liability for the portion of the indebtedness that was not purchase money funds and nothing in the section requires the mortgagee to treat its security as securing pro-rated amounts of the purchase, purchase, and purchase money portions of the debt. The appeal will deal with each issue in turn. A) the appeal is allowed with respect to the amount of the deficiency judgment; the respondent is entitled to take out the deficiency against the mortgage balance. B) the conclusion in CA would not have been made had it not been for the court's intervention and the legislature's intervention to stem this tide and prevent further disaster at the hands of aggressive financial institutions and creditors.  C) the decision of the Chambers judge considered s. 2 of The Land Contracts (Actions) Act and held that the amount owed to the respondent should be $162,675.72. The purchase money debt balance is decreased to $132,582.48 and is protected by s. III of the Saskatchewan Farm Security Act. The remaining LCRA protection is $31,160.23. HELD: Appeal allowed.  1) The Court was able to bring the matter to Queen’s Bench and it would have been appropriate had the matter been allowed to this extent. 2) In the interest of fairness the court found that the respondent was entitled to apply the realized security proceeds to the balance owing of the mortgage. The portion owed by the appellants was 64.03% ($60,000, $70,000 and $87,711.48) and was the correct interpretation to be placed on that provision.  2) The court reviewed the various decisions of the previous court and found that in the absence of a provision, neutral approach involves allocation of the payment on a pro rata"

Alternatively he sought an order preventing the mother from removing their daughter from Saskatchewan. The father obtained an ex parte order preventing the mother from removing the child from the province until the return date of the motion. The mother had always been the primary caregiver and had custody since the separation in 1994. The father had exercised regular and frequent access. She was given exclusive possession of the matrimonial home under the terms of the consent judgment which contemplated the home would be listed for sale and the net proceeds divided between the parties. Subsequent to the consent judgment the applicant went through bankruptcy proceedings in which he transferred his interest in the home to the trustee who then sold that interest to the respondent such that the applicant no longer had any interest in the home. HELD: 1)Relocation was neither foreseen nor reasonably contemplated by the judge making the original order. The threshold criteria was thus satisfied. 2)The trial of an issue was required as the matter could not be decided on the basis of affidavit evidence. The child had a close relationship with both parents. The disruption as a result of a change in custody or removal of the child from the community could not be assessed. 3)The applicant's request for interim relief was denied. If the mother proceeded with her move a revision of the access provision would be appropriate. 4)The child's best interest is the proper test to be applied (Cote) having regard to the factors identified by the Supreme Court of Canada in Gordon. 5)The applicant became aware in early June of the mother's intention to move to British Columbia and did not object. The timing of the application, a few weeks prior to the proposed move, raised the suspicion that it was the respondent's decision to sell the matrimonial home which prompted this application.  6)Costs were left to the trial judge.","This was an application to vary the terms of a consent judgment such that the applicant would havesole custody of his daughter from the Province of Saskatchewan. In the alternative the applicant sought an order preventing the respondent from removing their daughter from Saskatchewan. The parties separated in October 1994 and the daughter had been in the care of her mother since that time. The mother had been a stay-at-home mom and raised the daughter with the respondent. She indicated that she and the respondent had discussed the possibility of the applicant selling the furniture that she would not need and allowing the applicant to move back into the matrimonial home in exchange for car payments. The timing of the application raised the suspicion that it was the respondent's decision to sell the home that prompted this application. HELD: 1)The child had a close relationship with both parents, however that only scratched the surface in terms of the relationship between the two. The Court was not able to assess the effect of a disruption as a result of a change in custody or removal of the child from the community.  2)The respondent indicated that if there was an order made that the child not be removed from the jurisdiction until trial, she will not move to Kelowna.  3)The parties were unable to exercise their custody rights after the hearing of this motion. 4)The court was unable to determine whether the affidavits should be permitted on the basis of the motion filed."

8_2001nssc179.txt,"The defendant obtained a tender to bank, blend and load coal at the plaintiff's coal preparation plant. In performing the contract, the defendant experienced equipment problems resulting in the plaintiff having to rent equipment from the defendant's predecessor. The plaintiff terminated the contract without any prior warning or notice to the defendant and brought an action for reimbursement of monies advanced under the contract and expenses incurred for the equipment rentals. The defendant counter-claimed for damages arising out of the termination of the contract, for services performed under the contract and for extras which had not been paid. Plaintiff entitled to reimbursement for overpayments and equipment rentals; defendant entitled to fair and reasonable compensation for extras for which court awarded the sum of $10,000. Both parties were in breach of the contract, the plaintiff's breach occurring because the volumes of coal supplied did not approximate the tonnages represented in the contractual documents. The clause excluding liability for errors in the forecast did not excuse the plaintiff because the actual volumes were not even approximate to the forecasted tonnages and the rates bid by the defendant were directly related to the anticipated tonnages. Absent evidence as to how the plaintiff arrived at the information used in the calculation of the forecasted tonnages, no negligent misrepresentation could be found, as there was no evidence that the information was negligently obtained. In respect to claims where on the evidence there was a loss, but it was difficult, if not impossible to quantify, damages were awarded even where it could be said the amount is a matter of guesswork.","The plaintiff/defendant sought reimbursement of monies advanced under the contract and expenses it incurred for equipment rentals and other activities it claimed were required because of the failure of Roper Ltd. to perform the contract. The defendant counterclaimed for damages arising out of losses it suffered due to delays in the construction of the LBC on the basis that the equipment supplied by the defendant was not the same type and model as it listed in the response to the tender. The parties agreed to delay commencement of the contract until July on the defendant's assurance that he would be able to have the necessary equipment on site by that time. The plaintiff was awarded the contract with an order for $45,000.00. The contractual obligation to'maintain the banks' was to be construed by the wording in the contract, and any variation in wording between the original invitation for tender and the 1985 invitation for tenders is inconsequential. The court found that in the case the wording was different, the plaintiff's responsibilities were not as extensive as they would have been if the tender had been used, and that the plaintiff had confirmed in writing the purchase order as being the contract between the parties."

There was a no contact order in place pending the outcome of domestic violence charges against the father (who had not seen the child for four months). The mother had nothing positive to say about him. They disagreed about the extent of his marijuana use, and the extent of his involvement with the child.

The father must complete a parenting course to better learn how to meet the child's various needs. There was insufficient evidence to show he is unable to protect the child from her severe nut allergy. There was insufficient evidence to establish he is a flight risk. Even if he had threatened to flee with the child, it is relevant that he lacks the means to do so. While there has been unpleasantness and some violence between the parties, the evidence does not establish domestic violence of a nature that would require supervised access on an ongoing basis.",The mother sought to have the father's access supervised. The father had stopped living with the child since January 2010 because of his family ties in Egypt and Kuwait and because of the child's allergy to nuts and nut products. The mother worried that the father would be able to obtain an Egyptian passport for the child and because she was concerned that the child would be in danger of physical harm if she were left in the care of the father. The parties agreed there would need to be a gradual reintroduction between the father and child and that this should be managed by utilizing the services provided by Veith House. The Mother was the primary care parent.HELD: 1) The evidence from the parties was inconclusive as to whether the father knew what he was doing or did not know. 2) The father was to attend a course in parenting such as those offered by Family SOS so that he would be better prepared to parent the child. 3) There must be evidence to suggest there is a real likelihood that the parent making the threat has the child in his care. The evidence did not suggest that he fully understood how to properly care for a year old child. This does not mean he cannot learn how to perform the tasks required of him and to assist him in that regard. He would need training prior to caring for this child unsupervised.

If an employer dismisses an employee without good cause, he must give the employee reasonable notice or compensation in lieu of notice.
