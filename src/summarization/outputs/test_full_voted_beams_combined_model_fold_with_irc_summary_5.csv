"The applicant asks that the registration of mortgage against land be discharged on the basis that the limitation period to enforce the mortgage has expired. The respondent says the limitation time has not expired because The Saskatchewan Farm Security Act, 1988-89, c. S-17.1 provides for a suspension of limitation time running while certain proceedings are underway pursuant to that Farm Security act. HELD: The application is dismissed.  1) The Court found that the application to discharge s. 22 of the Farm SecurityAct as set out in s. 11(1) of the Limitations Act did not have an expiration date. 2) The application to continue the limitation by way of s. 12(16) was deemed to have expired. 3) The applicant was entitled to the costs of her application against the respondent.","Limitation of Actions – Mortgage – Saskatchewan Farmland SecurityHELD: When s. 12 of The Saskatchewan Farm Security Act was enacted it was the legislature’s intention that a mortgagee, to whom The Saskatchewan Farm Security Act applied, could suspend the limitation period clock from running and after serving a notice of intention to enforce its security, provided that within three years of such service the mortgagee made application to the court for an order under s. 11 permitting it to commence an enforcement action. If the three years for making such an application expires without an application being made, the limitation period begins to run again.

The applicant sought approval of the Court for a settlement of the personal injury claim on behalf of the infant plaintiff. The issue before the Court was the amount of the Contingency Fee Agreement payable to the petitioner. The petitioner had not registered the Contringency Fee Agreements with the Prothonotary's Office as required and the matter had been adjourned for one week pending receipt of a Memorandum of Law. Counsel were instructed to present to the Court an appropriate bond. This bond was approved.,"The applicant sought approval of the Court for a settlement reached on behalf of the infant plaintiff, who had been injured in an automobile accident.

"The appellant was convicted of having care and control of a motor vehicle while his blood alcohol content exceeded 80 milligrams of alcohol in 100 millilitres of blood, contrary to s. 253(b) of the Criminal Code. He appealed his conviction. Corrigendum received dated March 6, 2015 and added to fulltext. HELD: The appeal was granted.  1) Given the presumption in s. 258(1)(c)(iv) that the person who occupies the driver's seat is deemed to have care or control, the trial judge considered whether the appellant had rebutted the presumption so as to rebut the presumption of accuracy, he had no reasonable doubt as to the guilt of the accused. The Court of Appeal allowed the appeal from the bench and, rather than ordering a fourth trial, stayed the proceedings.  2) Given that the presumption is rebutting, the appellant was found to have been in actual care of control. The trial judge in this case adopted the reasoning of Green P.C.J. at the second trial and adopted his own reasoning. He found that, just barely, in the opinion of the appellant, he was definitely in actual control of his vehicle at the time of the offence. He also found that the RCMP did not err in not asking the appellant what he had been drinking that day and whether he had consumed beer within fifteen minutes of taking the roadside test. The Crown did not take issue with the appellant's assertion that his consumption of beer was the two beers at the scene and that he was simply mistaken for to the amount of alcohol he consumed that day or was deliberately misleading the Court in an attempt to defeat this charge. 3) The evidence of the roadside instrument and the Intoxilizer readings simply could not have been obtained by the consumption of one or two beers while stopped at the roadside in the manner the accused described. Prosecutorial misconduct and improper motivation are but two of many factors to be taken into account when a Crown seeks to re-lay the indictment. The appellant has not established an abuse of process. The facts of the case are unremarkable. It's not one of those clearest of cases where the court should direct a judicial stay.","The appeal was allowed, and rather than order a new trial, the charge was stayed. The issues were decided as follows: 1) the trial judge was found to have applied the wrong test as to de facto care and control of the vehicle. The appeal on the first ground was dismissed, however, because the Crown could rely on the presumption in s. 258(1)(c); the accused had been driving 10 minutes before the stop and within two hours of the breath tests, so whether he was in de facto care and control at the time of the stop was irrelevant and did not result in a miscarriage of justice; 2) there was no evidence of the failure to observe the appellant while the breath tests were administered, nor was there a suggestion of the significance of the failure to do so, therefore, the appeal on that ground was dismissed; 3) the trial judge also addressed the issue of evidence if the 2008 amendments did not apply and the appellant was therefore not prejudiced in this regard. The appellant nonetheless argued that the trial judge erred in law by misapprehending evidence. The appeal court concluded that the trial judge did not err in law because his reasons did not disclose that he failed to consider relevant evidence relating to a material issue;  4) the Crown conceded that the 2008 amendments did not apply retroactively. The appeal court found that the trial judge was incorrect in giving a strong message to the unrepresented appellant that there was no point in tendering evidence on the accuracy of the Intoxilyzer results. The trial judge’s comments strongly suggested that the only expert evidence that would be relevant would be with respect to equipment malfunction and not operator error. The appeal was granted on this ground because the trial judge’s comments were found to compromise trial fairness resulting in an error of law; 5) the s. 9 Charter breach was not raised by the appellant at trial but it was raised in his brief following trial, and therefore the appeal court found that the trial judge was obliged to decide whether or not to consider the issue. The appeal was also allowed on this ground because the trial judge did not comply with his duty to consider the issue and the appeal court could not determine whether the failure to give reasons resulted in a miscarriage of justice; and 6) there was no issue of trial fairness. The appeal court concluded that there would be prejudice to the integrity of the justice system that would be manifested if the appellant had a fourth trial. Nine and a half years passed since the offence date and the facts of the case were less serious than some drinking and driving cases. Also, there was no other remedy available to remedy the wrong. The balancing of interests also led the court to conclude that this was one of those clearest of cases calling for a stay of proceedings.",9_2014skqb386.txt,"The appeal was allowed, and rather than order a new trial, the charge was stayed.

"The appellant was convicted of criminal negligence causing death and causing bodily harm arising out of her operation of a motor vehicle. She appealed her conviction and raised numerous grounds of appeal. The appellant was found guilty of criminal liability causing death (s. 220); causing death in the operation of motor vehicle while impaired by alcohol (s.) 255(3); criminal negligence in the performance of bodily harm (s."") and causing death while impaired (s).

"HELD: The appeals were dismissed. The court found that the respondent had no standing to bring his application pursuant to s. 222(d) of the Act and that the Chambers judge made errors in his approach to the application. The appeal court found: that the respondents had not followed the proper process and that they had not imposed their own preordained outcome. The respondent was a 'proper person' to bring the application; the Court of Queen's Bench found that this was an overly restrictive view of the relevant provisions of the act. The controverted election cases are not applicable in the circumstances of this case. The decision of the Elections Board is set aside pursuant to the Act. The Chambers judge did not err in finding that the majority of students voted in favour of joining the Federation. The issue is whether the organization acted in good faith and generally in accord with the broad rules of natural justice. HELD: Appeal dismissed.  1) The court was entirely satisfied that the applicant was a proper person to bring this application. It is important not to confuse the statutory concepts of oppression, unfair prejudice and unfair disregard with the concepts of common law that typically form the basis of judicial review applications such as the one considered in Walton v. Saskatchewan Hockey Association. 2) The Court found that it was not necessary to work through the merits of the arguments because, regardless of how they might play out, the Court was entirely convinced that the application was premature. The applicant had standing to apply and the relief awarded by the Chambers court was appropriate.  3) The applicant was not entitled to a share in the relief offered.","These appeals concern a referendum on the question of whether the University of Saskatchewan Student's Union should join the Canadian Federation of Students (the Federation). The referendum was held in the fall of 2005. A majority of the students voted in favour of joining the Federation. The respondent Robin Mowat then applied to the Court of Queen's Bench pursuant to The Non-profit Corporations Act (the Act) and obtained an order declaring the referendum to be of no force or effect. The Federation and the Student's Union now seek to overturn that order. They argue that Mowat had no standing to bring his application and that the Chambers judge erred in his application of the relevant statutory provisions. HELD: The appeals must be dismissed. 1) The respondent is a 'proper person' to bring the application pursuant s. 222(d) of the Act. He was attending the University and very actively involved on campus and the referendum campaign. Over 44% of the students voted against joining the Federation. The Act gives the right to make an application to a complainant, not to a complainant who speaks for a significant portion of the members of a corporation. The fact that the respondent's application was argued a few months after the respondent had convocated should not defeat his right to bring his concerns forward. An individual's status as a student is inevitably temporary. There is no justice in denying the respondent's standing only because the process for reviewing the referendum results played out so slowly that he was unable to bring the matter before a court prior to the date of his convocation.  2) The Controverted election cases are not applicable in the circumstances of this case. Section 225 of the Act creates and delimits a statutory remedy for particular kinds of corporate conduct. The assessment of an application pursuant to s. 225 of the Act must be measured against the concepts of oppression, unfair prejudice and unfair disregard as provided in that section. Administrative law concepts should be imported into that analysis only with considerable care and only for the purpose of giving meaning to the statutory terms found in the section itself. 3) The critical point is that the Council abandoned a formal process which had been put in place specifically to address the very significant concerns raised by the respondent and other about the referendum. Whether that turn of events was somehow inevitable is not the real issue. Rather, the essence of this case is the unfairness and prejudice the Council's decision involved for those who had opposed joining the Federation. It is unnecessary to look more closely at the specific problems that arose in relation to the referendum process. The decision of the Student's Union to override the decision of the Elections Board was itself something that warranted the granting of relief pursuant to s. 225 of the Act.",5_2007skca90.txt,"These appeals concern a referendum on the question of whether the University of Saskatchewan Student's Union should join the Canadian Federation of Students (the Federation).

"The accused was charged with operating a motor vehicle while his ability was impaired by alcohol under ss.255(1) and 253(a) of the Criminal Code and with having consumed alcohol in such a quantity that his blood alcohol level exceeded.08 contrary to ss.253(b) and 255(1). The trial judge concluded that the impaired driving charge was stronger than the.08 and, in his opinion, a conviction only for impaired driving. HELD: The appeal was allowed and the conviction set aside. In this case, the trial judge made no errors in law. The decision of the Provincial Court Judge was not used to avoid a multiple conviction issue. The entry of a judicial stay on the.07 count was not a use to avoid the impaired driver issue. Volume of consumption falls within the provisions of s.253. The mechanism for doing so is the entering of a review of readings contained in Certificate of Analysis; and, if the accused appeals the conviction on the more serious charge and is successful, the matter may be remitted to the Provincial trial judge to determine whether a conviction should be entered on that charge.","The accused was charged with impaired driving contrary to s. 255(1) and s. 253(a) of the Criminal Code and with driving while over .08 contrary to s. 253(b) and s. 255(1) of the Criminal Code. The accused was convicted of impaired driving. An initial question is whether the trial judge's decision reflected a conviction on both counts or a conviction only for the impaired driving charge. HELD: The appeal is allowed and the conviction is set aside with an order that a new trial be held. 1) The court found a conviction was not entered on the .08 charge and the judicial stay was not used by the trial judge to avoid a multiplicity of convictions. 2) There was an error in law in that the trial judge relied at least in part on the certificate readings for his conclusion of impairment. What the verdict would have been, absent the trial judge's consideration of the certificate, is not clear. The matter must be resolved in favour of the accused.

"HELD: The appeal was allowed and the decision of the Board of Revenue Commissioners reversed. Husky appealed. The issue before the court was whether the word 'published' qualifies the words which precede it or whether it relates to the purposes for which the book, literary or technical papers or loose-leaf sheets were published. HELD: Appeal allowed. 1)The Board found that the subject documentation would constitute 'technical papers' and accordingly fall within the definition of 'books'. The only obstacle then was to qualify for an exemption under s.8(1)(f) is that the technical papers must be published and that they contain no advertising. The Board determined as finding of fact that the documents was not required for preparing the valves for use in Saskatchewan and there was evidence before the Board upon which it was open to them to come to that conclusion. 2)The respondent did not pay taxon what is referred to asDocumentation charges. Section 22 of the Revenue and Financial Services Act requires that findings of fact made by the Board are to be accepted and applied in any judicial review of the board's decision. It is of no consequence but might say that find no difficulty in accepting the Board's conclusion on this important factual determination.","The respondent conducted an audit resulting in the assessment of sales tax. Husky Oil appealed the decision by the Board of Revenue Commissioners which held Husky liable to pay tax on documentation charges. The primary function of the documentation was ongoing technical support for the valves operation, maintenance and modifications. The valves and documentation were identified as separate items on the same purchase order and arrived at the job site separately. The Board decided that the appellant purchased the documentation independent of the valves and were subject to tax under ss.5(9) unless exempted under ss.8(1)(f). The parties agreed the documents fell within the definition of tangible property as set out in the Act. At issue was the interpretation by the Board of the word 'published' as used in ss.5(1)(b) of eg. 1 when defining the word 'books' and whether the drawings were exempt from tax. HELD: The appeal was allowed and the decision of the Board reversed. Costs were awarded to the appellant. 1)The role of the Court was in the nature of judicial review and supervisory in nature. The Court's role on questions of fact is restricted to circumstances where the evidence does not support findings of fact. 2)There was evidence which could support either interpretation of the facts.  3)The determination of whether the documents were required for preparing the property for use in Saskatchewan is a question of fact. There was nothing technical about the statutory requirement. The words used are simple and ordinary. It was open to the Board to determine as a finding of fact that the documentation was not required for preparing the valves for use. 4)Technical papers by their nature are often going to a narrow audience. To focus upon the extent to which technical papers are directed at a public audience so as to determine their taxability makes no sense and is at odds with the proposition that technical papers can be exempt from tax.

"The Crown applied for leave to appeal pursuant to s. 839 of the Criminal Code. The Court granted leave and allowed the appeal in judgment from the bench. HELD: The appeal was allowed orally. The court found that the trial judge erred in both ways. The trial judge did not refer to the actual threat, if any, faced by the accused and did not address the respondent's belief that he was being threatened; and the proportionality of his response. The appellant's mistake of fact was reasonable and he did not focus on the fact there were two officers present. It is not unreasonable for the appellant to believe that he is in imminent danger of death or grievous bodily harm and that his action was necessary in self-defence to be reasonable. However, the appeal judge did err in the ways he did in failing to consider the factors of the three witnesses.","The accused, a member of the RCMP, was convicted after trial of assault with a weapon contrary to s. 267(1)(a). The accused successfully appealed his conviction to the Court of Queen's Bench where a new trial was ordered. The Queen's Bench Judge held that the trial judge's reasons were inconsistent on the whether the accused reasonably believed that he was about to be grievously harmed and that the trial judge erred by not considering the evidence of the other police officer who testified at the trial. The Crown appealed to the Court of Appeal arguing that the summary conviction appeal judge misinterpreted the trial judge's reasons and exceeded the bounds of appellate review.

The trial judge engaged in classical alternative reasoning. While the trial judge did not refer to all of the evidence, he did not err in failing to do so. The trial judge grappled with the substance of the issues presented at the trial which were whether the accused had been assaulted by the complainant, whether the accused reasonably believed that he was being assaulted and whether his response was proportionate.

"The plaintiff city appealed a decision of a tribunal sitting as a tribunal under The Saskatchewan Human Rights Code in the matter of complaints filed by the plaintiff. The plaintiff claimed that the City had discriminated against him on the basis of his disability. The tribunal had found that the plaintiff was not prejudiced by the considerable time that elapsed since the complaint took place; the plaintiff had been given temporary employment, which allowed him to continue his employment as a casual employee; and the court found that, because of the plaintiff’s disability, the City did not have a duty to accommodate him in regard to his employment. The court awarded the plaintiff $8,902.00 as wages and benefits, and an order of protection against future discrimination based on the manner in which the provisions of the Code were applied to the employment contract. The decision of the tribunal was also found to have been reasonably accurate in so determining the amount of compensation the plaintiff would receive for his lost wages. The discrimination was severe and it was impossible for the plaintiff to gain employment with the City. He had received employment insurance from CUPE for 15 years. He lived in poverty and suffered from Cerebral Palsy. He was denied employment insurance when he was laid off in the fall due to lack of income and pension entitlement. He suffered from post-traumatic stress disorder and lost his ability to work and the ability to pay his disability pension and health insurance which he had received as part of a disability-related disability pension. He sought and was granted temporary employment insurance in the spring of 1999. HELD: The appeal was dismissed with costs. 1)The plaintiff had irreparable harm to himself, his family, friends and the community. His disability prevented him from obtaining employment insurance for the 15 years he had been employed with the city. He would not have been able to obtain employment insurance had it not been for the disability. 2)The court was unable to find that the city was responsible for the discrimination because the plaintiff failed to demonstrate a reasonable basis for the claim. It was also unable to establish a claim for employment insurance due to the discrimination against him due to his disability and the fact that he had not been compensated for his time in the position. 3)There was no evidence that the discrimination resulted in the plaintiff earning less than other casual employees in the employment position. The fact that many of the casual employees who had been hired by the City as truck drivers and then moved to permanent positions during the course of the complaint denied the plaintiff employment insurance because the entry-level position was","This is an appeal by the City of Regina (the City) and Canadian Union of Public Employees Local 21 (CUPE) from a decision of the Tribunal under The Saskatchewan Human Rights Code (the Code) in the matter of complaints filed by the respondent against the City and CUPE. It became clear that the main issues on the appeal were the duty to accommodate and the alleged resignation of the respondent. The respondent filed a complaint under Part II of the Code alleging that CUPE and the City discriminated against him on the basis of his disability. The Commission substantiated this allegation before the Tribunal by showing there was a discriminatory impact on the respondent as a result of the seniority system established by the collective agreements in force from time to time between the City and CUPE. The Tribunal found that all of the efforts made in response to the respondent did not deal directly and effectively with his claim that the seniority standards in the collective agreement were discriminatory towards him on the basis of his disability. The Tribunal agreed with the Commission that their efforts were too little too late to reverse the systemic discrimination. The accommodations did not meet the duty to accommodate short of undue hardship. The Tribunal found that the City and CUPE contravened s. 16 and s. 18(1) of the Code by discriminating against the respondent on the basis of his disability. HELD: The appeals by the City and CUPE on liability are dismissed. The parties were allowed to refer the issue of damages to the Tribunal. 1) The superior expertise of human rights tribunal is confined to fact finding and decision making in the context of human rights and therefore reasonableness is the test for judicial review. If the issue is one of law, the standard of review is one of correctness. In other words, the appropriate standard of review by superior court of factual determination is whether the decision is patently unreasonable. Where human rights commission is required to interpret laws of general application, the correctness test applies. 2) The Court agreed with the Commission that the seniority system prevented a person such as the respondent from ever getting a permanent position, without accommodation, by giving priority to all those who could work more hours or gain permanent status by being flexible enough to work at the wide range of positions that the City had to offer. The respondent could not take advantage of this reward system because he could only bid into truck driver positions. The City and CUPE were too late in developing the plan. The plan was conceived in early 1999 to be executed when the respondent reached the top of the seniority list, probably in about 2000. But by this time, he was unable to work. 3) The characterization of the order of the Tribunal is not to direct the respondent be given a permanent position despite the seniority rights of others. It is to give him the benefits he would have had if his seniority had accrued in a non-discriminatory manner. 4) Whether CUPE had knowledge of the problem is irrelevant. The breach occurs as soon as there is discrimination. The City and CUPE are jointly responsible where a collective bargaining agreement that they negotiated is discriminatory. 5) For either the City or CUPE to avoid liability they must discharge their duty to accommodate up to the point of undue hardship. 6) The Tribunal's finding that there was no undue hardship is supported by the evidence. There are approximately 1,400 casual and permanent positions. Moving the respondent up the seniority list would have relegated certain union members in a large bargaining unit by one, which is insignificant. If this occurred, although the respondent would obtain the next permanent position, this would not be in disregard of the rights of other employees. Neither the City nor CUPE presented any evidence that would establish that a retroactive adjustment itself would create an undue hardship in the context that it would cause the seniority list to become unmanageable or ambiguous. It is not without significance that even if the membership of CUPE opposed the placing of the respondent into a permanent position, this by itself does not justify a finding of undue hardship. 7) The mandate of the Tribunal, once a finding of discrimination is made, is to determine what losses are caused by the discriminatory conduct. The Tribunal found that the respondent's resignation was one effect of the discrimination. The Court found there was no merit to this ground of appeal.",e_2004skqb372.txt,"This is an appeal by the City of Regina (the City) and Canadian Union of Public Employees Local 21 (CUPE) from a decision of the Tribunal under The Saskatchewan Human Rights Code (the Code) in the matter of complaints filed by the respondent against the City and CUPE. It became clear that the main issues on the appeal were the duty to accommodate and the alleged resignation of the respondent. The respondent filed a complaint under Part II of the Code alleging that CUPE and the City discriminated against him on the basis of his disability. The Commission substantiated this allegation before the Tribunal by showing there was a discriminatory impact on the respondent as a result of the seniority system established by the collective agreements in force from time to time between the City and CUPE. The Tribunal found that all of the efforts made in response to the respondent did not deal directly and effectively with his claim that the seniority standards in the collective agreement were discriminatory towards him on the basis of his disability. The Tribunal agreed with the Commission that their efforts were too little too late to reverse the systemic discrimination. The Tribunal found that the City and CUPE contravened s. 16 and s. 18(1) of the Code by discriminating against the respondent on the basis of his disability. HELD: The appeals by the City and CUPE on liability are dismissed. The parties were allowed to refer the issue of damages to the Tribunal. 2) The Court agreed with the Commission that the seniority system prevented a person such as the respondent from ever getting a permanent position, without accommodation, by giving priority to all those who could work more hours or gain permanent status by being flexible enough to work at the wide range of positions that the City had to offer.

"The accused, who was charged with aggravated assault, use or threatened use of weapon and failure to comply with his recognizance related to alcohol and weapon possession, was given his Charter rights. He was asked if he understood his right to have counsel then and there, and his response was that he was simply too drunk to remember what happened that day. The police had been aware that he had returned to the porch some time after 6:00 p.m. and that he, too, was in a state of shock. He went to the hospital, where he was treated for a head injury, and was released by ambulance. During the course of his detention, the accused made several incoherent ramblings about Paul McCartney but then turned to the accused and said, 'Is he dead? He beat me so beat him back.' The accused's mind wandered off to the need to acquire counsel to represent him at trial and he did not understand his rights. His response created enough uncertainty for the court to make a clarification such as, 'Brian, you have the right to counsel now before you make any statement to us'. It would be egregious to allow admission of the videotaped statement into evidence. There was a low threshold in the degree of drunkenness, voluntariness and see no evidence of oppression, threats or promises at this juncture. Access to counsel is the gateway of Charter rights particularly in these circumstances where this statement is the only evidence to be offered by the Crown in seeking conviction.","The accused was charged with aggravated assault, use of a weapon, unlawful possession of a weapon and breach of a recognizance.

"The City applied for a strike out of the third party claim on the basis that it did not disclose a reasonable cause of action. The plaintiffs alleged the defendant's actions or omissions of the city's fire department either caused the plaintiffs loss, or contributed to it. Hagblom Constructions applied for leave to bring third party proceedings. The claim was advanced in contract and in tort. HELD: The application was dismissed. The court granted the defendants leave to proceed on a motion requesting leave. The third parties had not established that the impugned claim could succeed. It was argued that the provisions of s. 136.1(2) of The Urban Municipality Act, 1984 prevented the defendants from taking proceedings against the third parties in this case and, if so, should the entire third party claims be struck out pursuant to Queen's Bench Rule 173(a)? 1) The claim is arguable. It is stated in the pleadings of the parties that the cause of the action is the common law and not the fact that the third Parties did not act in good faith. If this is established then it is clear that the statutory limitations would not nullify the third Party claim. 2) The third party claimants need not be satisfied that the defendants have deliberately destroyed evidence or that they did so in goodfaith. The defendants owe a duty to assist the thirdparty in gathering evidence. The only reasonable ground of appeal is that the statements of claim disclose a cause of act. The common law does not disclose this evidence. Third parties must not be in good standing to bring a third party action. It would be impossible for the defendants to accomplish their stated duty. 3) The only defence the third would be to attack the city for failing to act in a reasonable manner is the allegation of negligence for an omission to act, which is not an arguable case. The principles of the Rule of Law and the Contributory Negligence Act prevent the defendants, who are subject to their duty to act reasonably, from taking action against third parties. The Court held that the common laws do not disclose evidence of reasonable cause. 4) The Court was satisfied that there was no evidence that the Third Parties did act in bad faith. The allegations were relevant in respect to the contention that the defendant did not owe a statutory duty to the third. If the statutory limitation would not be established then the Court was clear that statutory limitations could not nullified the third-party claim.","An application to strike out the third party claim as not disclosing a reasonable cause of action.

"This was an appeal from a decision of a Family Court judge declining to rescind an order in 1993 for permanent care and custody of the appellant's granddaughter.

Unfortunately, the adoption plans did not materialize because the mother had a drug dependency problem. The husband reported the problem to the Agency, which it sought its intervention because he alone could not care for the child. The appellant sought rescission on the authority of the Family Court Rule 15:07 and 15:08.

The actions taken by both Redhead and Hyndman were taken for the benefit of Standard in an attempt to keep it operational. As it turned out, neither Redhead nor the plaintiff benefited from this arrangement for very long and both lost money.  5)The facts did not satisfy me on a balance of probabilities that this was an appropriate circumstance for an award in favour of the plaintiff based on either quantum meruit or unjust enrichment.  6)Reasons for the action: 1)Although there was no specific contract regarding the repair of the leased vehicles, it was clear that the defendant did make some payments on behalf of Standard. The defendant made some payments for the plaintiff's benefit. Both parties benefited from the arrangement for the purposes of keeping it operational; and 7)Cost of the claim was also dismissed. 8)The only notes of the meeting were made by the plaintiff. He did not know how the repairs were authorized for Standard. All of the invoices marked unpaid and claimed at trial continued to be sent to the address for Standard at 417 Maxwell Crescent in Regina. There was no correspondence between the parties confirming the terms of the agreement.  9)The claim of unpaid repairs against the defendant was not proven.  10)The defendants were awarded taxable costs.  11)The amount of damages for breach of contract for the outstanding lease payments and the outstanding parts and service account was reduced from the amount in question to the amount owing for repairs and pre-judgment interest to be calculated from March 28, 1994 to the date of judgment pursuant to The Pre-Judgment Interest Act.","An action for payments owing on vehicles leased by Standard from Redhead and for parts and labour supplied by Redhead to the leased vehicles.

"HELD: The plaintiff was awarded judgment for $12,394.22 plus pre-judgment interest and costs of the action. The court found that the plaintiff’s dismissal from his employment was for just cause. The plaintiff had not done his job well and sought damages for wrongful dismissal. He sought punitive or aggravated damages.  1)The plaintiff had been employed from year to year and his duties as guidance counsellor included supervising and supervising the administration of post secondary education programs. His employment was terminated in 1997 when he was still employed as co-ordinator of the program. He had not complied with the requirements of the Indian and Northern Affairs Canada Board of Directors. 2)Although he had been a relatively long term employee, the plaintiff had his qualifications and he was essentially entitled to no more than the contract provided for. He suffered from post-traumatic stress disorder, embarrassment, loss of confidence and loss of income due to poor performance and lack of understanding of and appreciation for the work and the people he had served as a mentor to and for. 3)There was no evidence of insubordination by the board members. It was accepted that they had a moral duty to act in the best interest of their children and to provide appropriate support and encouragement to the plaintiff. 4)In addition to his salary, the defendant was to receive pre-judicial interest on the amount owing to the court.","The plaintiff was the coordinator of post-secondary education programs for White Bear First Nation, between 1990 until his termination in May 1997. The plaintiff managed post-secondary programs with an annual budget of $960,000, taught upgrading and university entrance courses, and supervised other teaching and support staff. In 1996 an education board was established and given the task of overseeing the administration of the education complex and its teaching programs. There was overlap between the plaintiff and the board's mandate and functions that led to conflict. The board suspended the plaintiff for 10 days during which time it intended to investigate the plaintiff's conduct. The suspension continued and the board later passed a resolution formally terminating the plaintiff's employment. The plaintiff sued for wrongful dismissal. The defendant contended it dismissed the plaintiff with cause. HELD: The plaintiff was wrongfully dismissed. The court ruled that the employer had to provide evidence demonstrating serious employee misconduct. There was no such evidence produced by the defendant, and it was not enough simply to show a loss of confidence in the plaintiff or dissatisfaction with his job performance. The plaintiff's damages were limited to being paid out the end of his term contract. Punitive and aggravated damages were not allowed.

"The parties met, married, made children and then separated. The respondent father is part of a farming partnership with two brothers and two cousins. They have not settled a division of matrimonial property. Issues [1] What amounts, if any, are to be added to the sources of income set out in the father's total income in his T1 General form to come to the appropriate level of income for the purpose of calculating child maintenance payments? HELD: 1) The respondent's income is $29,983 and he shall pay to the petitioner for the support of Reidar and Bronwyn. The Court will deal with these issues on a year-by-year basis. 2) Personal expenses claimed in partnership returns as farm expenses (vi) Capital cost allowance on real property owned by the partnership; and (vii) Capital Cost allowance on personal property owned through the partnership. These expenses are legitimate expenses used to reduce income unless it is shown they are unnecessary or unreasonable. There is nothing to suggest the partnership is organizing its expenses or distribution to artificially lower the income of the father. In 2003, 2004 and 2005 the income was $28,963 and the respondent was in a small credit position which he could offset against ongoing maintenance but in amount no greater than $50 per month so as not to cause any inappropriate financial hardship on the children. 3) The Court was not prepared to add back any of the respondent's personal expenses to this date. The analysis of add-back becomes appropriate only to the extent of $50. The father will be in a very small position but can offset against the capital cost allowance. The adjustment can be made when the issue was finally determined. Assuming that the father had been making the maintenance payments as ordered, he will be able to offset the full amount claimed for capital cost allowances but in an amount no higher than $40 per month to not cause any financial hardship upon the children when arrears occur. When arrear occurs, this Court often allows those arrenars to be paid monthly. 4) The father shall pay the petitioner $568 per month for support of the Knudson children commencing October 1, 2005 and continuing every month thereafter until a child is no longer a child within the meaning of the Divorce Act.  5) The parties have approached this case on the basis that the most representative and fairest method of determining this self-employed father's income for child support purposes is a three-year average under s17 of the Guidelines. The Guidelines do not","The respondent father is part of farming partnership with two brothers and two cousins running mixed grain and cattle operation. Division of the matrimonial property is at issue. The issues include what amounts, if any, are to be added to the sources of income set out in the father's total income in his T1 General form to come to the appropriate level of income for the purpose of calculating child maintenance payments. HELD: 1) The father's income has fluctuated significantly in the last years, and the inherent nature of farming is such that it is more appropriate in the circumstances to this operation to use year average. 2) Non-arm's length salary will be added back into income unless the father established that payments were necessary and reasonable. In 2004 the amount of salary paid to the mother for bookkeeping was $5,000. It would appear that the $15,000 paid in 2003 was means of splitting income. $5,000 appears to be reasonable amount. 3) Some of the personal expenses claimed as farm expenses such as electricity, home heat, telephone, meals and office expenses should be added back to income. The father has added back portion of these expenses based on certain percentages being allocated to personal use. It has not been established that more amounts need to be added back. 4) The majority of the capital cost allowance on personal property owned by the father relates to his motor vehicle. He states the personal use of his truck is 10%. The full amount claimed for capital cost allowance is not necessary for the replacement of the vehicle. This along with significant personal use of the vehicle makes it reasonable to add back 50% of the capital cost allowance claimed in each of the years in question. 5) The mother has asked that the Court add back to the father's personal income the amounts claimed in the partnership and then allocated to the individual partners. The father's income tax return includes personal farm component which consists of much smaller income and expense statement on matters that are totally within his control and for which all benefits accrue to him. His tax return also includes the partnership statement which shows the same types of income and expenses but on partnership basis. There are five partners involved, two are his brothers and the other two are his cousins. There is no evidence to suggest that the income statements of the partnership are fashioned in such way to reflect an inaccurate picture on cash basis of the operation of the farm partnership. There is nothing to suggest that the partnership is organizing its expenses or distribution to artificially lower the income of the father. This is not situation where the father is the sole shareholder in corporation. This is not situation in which there is majority ownership in the partnership which would allow the father to control the activities of income distribution or asset purchase. There is nothing in the Guidelines to suggest that the Court should be adding back any of the partnership amounts to the income of the father automatically. There is nothing in the evidence that would lead the Court to the conclusion capital cost allowance being claimed by partnership is inappropriate or indeed that any of the expenses or accounting functions used by the partnership do not reflect the partnership business over the long term. The Court was not prepared to add back to the income of the father the personal expenses claimed in partnership returns as farm expenses, capital cost allowance on real property or personal property owned by the partnership. 6) The total income averaged over 3 years comes to $29,983 each year. Child maintenance shall be paid on that amount.",e_2006skqb446.txt,"Division of the matrimonial property is at issue.

"FIAT. The defendant was in contempt of court orders requiring him to account to the plaintiff for her trust funds. A trustee was appointed, and the files of Bawolin were seized. Then an accountant prepared a forensic audit. All of this was very expensive. HELD: 1)The defendant was ordered to pay the solicitor/client costs taxed. Even if Siemens was substantially unsuccessful at trial in her allegations of wrongdoing by Bawol, he ought to pay these costs because he caused the expense of the pre-trial production by his stalling tactics. 2)This was the more appropriate route. When all the evidence was in, it may transpire that Siemens is in fact, indebted to Bawolina as he now says, at the time of the contempt. Such a turn of events would not excuse his disobedience of the court orders, but it might influence the trial judge on the matter of costs. 3)The judge ordered the defendant to pay solicitor/custodial costs taxed forthwith.

The applicants have been serving their 'life' or 'indeterminate' sentences at the Penitentiary and Sinobert has remained assessed as minimum security offender and has continued to be housed at minimum security Riverbender Institution. The Court assumes that neither of the applicants' situations have changed for the purpose of rendering this decision. Habeas corpus cannot be used to review the decision of the Correctional Services of Canada declining a housing reassignment request or the policy that all inmates found in their own will be subject to disciplinary charges. The true character of the remedies being sought by them is a writ of certioraris, prohibition or mandamus. These remedies fall within the exclusive jurisdiction of the Federal Court of Canada through a judicial review process.

"The parties entered into a separation agreement for the purpose of increasing the maintenance provision and retaining the asset division. The husband argued that the agreement was unconscionable, harsh and fraudulent and that it required an order varying the terms of the agreement as they were a separate action. The maintenance provision, if it is enforceable, was to be set aside based on the position of the wife under duress or undue influence of her husband or alternatively that the maintenance award was of such a low amount that it is unconsceivable to bind the wife to such a provision.","In this divorce action the petitioner sought to have a separation agreement entered into by the parties incorporated into the corollary relief judgment.

"The applicant sought to vary the child support terms of the Corollary Relief Judgment. The parties had an agreement that they would share joint custody of their two children, with the primary responsibility being to pay child support based on the difference between what the husband would have paid to the wife and her income and a decline in her income. The former wife operated her own business and earned negligible income. She asked the court to vary because of the significant discrepancies between their income and their shared custody arrangement. The applicant argued that her RRSP income should not be considered when calculating child support as her contribution to the children's support was modest and there was no reason to decrease the amount. She sought to have the respondent pay more in child support, including spousal support, but also to review the amount of child support paid. The respondent agreed to pay $1,000 per month based on his net income of $145,344.31. In 2006, his net child support payment to her should increase for a number of reasons including his income increased, that his contribution to child support should decrease due to her increased income, that she has no other income for child support purposes, and that she asked the Court to review his support payments. The previous variation order was a consent order. Both parties agreed to its terms and both parties had legal advice prior to agreeing to it. The order was approved by the Court and was not appealed. There were however changes of circumstances since the granting of the last order. The monthly amount of support was therefore increased and the former wife requested that the respondent be ordered to pay any deficiency between what he did pay and what he should have paid. HELD: The application was dismissed with costs to the Court in any amount greater than $28,000. 1) The respondent's contributions to children's financial support are modest. There is no reason for the Court not to consider the respondent's income in line 150 as it is a recurring income figure over the past four years, including 2008. 2) The Court is not prepared to retroactively vary the terms of this order or the last variation order effective on any date before the date of that order.","The corollary relief judgment provided that the parties would share parenting of their two children approximately equally. Child support would be based on the difference between what each party would otherwise have paid if the shared custody arrangement had not been in effect. The wife now applied to have the amount paid by the husband increased due to his increase in income and a decline in her income. Following the divorce, the wife had opened her own business which only produced negligible income and in each of the past four years, she had withdrawn between $10,000 and $14,000 from her RRSP, which amounts she argued should be not considered when calculating her contribution to the children's support. She also sought to have the court go back to when the parties first separated to have the husband pay any deficiency which the court might find.

The fact that the accused was prohibited from obtaining a fishing licence at the relevant times and from applying for or obtaining a licence by mistake did not disqualify him from applying.

"The mother applied to vary the father's maintenance for her daughters, Nicole and Kirsti, in January 2007. She also applied for determination that the father was in arrears of maintenance and that he provide to her years of retroactive child support. The father in turn applied for variation of the maintenance in September 2006. HELD: Appeal allowed. 1) The mother's poor treatment and disdain of the father and his finding that the daughters did not wish to maintain a meaningful relationship with him misapprehends the evidence respecting the historical and ongoing nature of their relationship. The fact that the emphasis of the relationship after 2003 shifted does not imply that they had no meaningful relationship in their own way. The quality of the parent/child relationship rarely stands alone as the sole ground for denying support unless the situation is extremely grave. Even if the circumstances as a whole were construed as a unilateral withdrawal by the daughters, the high threshold for a finding that it disentitles the daughters to maintenance has been set at 1). 2) The father was found to have paid child support in the amount of $3,644.00 per month for two years. The daughter's response to the father by September 2006 was that she had withdrawn from the charge of parent. She did not reply to his subsequent e-mails or phone calls. 3) There was no agreement in 1997 between the parties to pay specified or other maintenance. There was a period of relatively consistent contact between the father, the daughter and the father. The mother was unable to provide for herself or withdraw herself from the responsibility of caring for the daughters. The evidence did not show that she unilaterally withdrew from the relationship with her father. She nevertheless made an attempt thereafter to reconnect without asking for money.","The issues on appeal are whether the parties' children, who were over the age of 18, had withdrawn from the father's charge and were no longer children of the marriage within the meaning of the Divorce Act and therefore disentitled to maintenance after September 2006 when they attended post-secondary education and whether the maintenance paid in the past by the father was sufficient and appropriate. HELD: Appeal allowed. The trial judge made no palpable and overriding error in his finding that the father was not in arrears of maintenance and that there would be no order for retroactive child support. Nevertheless, the trial judge was in error in determining that the children were no longer children of the marriage within the meaning of the Act. The matter is remitted to the trial judge to determine the extent to which the father is obligated to pay maintenance for the children after September 2006.  1) The father and daughters did not have a conventional relationship. The father separated from the mother and daughters early and, since he lived in Hong Kong, could only have a long-distance relationship. The relationship deteriorated in 2006. It would be accurate to describe the daughters as treating their father with disdain. However, this does not necessarily mean that the daughters had withdrawn from the relationship with the father unilaterally. The father could have stayed in contact with the daughters despite the litigation and their failure to provide him with academic records. The father's efforts to contact the daughters were no greater than the daughters' to contact him. The father recognized the financial dependency of the daughters. Their dependency did not end because of the lack of communication. 2) The trial judge placed too much emphasis on the daughters' poor treatment and disdain of the father. His finding that the daughters did not wish to maintain a meaningful relationship with the father misapprehends the evidence respecting the historical and ongoing nature of their relationship. The fact that the emphasis of the relationship after 2003 shifted does not imply that they had no meaningful relationship in their own way. The proper conclusion to be drawn from all the evidence of the relationship before September 2006 and the relative silence after that time is that father and daughters were fighting and this mutual fight was prolonged and sustained by the litigation and the intervention of the mother. This does not mean that they had withdrawn from the relationship with him unilaterally. The high threshold for a finding that it disentitles the daughters to maintenance has not been met.",b_2009skca133.txt,"The issues on appeal are whether the parties' children, who were over the age of 18, had withdrawn from the father's charge and were no longer children of the marriage within the meaning of the Divorce Act and therefore disentitled to maintenance after September 2006 when they attended post-secondary education and whether the maintenance paid in the past by the father was sufficient and appropriate.

"Reliable Truck Trailer Inc. is a mobile vehicle and associated equipment repair company situated in Pense, Saskatchewan. In 2015 it entered into an oral agreement with Super Save, Inc., hereafter referred to as 'Super Save', in which it agreed to provide, on 'call out', repair services for Super Save. In the relationship, the defendant paid Reliable's invoices as they were presented, but ceased to pay as they became due. Reliable was not prepared to accept the lesser amount and it now brings this action to recover the amount that it says is due. HELD: A fair and reasonable price to be paid for the goods and services provided by the plaintiff to the defendant. 1) In businesses such as the plaintiff's, the industry anticipates that either travel time to and from the work location is regularly billed and paid for, or alternatively, that minimum period of time is charged to its detriment. The defendant properly points out that this trial had to be adjourned on one occasion because the plaintiff had not adequately prepared, and that it has therefore incurred the cost of having his expert attend not once but twice. 2) The plaintiff has received some but not nearly all of the money that was sought, but the defendant has been successful in reducing the amount of money sought. The plaintiff asks that the court grant it out of pocket expenses that it incurred in having to retain an expert to give evidence on the issue of a fair and reasonably price for goods. 3) There is no evidence of detriment reliance. The law demands, that in the absence of an express term in a contract, or an implied term that the parties agreed to charge a fair or reasonable price for those goods and/or services, the parties agree to charge and pay a fair/reasonable price. There is only an assertion which has been denied by the defendant."" 4) It is clear that prior to November of 2015 the parties did not take issue with the invoicing. Some of the parties have given evidence that this is precisely because the defendant thought the prices were within the confines of the agreement that it signed off on. The Court cannot attribute the discounted price to the plaintiff.

"This was an application for an order setting aside a default judgment entered against the defendant municipality in February 1996. The plaintiff had filed an affidavit claiming that a mudslide had occurred during road work which had caused extensive damage to her property. The defendant had hired an insurance adjuster to do the work and had received no notice of intention to proceed. When the default judgment was entered into, the plaintiff applied to set aside the judgment on the basis that it was issued by the Prothonotary and not by the court. The applicant submitted that there was a fairly arguable defence and a reasonable excuse for not filing the defence. Application granted; the defendant had 90 days to file its defence. Although the Court could order otherwise, find the position of the defendant met the test for the Court to strike the default judgement under the provisions of Civil Procedure Rule 12.06; and find the defendant did not have the jurisdiction to sign the order for default judgment. The default judgment should be set aside based on Rule 3.04 and the plaintiff was entitled to her costs of obtaining the default.","This was an application by the defendants to set aside a default judgment entered against them by the plaintiff. Although a statement of claim was served on the defendant, it's insurer was advised by the plaintiff's counsel that she would not proceed to judgment except on 10 days written notice. More than six months later plaintiff's counsel sent a letter to the defendant's insurer giving 10 days notice.

"The bankrupt applied for his discharge from bankruptcy under s.172(2) of the Bankruptcy and Insolvency Act. His assets were $171,255 (mostly exempt or encumbered) against unsecured debts totalling $433,750 and secured debt of $150,000. His statement of affairs showed that he had $50,000 in assets at the time of his assignment, but that amount was reduced to $8,000 as a result of the combined forces of drought and BSE. The bankrupt argued that he purchased cattle for $1,000 per head prior to bankruptcy but could only sell them at his expense. He alleged that he sold cattle post-bankruptcy to save his farm. SCU brought an application to compel the bankrupt to consent to judgment on s.173(1)(a) and sought payment of the cost award of $12,000 coupled with a conditional order of consent of half of their judgment. The bankruptcy judge did not report on this ground and the bankrupt's demeanour was much the same as that of a bankrupt. HELD: The bankrupt's discharge was granted conditional upon payment of $10,250 composed of $2,250 for surplus income and a further $800 for payment to his estate for the benefit of his creditors. The Court found that this ground had been met and that the bankrupt should be able to comply with it within three years which is considered an acceptable period of time for a bankrupt to be burdened with such a condition. There was no question that his assets were less than.50 cents on the dollar when he commenced farming in 2001 and they had increased over the years. This ground was substantiated by SCU's expert evidence that showed the bankrupt was prone to errors in law and had made poor decisions in his farming operation but had made the right decisions in the right circumstances.","The Bankrupt applies for his discharge from bankruptcy. The discharge is opposed by the Credit Union and the trustee. The Bankrupt was a cattle farmer. He financed this undertaking principally through the Credit Union.

He should be able to comply with this order within 3 years.  1) The bankrupt is 42 years old and a first time bankrupt.

"This was an appeal from a Queen's Bench decision allowing this appeal and setting aside the order of the Chambers judge on the basis that he acted without any evidence that certain activities of the children were extraordinary expenses within the meaning of the Federal Child Support Guidelines and that he failed to consider and apply the definition of'special and extraordinary expenses' in s. 7(1.1) of the Guidelines. HELD: Appeal dismissed.  1) It is implicit in the conclusion that he found that approximately one-half of the appellant's extracurricular activities were found to be extraordinary. He also addressed the question of the respondent's income and the cost of Tae Kwon Do for which there was no evidence at all.  2) The chambers judge had the necessary evidence before him that he is required to consider to make his decision whether all, some, or none of the expenses are extraordinary. The expenses are covered by the basic child support order of $2,532 per year, which the respondent receives tax free. There is no basis to interfere with the decision of the Chamber judge.","This appeal was brought on a narrow ground from a judgment in the Court of Queen's Bench granting variation of a child support order pursuant to s. 17(1) of the Divorce Act. The appeal challenged the chambers judge's interpretation and application of s. 7(1.1) of the Federal Child Support Guidelines, which defines the term 'extraordinary expenses.' The appellant argued that the chambers judge erred in ordering the appellant to contribute proportionately to the costs associated with the children's extracurricular activities without finding that these were 'extraordinary expenses' within the meaning of the Guidelines. The appellant argued these expenses were ordinary and not extraordinary within the meaning of s. 7(1)(d) and (f) and s. 7(1.1) of the Guidelines. It was the appellant's position that these expenses were covered by the basic child support order which the respondent received tax free, in addition to the appellant's responsibility for 73% of the children's health care and day care expenses. HELD: Appeal dismissed with costs to the respondent. Per Hunter J.A. (Gerwing J.A. concurring): All the information needed to determine the s. 7(1)(f) expenses eligible for proportionate sharing was before the Chambers judge: he knew the total income of the recipient spouse; he knew the previous extracurricular activities and the 11 current extracurricular activities that the children participated in, along with the estimated annual cost. Updated financial statements were filed by both the appellant and respondent. The Chambers judge exercised his discretion and granted an order requiring the appellant to pay his proportionate share (73%) of the extracurricular activities he listed, which is approximately one-half of the children's extracurricular activities. Accordingly, he did not make a palpable and overriding error, nor did he err in law, and his conclusion is supported by the evidence before him on this application. There is no basis to interfere with the decision of the Chambers judge. Per Smith J.A. (in dissent): Significant deference must be given by this Court to the chambers judge in relation to child support orders. This is particularly so to the extent that such orders involve the exercise of discretion. In this case the trial judge erred in law in failing to consider and apply the definition of 'special or extraordinary expenses' in s. 7(1.1) of the Guidelines. First, it is impossible without some evidence, explanation or explicit finding, to understand why even the total of all the children's extracurricular activities would be considered 'extraordinary' in the statutory sense, given the level of child support ordered and the respondent's annual income. There was simply no evidence to support such conclusion. Second, the order did not, in fact, come close to ordering that the appellant pay proportion of half the activities, since it excluded the cost of music lessons for the two older children. In addition, it included the cost of Tae Kwon Do for which there was no evidence at all. In short, such an interpretation lacks any rational basis. Third, it is clear that, up until the argument on the appeal, the parties themselves had interpreted the order more generally, as an order that the appellant pay proportion of all the children's extra-curricular activities. This interpretation certainly makes more sense, for the alternative would require variation in the order, or new agreement, every time the children changed or added activities. It is unlikely that the chambers judge would have confined his order so specifically, absent, of course, an agreement of the parties, or reasonable finding that specific activity constituted an extraordinary expense. The chambers judge erred in failing to consider the definition of extraordinary expenses in s. 7(1.1), or this Court's decision in Ryba v. Schoenroth, and acted without any evidence that the expenses in question constituted extraordinary expenses within the meaning of the Guidelines. Accordingly, the appeal is allowed and the order of the chambers judge that the appellant pay proportion of the children's extracurricular activities is set aside. The appellant should have the costs of the appeal.",e_2008skca94.txt,"This appeal was brought on a narrow ground from a judgment in the Court of Queen's Bench granting variation of a child support order pursuant to s. 17(1) of the Divorce Act.

"The Saskatchewan Labour Relations Board awarded a wage increase to employees of Four Star Management Ltd., operators of certain food services at the University of Saskatchewan. The wage increase was part of first collective bargaining agreement concluded by the Board after the normal bargaining between the parties had failed. The employer had advised the Board that it was not prepared to make the agreement retroactive. HELD: The motion was dismissed. 1)The Board's decision to favour the union and make the wage increases fully retroactive was patently unreasonable. 2)It would be unsound to base entitlement to retroactive benefits on the serendipitous signing of a collective agreement or the signing of Board decision imposing one. The Board did not have the luxury of hindsight or the opportunity to look back and see if there was a pattern. 3)The test of'substantial compliance' would have to be considered in the context of the employer's claim to jurisdiction (Interpretation and Analysis); whether the board breached natural justice or procedural fairness by awarding retroactive wages; whether the employer obeyed its contractual obligation and failed to comply with its statutory provisions. 4)The employer was a merchant. His products were presumably priced in such a way as to reflect in part the labour costs involved in delivering them to the public. The importance of a wage rise, retroactive, would seem to be of sufficient import to justify a finding of breach of natural justice. The decision to allow the graduated employees to receive their back pay was not patently unreasonably late.","A motion for judicial review of a Labour Relations Board decision awarding a retroactive wage increase to employees. The food services operators, alleging a denial of natural justice and procedural fairness, sought to have the orders set aside on the grounds the decisions were patently unreasonable in that the employer could not afford the wage increases and because retroactivity would not have been a feature of a replicated contract. HELD: The motion was dismissed.  1)In undertaking to replicate a collective bargaining agreement that the parties might have reached, the LRB concluded the contract in 14 months by which time the two year term contract had only three and one-half months to go. The two year contract has now expired and the business has been sold. To elevate this issue to a point where a rehearing would be required would seem counterproductive. 2)The LRB's actions fell well short of substantial compliance with the 45 day limit for review. However at no time was the 'over 45 days' issue raised in the proceedings before the Board. The test of 'substantial compliance' would involve a consideration of the purpose of the 45 day time limit and the probability of prejudice which might arise from a failure to comply. The importance of a retroactive wage increase, which was substantial if viewed as a percentage, would seem prejudicial, even accepting the 45 day limit is directory. The employer sought and obtained an adjournment of the hearing in April which effectively made compliance with the 45 day limit impossible as the employees left once they graduated from their university courses. 3)The errors were not so severe or so obvious as to meet the standard of patently unreasonable as defined by the courts (ie. clearly irrational (Federal Court of Appeal), outrageous, absurd, ridiculous, so beyond the bound of reason as to amount to fraud on the law or deliberate refusal to comply with it (Southam)). 4)The decision to allow employees, who had graduated and left their employment to receive back pay, was not of sufficient import to justify a finding of breach of natural justice. Whether the Board breached natural justice and procedural fairness by awarding retroactive wages depends on whether the issue was one of the points of dispute between the parties. To set aside the entire process because the retroactivity issue was not front and centre in the preliminary discussions would seem contrary to reason and curial deference.

"The appellant appeals the calculation of his income replacement benefit made by the respondent, SGI, as provided by Part VIII of the Automobile Accident Insurance Act. Under s. 198 of the Act, a hearing was held to determine certain facts. The parties agree that the appellant is defined by the Act as a non-earner who was involved in a motor vehicle accident in July 1998 and suffered injuries to an extent that he is not able to carry on gainful employment as skidder operator. HELD: The appellant is entitled to solicitor-client costs. 1) The Act provides for calculation of IRB for the first 180 days and for the 181st and subsequent days. 2) The appellant's earning reality was working for employment income no more than half the time. Working for CLC Logging Ltd. amounted to wage rate of $16 per hour for a six-week period averaging 34.25 hours. The average work week was 34.75 hours. 3) SGI submits that the weighted average approach in calculating the IRB set the respondent's gross yearly employment income at the time of the accident is much lower than that used for employment insurance benefits. The ratio in Dietner is not relevant. Section 117 and the corresponding regulations provide the mathematical formula to determine Montgrand's IRB and the GYEI from which it is derived. 4) The issue is determining the time that Montgrand would have actually been employed and that finding has been made.","The appellant appeals the calculation of his income replacement benefit made by the respondent, SGI, as provided by Part VIII of The Automobile Accident Insurance Act.

"The issue for the Court was whether Tristen was a child of the marriage as defined by the Divorce Act (and, if so, what his obligation to pay child support should be). The parties married in 2001 and separated in 2008. The parenting and support issues concerning the biological child have been resolved. The respondent has a child, who is the biological son of the petitioner. The petitioner asserts that the respondent does not'stand in the place of a parent' when this decision was made. HELD: The Court held that the threshold for parental status finding is high and reserved for these cases where a step-parent can be clearly shown to have assumed the role of the natural parent in a substantial substitution for that of a natural parent. The Court found that this case was different because the respondent lived in a very short marriage, and although the respondent's parents had a relationship, they did not have a relationship with the child as long as the child was with the respondent. This is an appropriate case for an award of child support in the amount of $26,000.","The divorcing parties disagreed about whether the wife's son from a previous relationship (now 13) was a 'child of the marriage.' While they lived together for seven years and had one child together, they were married for less than a year. The wife alleged the husband had stood in the place of a parent to the child. She claimed this was evidenced by the fact that: he started acting like a dad before the parties lived together (when the child was two); he was involved in things like medical appointments and school activities; the child's biological father only recently became involved; and they had discussed adoption early in the relationship. The evidence showed the decision to allow the child's biological father to assume an increasing role in his life was made solely by the wife. The child no longer had contact with the husband. The child is not a 'child of the marriage.' The husband did not stand in the place of a parent to him. He was a big part of the child's life but his role was mostly incidental to the relationship with the wife and a normal part of living with a child. The marriage was short and the father's parenting role was diminished before the marriage (by the mother's choice to allow the biological father back into the child's life, and the parties' failure to pursue the idea of adoption that was raised early on).

"The issue of child support was adjourned sine die with an order that the parties provide copies of his tax returns, his notices of assessment for 1999 and 2001 and his contact information for 1999. The parties have been unable to reach an agreement regarding child support and accordingly have proceeded to trial. The issues before the Court are: 1) child support including s. 7 expenses; s. 8 expenses; whether the child support order should be retroactive. 2) costs. The main issues related to the s. expenses and the retroactivity of the support order were mixed. The petitioner asked to pay $1,500 as support for his daughter, [N.G.K.B.] born January 13, 1998; the sum of $293 per month commencing October 1, 2002 and continuing on the first day of each and every month thereafter so long as she remains a child within the meaning of The Family Maintenance Act, 1997. The issue of ongoing support was not an issue; the petitioner's income for child support purposes was $35,269.44; although she has no independent needs, there was no prior spending pattern for this Court to consider.","All of the parties agreed on February 4, 2002 that the mother and grandmother would have joint custody of the 4 year old. The father was granted reasonable access on reasonable notice. The issue of child support was adjourned sine die with an order that the father provide copies of his income tax returns for the past 3 years. Issues were whether child support should be retroactive; s.7 expenses; costs. HELD: 1)The father was to pay ongoing monthly child support of $293 for so long as the child remains a child within the meaning of the Family Maintenance Act. 2)He was to pay retroactive child support of $1,500 in monthly installments of $100. There must be some justification for retroactive support orders. This Court followed the approach taken by BC Court of Appeal in L.S. v. E.P., which set out the factors a court should consider in granting retroactive child support. He should have paid $335 in 2000; $324 in 2001; $293 in 2002. It was not clear why the petitioner did not seek financial disclosure through the Court. 3)The father was to pay his 59% share of the costs of the music program, gymnastics, swimming and craft camp within 10 days of receiving receipts. There was no prior spending pattern for the court to consider, as the child had no independent needs and was only 3 months old when the parents separated. While illness can qualify as a legitimate reason for requiring child care, the illness must relate to the child's custodian, not to a third party. The preschool expense was reasonable in relation to the total means of the three parties. The $20 kindergarten enrollment expense did not qualify as extraordinary. Retroactive s.7 expenses were not warranted. 4)There was no order for costs as results were mixed.",5_2002skqb378.txt,"The issue of child support was adjourned sine die with an order that the father provide copies of his income tax returns for the past 3 years.

"FIAT. The Receiver for theRegistered Owner applied for a vesting order under the Bankruptcy and Insolvency Act to register title in favour of the proposed purchaser of the property. Neither HSBC nor the applicant trustee proceeded with foreclosure proceedings against the property in question. Based upon the submissions from counsel, the court was satisfied that the jurisdiction formerly granted to the Court by s. 87 of the Land Titles Act, 1978, c. L-5.1 was not brought forward by the new land Titles Conversion Facilitation Regulations, 2000 combined with ss. 12 and 65 of The Queen's Bench Act, 1998 and in particular Regulation 6.5 dealing with vesting orders. HELD: The application was granted. The form of the draft order filed with the applicant solicitor's subsequent submissions was issueable.  1) The jurisdiction was determined by the Court of Appeal in the Clarkson case to be appropriate based upon the provisions of the Act that encumbranced competing creditors, competing creditors and the Registered Owner's rights respecting redemption or preservation of equity (there was none) were adversely affected if the order were granted. 2) The Court raised the concerns raised regarding the mortgagee, HSBC Bank's indebtedness secured by its mortgage far exceeds the purchase price of the house. The onus is on the applicant to prove to the court that all such parties have been served. Notice of this application was served upon counsel for the registered owner and no opposition on its part has been taken to this application. 3) The application for the vesting ordered applied for is granted.  4) Based on the submissions now received, the Court is satisfied the jurisdiction was satisfied by the application.

"The parties were married in 1986 and separated in 1995. The primary issue between the parties is custody of their four children. Ancillary to and dependent upon the determination of the custody issue, is the quantum of child support that will be payable by either party. Matrimonial property owned by the parties at the time of separation has largely been divided between them to their mutual satisfaction. However, in making an order for custody pursuant to the Divorce Act, the court must take into consideration only the best interests of the children as determined by reference to the condition, means, needs and other circumstances of those children. HELD: The children were in the joint custody of the parties and they resided an equal amount of time in each home, alternating every two weeks. 1) The uncontradicted evidence indicated that the most important consideration for these children is stability. That stability is found in their father's home. The children are bonded to their mother. 2) There was no evidence of the increased costs of shared custody such that consideration could be given to s. 9(b) of the Guidelines. It is in their best interests that they be removed from an environment that offers them the stability that they require nor from the specialized educational opportunities available to them in Saskatoon.","The primary issue was custody of the four children and dependent upon that determination, the quantum of child support. Matrimonial property owned at the time of separation in 1995 had been divided except for a pension and RSP. The parties agreed to joint custody in 1996 in an interim separation agreement and the father would pay support of $693.80 per month.HELD: 1)The evidence demonstrated a breakdown of the marriage as established by s.8(2)(a) of the Divorce Act. 2)Joint custody was ordered such that the children would reside an equal amount of time in each home, alternating every two weeks. The most important consideration was stability which was to be found in the father's home. Only the best interests of the children must be taken into consideration as determined by the condition, means, needs and other circumstances of the children. 3)The child support payable by the father was reduced by 30 percent. The table amount for four children based on the father's income of $45,900 was $962 per month. The mother's income was below the level at which any support would be payable. Where there is a significant disparity in incomes, a straight set off as suggested in Hubic and Mertler may not be appropriate in all cases. It failed to take into account the father's more modest means and ability to pay the full table amount as well as support for four childen in his care 50 percent of the time. The shared custody arrangement which fell within s.9 of the Federal Child Support Guidelines, did not necessarily lead to a reduction in the amount payable. There was no evidence of increased costs. 4)The parties agreed the registered retirement savings plan and employment pension should be divided equally after liabilities were paid. 5)No costs.",2_1999canlii12455.txt,"The primary issue was custody of the four children and dependent upon that determination, the quantum of child support. 2)Joint custody was ordered such that the children would reside an equal amount of time in each home, alternating every two weeks.

"The accused was charged with failing to ensure the health and safety of its employee, who was engulfed in grain in a receiving pit, when the incident occurred. The employee died at the scene. Viterra is charged with the same offences under the Canada Labour Code. The same employee who died in the receiving pit was also charged under the same provisions of the Canada Occupational Health and Safety Regulations. The Court of Appeal declined to accept the Crown's position that proof of a worker injury or death necessarily proves the actus reus of failing to prevent the health or safety of an employee. HELD: ViterRA is charged under s. 124 of the Code with failing, failing or failing to make the required safety procedures aware. 1) The Court found that the employee did not adequately supervise or take appropriate steps to ensure his health and well-being. The officer testified that he was not instructed to do so. The facts were so numerous that it was impossible to tell for sure whether he had adequately instructed the employee on how to unplug the pit or not. 2) The mass of material emphasized the dangers, and the importance of following the safety procedures rather than burying them. The fact that the witness suffered serious injury is evidence that the appellant did not ensure his safety. Not everything that he related can be accurate and have no way of knowing which parts are accurate and which parts aren't. Consequently, cannot and do not rely on the evidence of the witness.","HELD: The court did not accept the Crown’s position that proof of a worker injury or death necessarily proved the actus reus of failing to ensure the health and safety of an employee. The deceased witness’s evidence was not relied upon by the court due to inconsistencies. The assistant manager’s evidence also had some inconsistencies but overall his oral testifying was found to be in a frank and honest manner. The court accepted the assistant manager’s evidence that he would not have told the employee or anyone to go down into the pit to clear a blockage, because it is not possible to clear such a blockage from inside the pit. The Crown argued that, in any event, the court should infer that because the employee entered the pit, the respondent did not adequately instruct, train, supervise and inform him. The court found that the mass of training material emphasized the dangers and the importance of following the safety procedures. The information was not buried in a mass of other information as suggested by the Crown. The court found that the information, training, instruction and supervision was sufficient, if adhered to, to ensure the health and safety of the employee, generally. The Crown argued that a culture of paying lip service to safety had developed at the respondent’s place of business. The court held that, despite some lapses in safety, overall there was a culture of safety. The court also held that the respondent did not instruct the employee to unplug a blockage in the pit and, therefore, did not have an obligation to instruct him on how to perform that task. The respondent was not guilty of counts 1 and 2. The Crown also did not prove the actus reus of counts 3 and 4. The Crown failed to prove that the respondent did not adequately train and supervise the employee with respect to responding to a blockage by looking into the receiving pit to see if it was full of grain. The court also concluded that the respondent had made the employee aware of the hazard of being engulfed in grain in a receiving pit and, therefore, the actus reus of counts 5 and 6 were not proved.

"The defendant moved for summary judgment, dismissing the claims made by two of the plaintiffs, Steven and Jody Johansson, who were injured in a single vehicle accident while passengers in a vehicle driven by the other plaintiff, Maria Johansson. Both were paid damages for the injuries they sustained. Both signed releases acknowledging full and final settlement of any claims arising from the accident. The motor vehicle accident occurred in October 1998 and both Johansson and Johansson were paid for their injuries as result of the releases given to Citadel General Assurance Company (Citadel). Both parties brought a Statement of Claim on behalf of all three plaintiffs alleging that the motor Vehicle Accident was caused by an inherent defect in the design and manufacture of the vehicle. The vehicle, 1997 Chevrolet Lumina, was manufactured by GMCL. The plaintiffs now claim damages for their injury, which they allege is caused by the careless and negligent actions of GMCL in the manufacture of this vehicle. To allow their action to proceed would be an abuse of this Court's process.","The plaintiffs, Steven and Jody Johansson, were injured in a single vehicle crash while driving with the plaintiff, Mary Johansson.

FIAT. The applicants sought an order prohibiting the respondent from holding a public hearing with respect to a proposed hotel development in the community facility known as the Evergreen Centre and from giving third reading to and adopting a Bylaw 756/99. The proposed hotel would be connected to the EverGreen Centre by a public walkway and would be free of charge to all visitors. The applicant argued that the proceedings in respect to the proposed hotel were invalid by reason of bad faith and that the respondent had failed to meet the statutory prerequisites for a public meeting. HELD: The application was granted in part. The respondents were granted an order restraining the respondent: a) from holding any public hearing; b) from giving a third reading; and c) from considering an application for a discretionary use permit by the applicant. The requested relief should be granted in full.  1)The applicants were hoteliers who operate five of the six hotels and motels within the community and who have joined together in an informal association; and 2) were hotelier vendors. They were to meet with the Town Council and have a private meeting.  3) The applicants were to have a public discussion with the council. 4) The applicant was to have an in camera meeting with Town Council.,"In issue was whether the Town Council's proceedings in respect to a proposed hotel development, including the bylaw, were invalid by reason of bad faith and whether it met the statutory prerequisites for a public meeting. HELD: The Town was prohibited from holding a public hearing with respect to the amendment to the zoning bylaw and from giving third reading to and adopting the bylaw. The application was dismissed in respect to the application for a discretionary use for a hotel development by the Palidwars. 1)The Town Council had acted openly and with candor. It did not have a duty to inform the applicants of the proposal because they were involved in the hotel industry. There was nothing improper about the initial confidentiality of the proposal and meetings in camera. 2)The shareholders' private interests were not being advanced rather than the community's best interest. Section 91(2) of the Urban Municipality Act and Harker v. Regina were noted. 3)There was nothing erroneous or improper in the method used to determine the selling price. 4)The question of the sale was still open. The Town was not subject to an unconditional commitment. The court could not intervene as it had not been established that the Town Council had fettered its discretion. 5)The process as a whole was tainted and should be set aside. The mayor and alderman, both shareholders and directors of the corporation, fell within the definition of partnership. They both had a pecuniary interest in the proposal within the meaning of the legislation. No finding was made that they acted with a dishonest or wrongful intent.

"The appellant sought a declaration to strike the appellant's claim under s. 36 of the Constitution Act. The chambers judge struck the claim as disclosing no reasonable cause of action. The appellant appealed. Appeal and cross-appeal dismissed; the court found that, in the context of this appeal, the claim should be struck only if they appear to be absolutely unsustainable or certain to fail; the proposed interpretation offered by the appellant was simply too vague. The court found: 1)The appellant had failed to demonstrate a justiciable commitment on the part of the federal government and the provinces; and 2)It was clear the motion to strike was not taken lightly. The Chambers judge did not answer the question of whether or not Apotex's proposed interpretation was 'worth considering' or whether it had a chance of success; nor did the Attorney General reach her own conclusion on the disputed point of statutory interpretation. That is an error on her part.","The municipality appealed the trial court's decision to summarily strike their claim against the province, pursuant to R14.25 of the Civil Procedure Rules (1972). At trial, the municipality argued s. 36 of the Constitution Act compels the province to take appropriate steps to alleviate regional disparities. Arguing this is an enforceable obligation that was breached by the province, the municipality sought a declaration from the court to that effect. The municipality's arguments on appeal focused on the justiciability of s. 36. The province concentrated on the fact the judge had dismissed based on deficiencies in the pleadings, calling the municipality's claim too vague to succeed. Appeal dismissed. The effective standard of review is correctness - whether the judge erred in law by striking the claim. The appeal court carefully framed the issues, and examined s. 36 (its intent, and application). Rule 14.25 is a drastic remedy, and the trial judge was aware the province had a high threshold to meet in order to have the claim struck. While s. 36 might be justiciable, it does not provide an enforceable right to municipalities. Rather, it embodies an agreement among federal and provincial governments, and only those parties who were privy to the agreement can act to have it enforced.

The plaintiff broker for the defendant real estate brokerage firm applied for and was awarded a commission of 10% on the basis of selling the lots at a rate of 6% less the commission on the previous sale. The plaintiff brought an action against both the broker and the vendor for breach of contract or in the alternative claim for unjust enrichment and/or quantum meruit. The broker's lawyer was retained to represent the plaintiff. The court found that both parties were honestly in error in the issue of the oral agreement as the commission was subject to HST and in the absence of an enforceable agreement the plaintiff was entitled to recover from the defendants based upon quantum meruits or unjust enrichment. The issue was whether the agreement was enforceable.,"The plaintiff and defendant entered into an oral contract for the development and sale of land.

"HELD: The Court found the petitioner’s Federal Child Support Guidelines to be slightly in excess of $245,000 and directed that he pay interim child support for D.K. in the amount of $1,949.00 and interim spousal and child support of $5,250.00 per month. The petitioner had been residing in Regina for the past few years and claimed that shared parenting and an equal division of family home and property had been his primary motivation for moving to Canada. The respondent, he maintained, wanted him to remain in Canada but felt that, since he was self-employed, he was not able to afford it. As for the parties’ debts, the petitioner claimed that he had obtained an interest-free loan from the respondent that was used primarily to pay child care, education and travel expenses. He also claimed that the respondent was a better parent because she had taken more time off work and had been able to spend more time with him. The court found the respondent to have an income of approximately $309,700.00, which was approximately double the amount he earned in the previous two years, and attributed the increase in income to increased access by the respondent. The Court also found that there were other outstanding debts owing to the health region in Ontario, which the petitioner had not been aware of prior to the commencement of his residency in Canada. These debts were the subject of an answer and counter petition filed by the petitioner against the respondent in January 2015 against them both on the basis that they had unilaterally transferred their son to the province. HELD: 1) The respondent was granted access on the first three weekends of each month, as well as every Wednesday.  2) The Court ordered the respondent paid interim child tax benefits of $3,000 per month for the first two years. 3) The petitioner was awarded access on alternate weekends. 4) The court prohibited the respondent from removing the petitioner from the province for any length of time. 5) On a balance of probabilities, the respondent would not be able to support himself on an ongoing basis due to the nature of his practice. On balance, the court found that it would be difficult for the petitioner to continue living in the province if he was permitted to travel to visit his son in the U.S. Further, the Court found that if the respondent had continued to work and did not wish to return to the country, he would be entitled to a portion of the monies from the Ontario monies for the RQHR loan","HELD: 1) The court ordered joint custody and continued primary residence with the wife and specified access to the husband. The child’s interests were best served by a parenting regime that preserved the stability the wife provided as his primary caregiver, while expanding the periods of uninterrupted time with his father. It was best that the parties interact minimally with each other. The mother was generally contemptuous of the husband’s role as parent and sometimes restricted or denied the child’s access with him. There was no credible evidence that the child was suicidal as the mother alleged, nor did any evidence support her allegations of physical or sexual abuse. Rather, evidence confirmed that the child was smart, sometimes sensitive, but generally happy. 2) The husband had professional corporation. His income was determined from his line 150 income, as adjusted to reflect the actual dividend income he received. His income should not be augmented by dividend income equal to his corporation’s net earnings. Only current pre-tax earnings are truly surplus to corporation’s needs, without exposing it to encroachment on its capital or undermining its viability. The relevance of the wife’s income was limited to the apportionment of s. expenses. It was not appropriate to impute income to her. She was intentionally underemployed, but her decision was justified initially by the needs of her son and more recently by her own reasonable educational needs and the obligation to become qualified to practice medicine in Canada. Retroactive child support was not appropriate, except in respect of the two-month period when the wife was overseas, the husband was caring for their child and he admittedly neglected to pay child support in accordance with court order. There was considerable evidence upon which to conclude that a retroactive award would place an undue hardship upon the husband as, pursuant to the terms of this judgment, he was obliged to assume significant family debt, provide a considerable equalization payment and pay increased child and spousal support. 3) The husband retained the family home and sole responsibility for the mortgage thereon. The court ordered him to pay one half of the equity in the home to the wife. Otherwise, the parties were to retain all other items of family property in their respective possession and be solely responsible for any indebtedness in their respective names. The Family Property Act does not mandate the apportionment of debt, equal or otherwise, save to the extent that fairness requires an unequal division of family property to reflect the parties’ respective obligations. The court’s discretion to equalize the parties’ debt by an uneven division did not extend to the family home. 4) The wife was entitled to compensatory and non-compensatory spousal support. The disparity in their incomes was directly attributable to her role in the marriage and their mutual efforts to advance his career. The wife’s income consisted almost entirely of spousal support. However, the high amount of debt assumed by the husband coupled with his limited means for satisfying this judgment, warranted a departure from the range of outcomes suggested by the Spousal Support Advisory Guidelines. Given the genuine and material uncertainty as to the wife’s future need and extent to which she will achieve self-sufficiency, an indefinite award reviewable on the earlier of a date approximately one year from the trial date or the wife becoming qualified to practice medicine was appropriate. The court declined to impute income to the wife or to order retroactive spousal support. 5) Judgment for divorce was granted, with judgment to take effect on the conclusion of the appeal period.",e_2017skqb380.txt,"HELD: 1) The court ordered joint custody and continued primary residence with the wife and specified access to the husband.

There was no credible evidence that the child was suicidal as the mother alleged, nor did any evidence support her allegations of physical or sexual abuse. Rather, evidence confirmed that the child was smart, sometimes sensitive, but generally happy. Retroactive child support was not appropriate, except in respect of the two-month period when the wife was overseas, the husband was caring for their child and he admittedly neglected to pay child support in accordance with court order. There was considerable evidence upon which to conclude that a retroactive award would place an undue hardship upon the husband as, pursuant to the terms of this judgment, he was obliged to assume significant family debt, provide a considerable equalization payment and pay increased child and spousal support. 3) The husband retained the family home and sole responsibility for the mortgage thereon. The court ordered him to pay one half of the equity in the home to the wife. Otherwise, the parties were to retain all other items of family property in their respective possession and be solely responsible for any indebtedness in their respective names. The Family Property Act does not mandate the apportionment of debt, equal or otherwise, save to the extent that fairness requires an unequal division of family property to reflect the parties’ respective obligations. The court’s discretion to equalize the parties’ debt by an uneven division did not extend to the family home. 4) The wife was entitled to compensatory and non-compensatory spousal support. The disparity in their incomes was directly attributable to her role in the marriage and their mutual efforts to advance his career. The wife’s income consisted almost entirely of spousal support. However, the high amount of debt assumed by the husband coupled with his limited means for satisfying this judgment, warranted a departure from the range of outcomes suggested by the Spousal Support Advisory Guidelines. Given the genuine and material uncertainty as to the wife’s future need and extent to which she will achieve self-sufficiency, an indefinite award reviewable on the earlier of a date approximately one year from the trial date or the wife becoming qualified to practice medicine was appropriate. The court declined to impute income to the wife or to order retroactive spousal support. 5) Judgment for divorce was granted, with judgment to take effect on the conclusion of the appeal period."

"The plaintiff, Sign-O-Lite, sought damages for breach of contract for alleged negligent misrepresentation.

"This case concerns the fixture financing provisions of The Personal Property Security Act, 1993. The respondent Gari Holdings Ltd. claims damages from the appellant Langham Credit Union Ltd. The claim arises from the Credit Union's delay in removing from Gari's land a quonset in which the respondent held a security interest. The trial judge found in favour of Gari and awarded damages on the basis that the Credit union became a tenant at sufferance when it failed to remove the quonal. The Court of Appeal allowed a Cross-Appeal and dismissed the appeal. The Credit Union appealed. It argued that s. 36 of the PPSA precludes a claim by a land owner against a financer arising from the financer's failure to remove a fixture within a commercially reasonable time after giving notice of its intention. HELD: The appeal was allowed with costs to the credit union in the amount of $6,227.88 plus costs. 1)The trial judge erred in dismissing the application. The material suggests the Applicant had no use for the building and wished it removed from the outset. The building was sold to a third party in the spring of 2001. However, it was not removed. The defendant took possession of the Building and rented it out for storage. These actions reflect the terms of its lease with Lakeland. The plaintiff has established that while the building was a fixture in the Property, it is not being removed. 2)It is common ground that the defendant in this case will seek damages for unjust enrichment in the same amount as the damages determined in connection with the theft of the building. If that issue is decided in favour, it will also be necessary to consider the merits of the specific claims advanced by the plaintiff against the credit Union. If the claim is not precluded by the court, then Gari is entitled to relief.","This case concerns the fixture financing provisions of The Personal Property Security Act, 1993 (PPSA). The respondent claims damages from the appellant Credit Union. The claim arises from the Credit Union's delay in removing a Quonset in which the Credit Union held a security interest. The trial judge found in favour of the respondent and awarded damages on the basis that the Credit Union became a tenant at sufferance of the respondent when it failed to remove the Quonset and therefore was obliged to pay rent. The issue is whether the PPSA precludes a claim by a land owner against a financer arising from the financer's failure to remove a fixture within a commercially reasonable time after giving notice of its intentions in that regard. HELD: Appeal allowed. Cross appeal dismissed. In light of the causes of action pled and the evidence brought forward, the respondent's claim against the Credit Union cannot succeed.  1) Section 36 of the PPSA may speak exhaustively to the relative priorities of financers and land owners in fixtures. It does not necessarily speak in that way to the full range of rights and claims that those parties might have against each other. There is no principled basis on which a person with an interest in land should be denied meaningful relief when a financer, without excuse, acts in a commercially unreasonable manner by failing or refusing to remove a fixture after giving formal notice of its intention to do so. 2) It would have been improper for the respondent to deny permission to remove the building unless the Credit Union paid an amount in respect of the property taxes attributable to it. Allowing a person with an interest in land to oblige financers to pay property taxes before realizing on their security would amount to a substantial realignment of the careful balance between the rights of fixture financers and holders of property interest reflected in s. 36 of the PPSA. 3) The Credit Union could not have been either a tenant at sufferance or a tenant at will of the respondent for the fundamental reason that there was no landlord and tenant relationship between them. The respondent's claims in this regard fail. 4) The respondent has failed to present evidence that would allow this Court to quantify the benefit conferred on the Credit Union and to provide appropriate relief. As a consequence, no effect can be given to the unjust enrichment argument. 5) In light of the conclusion that there was no tenancy at sufferance or tenancy at will, the cross-appeal fails.",7_2005skca97.txt,"The respondent claims damages from the appellant Credit Union.

"The Crown appeals from the acquittal of the respondent on a charge of impaired driving. The Crown claims the learned trial judge erred in law in excluding two breath samples taken after the arrest of the accused on the basis that they were obtained in violation of s. 8 of the Charter. HELD: The appeal is dismissed. 1) While the trial judge was aware that an analysis of the reasonable and probable grounds (i.e. that the accused had consumed alcohol in such a quantity that the concentration in his blood exceeded 80 milligrams of alcohol in 100 millilitres of blood) was not sufficient to set aside the conviction on the impaired driving charge. 2) The officer was entitled to consider the circumstance as whole and need not prove prima facie case. The Court must consider the subjective and objective factors, such as whether the accused's driving actions were reasonable at the time of the demand, the manner in which he was asked to act and the fact that he was attempting to obtain a breath sample constituted objective evidence of impairment. 3) The accused was subject to unreasonable search and seizure pursuant to s. 253(b) and s. 255 of the Criminal Code. The observations of the arresting officer upon which the officer formed reasonable, probable and objective grounds (e.g. that he had just swished with mouthwash because he could smell mints in the air) were sufficient to establish that his blood alcohol content was in excess of.08. The breath samples were received directly into the vehicle or into an approved container or an approved instrument operated by qualified technician and showed the accused the lowest of the concentrations of alcohol on his breath.  4) Although the accused was prone to slurred speech and confusion, the officer was of the opinion that his ability to operate a motor vehicle was impaired by alcohol as shown by the reflective material on the side of the marked police cruiser. The reflective material could have been used to mask the odour of alcohol. 5) The Court cannot attribute the accused’s driving actions to anything other than being in a state of underemployment. The accused had not been drinking and was doing well in the field. 6) The U-turn, while illegal, was explained as part of the act of returning to Gerald in order to re-orient himself.","The Crown appealed the respondent's acquittal on a charge of driving over .08.

"The accused, who was convicted of conspiring with others to traffic in cocaine, applied for judicial interim release pending his appeal. In the weeks immediately before the trial, Crown counsel disclosed the existence of approximately 1,900 documents. The Crown sought to have the trial adjourned for a further day to allow proper review of the documents. During that time, defence counsel also requested that the trial be set aside and new trial ordered. HELD: The application to adjourn the trial was granted. The Court found that to allow the conviction to stand in the face of all relevant circumstances would amount to a miscarriage of justice as the accused could not demonstrate that late and non-disclosure affected his right to make full answer and defence. As the accused had disclosed the documents to defence counsel, the Court was in the same position as the trial judge and could not assess the undisclosed documents to determine whether the undisclosed information could have affected the verdict. A new trial was the only remedy available.","HELD: The appeal was allowed. The conviction was set aside and a new trial ordered.

"The plaintiff was injured in a motor vehicle accident. The defendants claimed the headlights were not in operation when it approached the intersection and that the plaintiff was contributory negligent for driving at 2:00 a.m. The accident occurred as a result of the negligence of the defendant in the operation of a Royal Canadian Mounted Police motor vehicle referred to herein as the 'police vehicle'. There are two issues with respect to liability for the accident. First, the defendants claim the beams in the defendant's vehicle were not operating at the time the accident occurred. The second issue relates to wear and tear. The defendant testified that he did not see the accident occur but that he was aware that the plaintiffs vehicle was approaching the intersection when he turned his vehicle right. The plaintiff was in near perfect condition. She said she was struck in the intersection by the police vehicle which was fifty feet behind the defendant vehicle. HELD: The plaintiff is entitled to recover damages from the defendants. 1) The evidence of the police officer convinced the court he was not qualified to express an opinion. The evidence from the plaintiff's lawyer convinced the Court that the defendant gave detailed evidence of where he was on the highway and finite details as to his speed at those locations. The Court could not accept the testimony of a witness who was looking 'about 90 degrees to his right' when he observed the vehicle in the parking lot. 2) The Court was unable to determine how close the plaintiff came to the intersection or the extent of attention she paid to it. There was no evidence that either of the parties was impaired. 3) The plaintiff's concern was focused on the officer. He did not follow some of the directions and recommendations in the Traffic Accident Investigation Manual.","The two plaintiffs were injured when the defendant police officer made a left hand turn in front of their motor vehicle at night. Although the plaintiff driver was proceeding through a green light, the defendant alleged that her vehicle's headlights were not in operation. The driver suffered soft tissue injuries to her neck and mid and lower back, blunt trauma to both knees and bruising of the right hand. She underwent physiotherapy for three months and made a complete recovery within two years except for flare-ups in the upper back. The second plaintiff suffered neck stiffness, bilateral shoulder pain and bruising to his arm and leg. He underwent successful surgery for tendonitis in both shoulders and his neck improved with physiotherapy. General damages awarded to the plaintiff driver in the amount of $12,000; general damages awarded to the second plaintiff in the amount of $25,000 (reduced by 25% due to that plaintiff's failure to wear a seat belt). The court found that even if the second plaintiff's tendonitis was not caused by the accident, it was definitely aggravated by it.

"The wife had been left in poverty by the departure of the breadwinner in whose name most of the family assets were habitually held. In many cases she was left with nowhere to live. Under the provisions of s. 22 of The Matrimonial Property Act, 1997, it was recognized that most often the young children of a broken home remain in the custody of the mother and so discretion was given to the judge to ameliorate the equal division regime which the registration imposed. HELD: The wife was awarded $1,945 plus an award of $5,000 for a total of $6,960.00. The husband was given one-half of the matrimonial home valued at $8,358.00, half of which accrues to each of the parties or $4,445.00; and the other half accrualed to a Standard Life policy during the same period in the amount of $2,200. These two items were subject to income tax so the judge applied a 30% deduction to their value, leaving $7,690.00 to be credited to him. To that number must be added the accrual to a Sun Life Policy during the period between the marriage and the application date of May 21, 1998 valued at approximately $8.358. This was an extraordinary case and the wife may have met her ordinary circumstances in order to remain in poverty. The Court accepted the claim that the wife's house, jointly owned with his mother as protection 'in case he meets someone' is exempt property. The claim was in its entirety inequitable and had he not filed a counter petition there would have been no division, no trial and no excessive legal costs because the petition made no property claims whatever.","Division of matrimonial property and the matrimonial home were in issue. The respondent claimed exemption for his own house and all of the assets he had before the marriage which lasted 21 months. HELD: The petitioner was awarded $1,945 plus costs of $5,000. The respondent's claim was inequitable in its entirety. 1)Saskatchewan precedents suggest that neither a marriage of short duration nor prior ownership of a home or inheritance or gifts by one side of the family constituted extraordinary circumstances. However, prior ownership by the petitioner and its occupancy by her children, the economic imbalance between the spouses and the brevity of the marriage combined to make this an 'extraordinary' case. The home was to remain in the petitioner's name. It was the long term family home of the petitioner and her 10 children born of a previous marriage. Five of those children still lived with her in the home. The respondent had a permanent job, the prospect of an inheritance, a pension and his own home with no mortgage. 2)Credit was given to the respondent for half of the debts assumed. One-half of the accrual to his pension and his two life insurance contracts was credited to the petitioner less a 30% deduction for income tax.

"The plaintiff was employed by Sears as driver and driver's helper for 28 years. He was dismissed from his employment in 1988 for his 'disregard of company policy related to hours of work and overtime'. The plaintiff claimed that he was entitled to a fifteen minute break for breakfast and an unpaid supper break in the afternoon. He also claimed that overtime was unjustified and demanded a reasonable excuse for his dismissal. The plaintiff was dismissed for his failure to abide by company policy. HELD: The plaintiff's dismissal was justified. The defendant had satisfied the onus on them to prove that there was a just cause for the dismissal of the plaintiff. 1)The rules must be distributed; the implications of breaking the rules in question are sufficiently serious to justify termination. 2)The implication of breaking rules was sufficiently serious for the termination of the employee. The employer must be reasonable. 3)The employees must be warned that they will be terminated if a rule is breached. The implication of break and overtime is sufficiently serious.

"The estate applied for party and party costs in relation to a claim for costs against the father who sought party and partner costs. The father sought party/party costs. He sought party & party costs. In light of the present position of the Hand and his daughter, and the determination not to order costs in favour of the father, those three parties will bear their own costs. HELD: The application was not 'estate litigation' as the father had claimed. It was litigation between two living persons about the contractual obligations of one of them. The central issue in the father's application was the meaning of his mother's will and she clearly made a gift to him that failed. However, the father and his sister were now acting on their own. The issue was not the father requiring to stand by his 1999 will, including the gift of the condominium to his son. The application wasn't estate litigation either. Alternatively, he sought party costs out of the estate.","A co-executor and beneficiary under his mother's will, Mr. Hand applied for an order confirming her gift of a one-half interest in a condo held jointly by his parents until her death. His sister and his father, Dr. Hand, successfully defeated the motion, with the court holding the gift was invalid and the condo passed solely to Dr. Hand on Mrs. Hand's death. Dr. Hand abandoned his motion for costs, but Mr. Hand sought to have his solicitor-client costs paid out of the estate.

The central issue was between Mr. Hand and his father: was Dr. Hand required to stand by his previous gift, and were the wills made by he and his wife mutual wills subject to a promise against revocation?

"HELD: The Court found the plaintiff had proven that he was defamed and accepted the defendants' defence of qualified privilege. The Court ordered that none of the parties should receive costs. The plaintiff seeks damages and costs.  1) The Court accepted the defence of the defendants in qualified privilege (that is, that they had publicly communicated the plaintiff's allegations to all members of the Union and were not trying to prevent or to prevent the harassment); 2) The plaintiff has proven that his personal and professional reputation has been seriously damaged by defamatory statements made by the defendants. However, the defendants have accepted the plaintiff' defence in qualified privileged (that they had not tried to prevent and were trying to ensure that the plaintiff was able to return to a harassment free workplace); 3) The court accepted the defendant's defence of 'unfounded and without substance' (see: 'all matters which are in accordance with the recognised and reasonable procedure of a tribunal are also absolutely privileged'. The Court held that the impugned wording was all the more troubling because the plaintiff sincerely believed that he, the person ultimately responsible for insuring a harassment-free workplace, was being sought. The words of the grievance were published in the newspaper, on the Internet, in the file cabinets of the university, in various venues and on the website of the plaintiff and his employer.","The plaintiff veterinarian states that his personal and professional reputation has been damaged by defamatory statements made by the defendants. He worked at the veterinary college at the University of Saskatchewan, and an employee was involved in a grievance process. The plaintiff was involved by virtue of his supervisory position at the college. He asserts these statements were posted on bulletin boards in the plaintiff's workplace and postings on the union website. The statements were produced in connection with the labour grievance and alleged that the plaintiff failed to prevent harassment in the workplace in supervisory capacity or engaged in such harassment himself. The plaintiff seeks damages and costs. He states that he was pushed to leave his employment and is now engaged in private practice which pays less and is not as stable. He has incurred costs to move to the United States to obtain employment.HELD: The elements of defamation are: 1) the words would tend to lower the plaintiff's reputation in the eyes of a reasonable person, 2) the words in fact referred to the plaintiff, and 3) the words were published (Grant v. Torstar Corp.). In these circumstances, the plaintiff was defamed. The defendants raise the defence of absolute privilege. This defence provides that 'no action for defamatory statements can exist where such statements are made in the course of judicial or quasi-judicial proceedings' (Getz v. Opseth). The Trade Union Act establishes mandatory arbitration for the resolution of labour grievances and empowers the arbitration board or chairperson with court-like functions and powers. The Saskatchewan Court of Appeal has found that an arbitration board fulfills quasi-judicial function (Fletcher Challenge Energy Canada Inc. v. Sulz). The Court does not allow the defence of absolute privilege as it is usually considered in the context of the actual hearing before the body. In this case, the statements were produced as a notice in order to bring further witnesses forward from the college. The Court instead determines the statements fall within the defence of qualified privilege. This applies in a situation where the statements are made in order to discharge the board member's duty. The Court finds the statements were made in order to gather further evidence and witnesses, which is part of the board's duties. The protection of qualified privilege may be removed on where there is evidence that the dominant purpose of the statements was malice. There is no such evidence in this case, therefore the defence of qualified privilege succeeds. Nonetheless the Court provides an opinion on damages on a provisional basis. There was no evidence that the plaintiff was forced to leave his position and move to the United States following the incident. The Court therefore concludes fair compensation would be $25,000. Since the results are mixed, there is no award of costs.",b_2010skqb249.txt,"The plaintiff veterinarian states that his personal and professional reputation has been damaged by defamatory statements made by the defendants.

"The appellant appeals his conviction on a charge of dangerous driving contrary to s. 249(1)(a) of the Criminal Code. HELD: The appeal is allowed. The conviction is set aside and a new trial in the Provincial Court is ordered. 1)Had the Charter issues been properly raised and argued before the learned trial judge, a conclusion different from the one reached (based solely upon the application of common law principles of voluntariness) may have resulted. 2)The trial judge erred in holding that the statements made by the appellant were not made pursuant to the Highway Traffic Act and therefore admissible in criminal proceedings.  3)Although the trial judge concluded that the appellant's statement was voluntary and admissible, the Court of Appeal was correct in finding that the statement could have been made simply because the appellant wished to have his description of the accidentpresented to the police.  4)The appellant appealed on two grounds. The first was that the provincial court reviewed the circumstances of the conviction and found it was impossible to agree with her conclusions in this respect or her statement that notwithstanding the evidence of Constable Louvel already referred to she was not aware of the reason why Mr. Chow attended at the police station and gave the information and that it was his understanding the appellant did so to give an accident report. The second ground of appeal was that she could not say that the question arose in this case as to whether or not the highway Traffic Act obligation to give a report to the Police renders any statement made during the report involuntary. The statement made by Mr.Chow was given a compulsion of statute which was not a voluntary statement and therefore ought to be ruled inadmissible. Objections to the admissibility of the accused'sstatements based upon s.7 of the Charter raise a different issueand different considerations from the Application of Common Law Principles.","An appeal of conviction on a charge of dangerous driving on the grounds the trial judge erred in holding that statements made by the appellant were not made pursuant to the Highway Traffic Act and therefore admissible in the criminal proceedings; and in holding the statements could have been made simply because the appellant wished to have his description of the accident presented to the police and therefore were voluntary and admissible.

"The accused plead guilty to a charge of dangerous driving causing death. He was driving a motor vehicle that was operating in the manner dangerous to the public contrary to s. 249(4) of the Criminal Code. HELD: The accused was sentenced to imprisonment in the community for 90 days. 1)The accused was not intoxicated at the time of the accident and had not consumed any alcohol or drugs. The accident occurred at a northerly direction and was not controlled by traffic lights. 2)The only blood alcohol level in the victim was at.180. The accused had consumed a significant quantity of alcohol and was in no shape to drive a vehicle. The impact on his passengers was devastating and he was in danger to himself and to the community. 3)Although the accused was 19 years of age and had a minor youth record, he had six speeding convictions on his highway traffic record, two of which were on his record. He had been involved in night of drinking and partying without sleep and had been consuming alcohol. The Crown suggested a sentence in the low end of the range was appropriate. 4)Although his driving was not extremely erratic or bizarre, his actions were clearly inappropriate and imprudent and his consumption of alcohol appeared to be either the major cause or contributing factor to his death.","The accused who had plead guilty to a charge of dangerous driving causing death sought a conditional sentence to be served in the community. Various witnesses gave conflicting accounts of the driving leading up to the accident and the accident itself. Two vehicles driving at a high rate of speed, one in the left lane and one in the right hand curb lane passed vehicles stopped at a cross walk, the later striking and killing a pedestrian. The vehicles had been observed pulling around other vehicles whenever possible and 'jousting' with each other. HELD: A sentence of 90 days to be served intermittently in a provincial correctional centre was imposed. Conditions of probation included restraint from the consumption of alcohol and non-prescription drugs for 24 hours prior to attendance at the centre. An 18 month probation order required him to perform 200 hours of community service and to enroll in a defensive driving course. He was prohibited from operating a motor vehicle for three years and was to pay a surcharge of $250.  1)The Saskatchewan Court of Appeal had not to date considered the question of whether it was appropriate that a sentence of imprisonment be served in the community where the offence is that of dangerous driving causing death. It has consistently endorsed sentences of incarceration for the offence of impaired driving causing death. Alternatives to incarceration were rejected as not adequately reflecting the gravity of the offence and as not serving to deter either the offender or the general public from committing like offences. 2)The driver's lack of attention together with excessive speed caused the accident. Alcohol was not involved. He stopped to render assistance whereas the driver of the second car which had been racing with him left the scene of the accident immediately. Principles of general and specific deterrence, rehabilitation, denunciation, protection of the public and maintenance of public confidence in the administration of justice were to be considered. 3)Specific deterence had to be emphasized in view of the driver's subsequent convictions for two speeding offences. The accused had six speeding convictions.

"FIAT: The parties reached an impasse on the required disclosure and sought various orders. The defendants sought an order for the Court to exercise its discretion and sever the plaintiffs' claim between liability and damages and an order that certain paragraphs of the plaintiff's claim be struck. The plaintiffs are consultants to businesses applying for scientific research and experimental development grants from the Canada Revenue Agency (SR&ED). The defendant argues that he is bound by a confidentiality and non-competition agreement with the defendants. By sharing this information with the other defendants, Wolff has breached that agreement and his contract of employment. Furthermore, the plaintiffs state that the defendant owes the plaintiffs a fiduciary duty, and by competing with the plaintiffs, he breached that duty. The plaintiff has developed their own SR&ED application process by cultivating relationships with accounting firms, industry associations, post-secondary learning institutions and various business organizations. Much of the defendant's client base results from a joint venture with a major accounting firm. This joint venture requires confidentiality. Disclosure of these relationships would jeopardize the defendants' obligation to maintain this confidentiality and the plaintiffs could be liable to the accounting firm should it breach that confidentiality. HELD: The application to sever the threshold issue of liability from damages only had merit. The defendant's counterclaim against the defendants and their two principals was dismissed. Counsel for the defendants applied pursuant to Rule 41(1) and Rule 215 of The Queen's Bench Rules and the Court's inherent jurisdiction for an order severing the issues of liability and assessment of damages. Application to strike portions of the claim dismissed. Because success has been divided, there will be no order as to costs. Any further applications pertaining to this litigation are to be directed to the first instance.","FIAT: The defendant applies pursuant to Rule 41(1) and Rule 215(1) of the Queen's Bench Rules and the inherent jurisdiction of the Court for an order severing the issues of liability and assessment of damages in the plaintiff's claim. They ask that disclosure, discoveries and the trial ought to proceed to determine whether the defendants are liable to the plaintiffs and to what extent. Then, if liability is found, disclosure, discoveries and the trial should proceed to assess damages. The defendant also seeks an order pursuant to Rule 173 of the Queen's Bench Rules striking a paragraph of the plaintiff's claim. HELD: 1) Authority to sever trials in Saskatchewan is founded on the Court's inherent jurisdiction. Laing C.J.Q.B. reviewed the discretion available to the Court in Chaban v. Kramer Ltd., 2008 SKQB 27. Upon considering the factors in Chaban, it must be concluded that the defendants' application has merit. There is clear severability between the threshold issue of liability and the consequential issue of damages in the plaintiffs' action. The entitlement to sue for disgorgement of profits hinges on whether the defendant, as the plaintiff's former employee, was in a position of a fiduciary. Disclosure pertaining to the defendants' ongoing business, financial affairs and clientele become relevant only upon a finding of liability. The Court may exercise its discretion only if the court can make a finding that the defendants will suffer severe prejudice if the issues of liability and damages are not bifurcated. Much of the defendants' client base results from a joint venture with a major accounting firm. This joint venture requires confidentiality. Disclosure of these relationships would jeopardize the defendants' obligation to maintain this confidence. Serious prejudice to the defendants in the instant case has been established. It is appropriate to exercise the Court's discretion in the defendants favour and grant the order severing the plaintiffs' claim against them. The application to sever the threshold issue of liability from damages only pertains to the plaintiffs' claim. The defendants' counterclaim against the plaintiffs and their two principals shall continue in the normal course. 2) The defendants' application to strike portions of the plaintiffs' statement of claim is dismissed. The paragraphs refer to Wolff being an applied science technologist and holding himself out as a person with a strong sense of ethics. The plaintiffs plead that the code of ethics for an applied science technologist provides that a person with such a designation will not 'use directly or indirectly an employer's or client's confidential information' in competition with the client and alleges that Wolff has breached the code of ethics. While Wolff may be subject to discipline by his governing body, that does not constitute a multiplicity of proceedings as defined by s. 29 of The Queen's Bench Act.

"The accused was charged with possession of child pornography, contrary to s. 163.1(4) of the Criminal Code. The accused was a member of the RCMP Internet Child Exploitation Unit (ICE) and testified that he monitored file sharing networks for subjects who were accessing, possessing, or sharing child pornography using file sharing software. The ICE unit was involved in the investigation. The Court found that the accused had access to child pornography through a router. The router was used to direct traffic between the residence and the residence. As the residence was often visited by persons accessing the centralized server model, it is not possible for the data to end up at some other device because of the internal IP of the computer and the physical MAC address of the particular computer.","HELD: The court found that the material viewed met the definition of child pornography as defined by the Criminal Code. Only the accused had access to his computer and knew his password. There was no evidence that the accused’s spouse was in any way involved. The evidence established that all of the file-sharing traffic came into the accused’s residence through a router that directed everything to the red computer only. The encryption on the red computer was so formidable that the best forensic technicians from the RCMP were not able to get past it. The court found that it would be unlikely for the accused not to detect a hacker given the encryption and his monitoring of bandwidth usage. A witness also testified that the accused’s operating system could not be accessed remotely. The court rejected the accused’s testimony given all of the Crown’s evidence. The Crown witnesses were all forthright and credible, whereas the accused was less forthcoming.

"HELD: The court granted interim spousal support in the amount of $500 per month for three children. The respondent filed a Notice of Objection to the petitioner's affidavit of October 2012. The petitioner did not oppose the respondent remaining in the home on a time limited basis and suggested it should terminate June 27, 2013. The parties did not reach an agreement on all issues. The court reviewed the contents of the document and indicated it could not be relied upon until ruled on its admissibility. It found the petitioner to have a Guideline income of $87,178 and the respondent a figure of $18,884. HELD: 1)The respondent was to pay child support of $1,213 per month, on account of child care expenses of $3,200 per month. On an interim basis, the court ordered that monies which he had paid from September 2012 onward be credited to the monies paid.  2)The court was satisfied that the policy considerations which underly settlement privilege required that unless all of the issues have been resolved, privilege continues to extend to those issues where there may not be a clear understanding and agreement that once one of the issue is resolved it is off the table and considered to be settled irrespective of what may happen with respect to other issues.","The petitioner and the respondent had separated and had held a settlement meeting regarding the resolution of various issues. The respondent filed a Notice of Objection to the petitioner's affidavit regarding the meeting and the appended exhibit that was entitled: 'Minutes of the Meeting'. The petitioner stated that there was no agreement that what had been agreed upon in the meeting could not be used in evidence, although he acknowledged that not all outstanding issues were resolved in the meeting. The other issues before the Court were the custody of the children, the parenting arrangements and whether the petitioner should pay interim spousal and child support and in what amount. The respondent remained in the family home and sought an order for exclusive possession. The 3 children of the marriage resided with her in it. She had recently obtained a position as an educational assistant and would be earning $19,000 per year and the petitioner's annual income was $87,000. The parties could not agree on who may claim the eligible dependant credit or AED for the children. HELD: The Court held that because the parties had not reached agreement on all of the issues, the settlement privilege extended to the agreement.

"The defendant applied for damages for personal injuries and loss sustained in an automobile collision. The jury trial was limited to assessing damages by the defendant's expert evidence. The plaintiff sustained multiple injuries including concussion, whiplash, fractured ribs, contusions and abrasions. She was rendered unconscious and remained in a state of post-traumatic amnesia for approximately 4 hours. The trial judge allowed the plaintiff's testimony to be put on the jury in the amount of $409,251.18. She challenged the trial judge's instruction to deduct sick leave benefits which were used in consequence of her injuries from the past loss of earnings component. Application dismissed; in an inflation-free economy the award for damages to replace the lost stream of income cannot be calculated simply by totalling the sum of periodic payments. The judge restricted the testimony of the expert on the basis that it might confuse the jury as to the state of the evidence. There is no clear medical evidence that the plaintiff has diminished ability to earn income in the future, or that this might result in any loss of homemaking; there is uncontradicted evidence of a partial permanent physical disability which could have an effect on her ability to work, and there is no evidence of future loss of income capacity.","The Appellant/Defendant, Bennett appealed a judgment resulting from a jury trial.

"The lease between the landlord and the tenant contained an arbitration clause. The tenant sought to have the award of the arbitrator made pursuant to that clause quashed. The lease was amended and then assigned to Loblaws. The dispute arose between the Landlord and Tenant about damage to the premises and whose responsibility it was to repair the damage. dispute also arose about insurance coverage and whether insurance should be applied. The arbitrator found the tenant liable in the sum of $318,252 for repairs and $59,130.34 for loss of rental opportunity. The landlord sought to quash the award. HELD: 1)The arbitrator was not limited to interpreting the clauses of the lease. He could deal with the issue of insurance coverage. He did not have jurisdiction to award damages. The principles of waiver and estoppel applied as against the tenant. 2)The arbitration clause under the lease was a limited arbitration clause which did not provide that all disputes between the parties were to be settled by arbitration, but only disputes with regard to clauses or provisions of the leases. There was no jurisdiction to resolve the claim such as this which arises from the Landowner/Tenant relationship itself and not the clauses and provisions of a lease. 3)The issues of responsibility for repairs, whether the loss was covered by insurance and whether notification or claim was required were issues within the jurisdiction of the Arbitrator.

"The accused was charged with operating a motor vehicle while his ability to do so was impaired by alcohol or drug contrary to s. 255(1) and 253(1)(a) of the Criminal Code, and with driving while over.08 contrary to ss. 253(2) and 254(1(b) of that Code. The accused asserts that he was arbitrarily detained as the officer did not have reasonable grounds to make a demand for a sample of his breath for analysis. HELD: The admission of the evidence would not bring the administration of justice into disrepute. The breach was not the result of wilful or blatant disrespect of the Charter by the officer nor was it prima facie unreasonable. Based on the totality of the above evidence, it would be ludicrous to suggest that the officer reasonably could have only a mere suspicion that the accused had alcohol in his body. The evidence paints a virtual stereotypic portrait of a motorist impaired by driving, the absence of the smell of alcohol or any admission of consumption of beverage alcohol does not vitiate the probative value of the other indicia considered in their totality. The Court held that the driving irregularities and the physical symptoms of the accused painted a virtual stereotype of the motorist who had impaired by the alcohol. Consequently, the Court found that it was reasonable to conclude that the most obvious cause of impairment by alcohol was impairment by the blood alcohol level.  1) The officer had reasonable grounds, both from the perspective of the officer making the demand and an objective observer, to make the demand for breath samples. 2) The absence of any indicia commonly found in impaired drivers does not undermine a finding of reasonable and probable grounds based on the observed indicia and available information viewed in totality. 3) The Court found no breach of s. 8 or s. 9 of the Code and the Certificate of Analysis was therefore admissible. 4) The accused was found not guilty.","The accused was charged with impaired driving and driving over .08. He argued that the investigating officer did not have reasonable and probable grounds to make a breath demand pursuant to s. 254(3) of the Criminal Code resulting in the arbitrary detention of the accused. The accused argued the Certificate of Analysis should be excluded. The officer responded to complaint of possible impaired driver weaving on the roadway and onto the sidewalk. The officer located vehicle with the same licence plate number. He observed the vehicle weaving from right to left in its lane. The vehicle braked suddenly and made right turn from the left lane. The officer activated his emergency equipment. The vehicle pulled over quickly but lurched forward and stopped abruptly as the officer walked towards the vehicle. The accused had glossy eyes, slurred speech, poor muscular control, difficulty extracting his licence and displayed poor balance when walking to the police vehicle. The officer did not note smell of alcohol. HELD: In this case, there was no dispute that the officer's belief in reasonable and probable grounds was honestly held and subjectively valid. While the officer could have asked the accused if he had been drinking alcohol, the weight to be given to any response from the officer was subjective Ã» he was not required to accept what he was told. Although it is possible to speculate that the symptoms of impairment in this case were caused by some medical condition, there is no evidence of any other possible explanation for the egregious driving and physical condition of the accused. In the absence of any evidence suggesting an alternative explanation, it is reasonable to conclude that the most obvious case was impairment by alcohol. The driving pattern and physical symptoms of the accused paint a stereotypical portrait of a motorist impaired by alcohol. The absence of a smell of alcohol or any admission of consumption does not vitiate the probative value of the other indicia when considered in their totality. In the face of the manner of driving and very significant symptoms of impairment, it would be ludicrous to suggest that the officer could only have had a reasonable suspicion that the accused had alcohol in his body.

"The appellant sought an order quashing the adjudicator's decision following a hearing pursuant to s. 62.1 and 62.2 of The Labour Standards Act. The appellant's president did not examine his company's lease in order to determine whether the rights of access and egress were guaranteed to the applicant and her employees (which seems likely) and the employer were to ask the employer whether it was acting reasonably and to make the inquiry (just described) of the franchisor. The adjudicator rejected the applicant's submission that the employer had frustrated or breached her employment contract, thereby releasing the appellant from any obligation to pay wages in lieu of notice. The employer then launched an appeal. HELD: The appeal was dismissed with costs. 1)The adjudicator applied the appropriate principles of law to the facts as found by the appellant. His decision outlined some evidence upon which he could have arrived at his conclusions. Although not all of the facts presented to the Court were known to this Court, his decision outlines some evidence on which he might have arrived upon his conclusions sooner. 2)The employer surely must be expected to make further inquiries and to engage in further efforts to ensure that it can comply with its obligations under the employment contract (i.e. to permit its employees access to the workplace) before it can claim that it is incapable of performing its contractual obligations. 3)Cajon acted well within its jurisdiction when determining what the terms of Ms. Kovach's employment contract were and that Cajon had not fulfilled obligations thereunder.","The appellant sought an order quashing a decision of an adjudicator following a hearing pursuant to s. 62 of the Labour Standards Act. The Director of Labour Standards ordered the employer to pay $1,500 in lieu of a proper notice of termination. The grounds raised were that the adjudicator erred in law in finding the respondent had not frustrated or fundamently breached her employment contract; the adjudicator exceeded his jurisdiction by holding the employer had an obligation to attempt to resolve the workplace difficulties that prohibited the respondent from reporting to work. The employee had been charged with stealing three pencils on her way through a store to the salon where she worked. The Crown subsequently withdrew the shoplifting charges. She was prohibited from returning that the store and as there was no alternate entrance to the salon the employer treated the contract as frustrated or breached, therefore releasing him of any obligation to pay wages in lieu of notice. HELD: The appeal was dismissed with costs. 1)The adjudicator concluded the employer failed to meet the thresholds stipulated in O'Connell which set out the six essential elements for determining whether events had frustrated an employment contract: a critical rather than a trivial supervening event; an event protracted in time; not within the contemplation of the parties; coming about without fault on either party; an event that rendered the parties incapable of performing their contractual obligations; the performance of a contract would radically alter the original agreement into something other than that intended.

"The appellant applied for leave to appeal and, if granted, to appeal the interlocutory order of Justice Simon J. MacDonald refusing to appoint a court expert and refusing to order the appellant to answer certain interrogatories, the majority of which call for his opinion concerning the medical services provided by the respondent. The appellant alleged negligence in the performance of the circumcision. The respondent did not attend the hearing and indicated by letter that he supported the appellant's position that the appellant should re-answer the interrogatories he previously objected to on the basis of opinion, but provided the names of three other urologists who were also referred to by the appellant and declined to act as expert witnesses. HELD: Leave to appeal was granted and the appeal was allowed in part.  1)The appellant was correct in stating that the chambers judge considered the issue of opinion and that he erred by overstating the basis upon which a non-party witness may object to answer an interrogatory calling for an opinion, even if this requires the physician to disclose the opinions that went into the formation of his judgment in diagnosing and treating the appellant. The distinction between fact and opinion may not be clear. The chambers judge erred in failing to provide proper notice to the parties of experts opinions to avoid surprise and help the trier of fact discover the truth.  2)To allow interrogatories to usurp this function, without the presence of such safeguards for the parties, the experts and the court, would not be in accordance with the orderly and fair trial practice and procedure that the Civil Procedure Rules promote.  3)Leave to appeal is granted and, in part as provided in the standard of review, the appellant is allowed to add a disbursement of the amount paid to the appellant for his attendance at discovery.","The plaintiff appealed an interlocutory decision in which the chambers judge held that a non-party medical doctor who had provided emergency treatment to the plaintiff did not have to answer certain interrogatories on the basis that they required an opinion.

"The accused were convicted of using a searchlight for the purpose of hunting wildlife, contrary to s. 11.1(3) of the Saskatchewan Regulations passed pursuant to The Wildlife Act, 1998. The accused appealed their conviction on the grounds that the trial judge erred in law in holding that the appellants as Metis, within the meaning of s. 7(1)(a)(i) of The Natural Resources Transfer Agreement, 1930 did not have an Aboriginal right to hunt at night with a search light. HELD: The appeal was dismissed. 1)The trial judge correctly identified the test for justification of a legitimate regulation of a constitutional aboriginal right, the Sparrow test, and the safety purpose of the legislation. 2)The appellant had failed to show any error in law. The trial judge did not refer to the Sparrow tests as an error in Law. The issue was whether the limiting legislation was a prima facie infringement of the appellant's right and, if so, whether it was justifiable. 3)The objective was primarally safety and it was prima fide infringement of aboriginal rights. The question was whether s.11.1 was a legitimate regulatory exercise and whether s11.2(3)(a) was justified. 4)The court was unable to accept the appellation's argument that the accused were Indians under the meaning s.7(a)(ii) of that Act, 1930 and preferred as a community to hunt in the night with artificial lights. The evidence did not show that the appellant were Indians within the Meaning of s7(1) of s3 of the Constitution Act, nor did it show that they had an Aboriginal or Treaty right to hunted at night. The appeal could not be reversed on appeal.","An appeal from a summary conviction for unlawfully using a searchlight for the purpose of hunting. The trial judge made three distinct and alternate findings: based on the evidence presented, night hunting with an artificial light is so inherently dangerous as not to attract protection as an aboriginal right; based on the Sparrow test for prima facie infringement and justification, s.11.1(3) of the Regulations withstands both prima facie infringement and justifiability scrutiny; based on the authorities, s.11.1(3) of the Regulations does not touch the appellant's core as Indians and, therefore, does not give rise to interjurisdictional immunity. The trial judge found that aboriginal hunting rights must be exercised subject to any legislation that expresses legitimate safety concerns. The facts were not in dispute. The appellants, who were of Metis heritage and engaged in the traditional Metis way of life, argued they enjoy hunting rights within the meaning of s.12 of the Natural Resources Transfer Act and are exempt from any hunting prohibition when hunting on unoccupied Crown land. The respondent acknowledged that if they are Metis, they enjoy an aboriginal right to hunt for food as protected by s.35(1) of the Constitution Act, 1982. However, they are subject to the regulation prohibiting night hunting with artificial lights (except when hunting on a Reserve) because its primary objective is safety. At issue was whether the appellants, as Metis, are subject to s.11.1(3)of the Saskatchewan Regulations passed pursuant to the Wildlife Act. HELD: The appeal was dismissed. 1)The appellants failed to come within s.686(1)(a)(i) or (ii) of the Criminal Code. 2)The findings were supported by the evidence and were reasonable. There was no wrong decision on a question of law.  3)Aboriginal and Treaty rights are not absolute. Reasonable regulations aimed at ensuring safety do not infringe these rights. Laws having a safety objective do not infringe aboriginal rights. As safety legislation, s.13.1(3) has a conservation component. The Province has jurisdiction to pass conservation laws. Legislation prohibiting night hunting with artificial lights has been considered by the courts of several provinces. All courts found the practice dangerous and upheld the limiting provincial legislation. 4)The Court preferred the approach taken in R. v. Bernard, which is to consider safety as a factor in determining prima facie infringement and if necessary, justification pursuant to the Sparrow test. The issue in this case is whether the limiting legislation is a prima facie infringement on the appellants' right to hunt for food and if so, whether it is justifiable. Since Sparrow, it has become unnecessary and perhaps inappropriate to attempt to define aboriginal hunting rights. Sparrow presented three questions when deciding whether there has been a prima facie infringement of hunting rights: is the limitation reasonable; does the regulation cause undue hardship; does it deny their preferred means of exercising that right. In Seward and Bernard, the Sparrow test of infringement and justification was the only test applied. No infringement was found in either case. 5)The trial judge concluded the practice of night hunting by means of artificial light is highly dangerous. The prohibition was found not only to be reasonable but essential. The regulation presented no undue hardship and was never the preferred means of hunting by people of Sapwagamik. The legislation could not be considered a diminution of any assumed aboriginal right and there was thus no prima facie infringement of hunting rights by s.11.1(3).  6)It was not accepted that because Reserves are exempted, safety was not the primary purpose. Reserves were exempt out of respect for Band Council's right to pass their own safety laws pursuant to the Indian Act. 7)The trial judge correctly identified the test for justification of a legitimate regulation as being whether the legislation has a valid objective; whether the honour of the Crown is at stake; has there been as little infringement as possible; has the aboriginal group been consulted. 8)Section 11.1(3) restricts the method of hunting at night and to that extent it likely is a conservation infringement. If so, it is still permissible provincial legislation. It meets the Sparrow justification test because of the strong safety component. 9)Provincial hunting laws regulate aboriginal hunting rights; they do not extinguish them. Accordingly, such laws do not cross the interjurisdictional immunity boundary. They do not touch the core of Indians at the heart of s.91(24) of the Constitution. The regulation applies to appellants as hunters, not as Metis.",2002skqb68.txt,"An appeal from a summary conviction for unlawfully using a searchlight for the purpose of hunting.

"The Landlord and Tenant appealed a decision of the Director allowing the Landlord the sum of $787.50 as compensation for a breach of the statutory condition to provide premises suitable for habitation. The Landlord had allowed mould to develop in her basement, which was riddled with mould. She also produced evidence of medical letters to the effect that her children suffered from asthma and ought not to be exposed to mould. The mother of two children testified that she was affected by the mould. When the mould first began to develop the Tenant called the Halifax Regional Municipality office which sent a bylaw enforcement officer to investigate. That officer recommended a dehumidifier be placed in the basement. The bylaw inspector testified that he detected mould and the conditions that allowed the mold to develop. Photographs of the mouldy conditions were placed in evidence. The condition was clearly described by the mother. She asked why if there was mould that only affected the Tenants furniture and area rug and was not obvious on the other carpeting. Appeal allowed; damages are set at $862.50. The Director was essentially correct in discounting the value of the rug and clothing. She was not credible and her explanation is not probable. On a strong balance of probabilities it was the landlord's responsibility to rectify same, and she did not. It was impossible to believe that she could have been fooled by something as amateurish as spray paint.","The Director of Residential Tenancies ordered compensation after he found that the landlord allowed mouldy conditions to develop in the premises and failed to rectify same, with the result that some of the tenant's belongings were ruined. The landlord appealed, taking the position that there had been no mould and the tenant had simply used grey spray paint to resemble mould.

"The deceased's surviving spouse received a death benefit for herself and for her two children pursuant to the Automobile Accident Insurance Act. She took issue with the calculation of the death benefit, arguing that it was based on the deceased's gross income rather than on his gross income. SGI appealed the decision to the Court of Queen's Bench. HELD: The respondent's decision was set aside and the estate was directed to recalculate and pay the respondent the Death Benefit to her as a surviving spouse and her two dependent children in accordance with the directions of this Court. 1)SGI did not refer to the income replacement benefit in s.146(1) as it does in Division 4. The deceased was entitled to receive a lump sum payment of $45,000 for each child born after the accident. 2)The deceased received no benefit less than the $603 per week paid to her by SGI. The 'income replacement benefit' referred to in the Act is a self-contained formula. The meaning of this is that the payment is made to the survivor on a weekly basis.","The surviving spouse of the insured deceased, who died in a motor vehicle accident, took issue with the calculation of the death benefit paid for herself and her two children which had been reviewed and approved by SGI. At issue was whether the weekly income replacement benefit referred to in Division 5 of the Act had a separate and distinct meaning from the income replacement benefit in Division 4. HELD: SGI's decision was set aside and SGI was directed to recalculate and pay the death benefit to the surviving spouse and dependent children in accordance with the directions of the court.  1)The Interpretation Act requires legislation be given a fair, large and liberal construction to best assure the attainment of its objectives and that definitions given apply to the entire statute and regulations unless a contrary intention appears in the statute or regulations. 2)The phrase income replacement benefit (IRB) used in s136(1) is not analogous to the IRB in s146(1). There is no requirement to use the formula in s136(1) to calculate the surviving spouse's death benefit. S146(1) is a self-contained formula. 3)Because the Act is silent on a maximum yearly employment income the actual income earned is the sum that is used to determine the IRB in s146(1). The ordinary meaning of a death benefit being one-half the weekly IRB is that the payment is made on a weekly basis. 4)The IRB as calculated in s146(5) is the same as the IRB in s 146(1). 5)Leave was granted for the parties to bring the matter back, if required, with respect to the interest on benefits not paid.",9_1996canlii6888.txt,"The surviving spouse of the insured deceased, who died in a motor vehicle accident, took issue with the calculation of the death benefit paid for herself and her two children which had been reviewed and approved by SGI.

"The defendant Government of Saskatchewan tendered a spruce bud worm aerial spraying program in northern Saskatchewan. Four companies submitted tenders in response to the defendant's invitation to tender. The plaintiff submitted the lowest tender which was awarded to another tenderer who had less experience in the area and got favourable reports. The Plaintiff sued for damages. HELD: The action was dismissed. 1)An implied term of the contract is that the person inviting the tenders agrees to treat all tenderers fairly and not give any of them an unfair advantage over the others. 2)Curniski used reliable independent sources for his information. The tender package contained the usual privilege clause: The lowest, or any tender need not be accepted by the defendant. This clause does not entitle the defendant to disregard its obligation to treat the tender system and no tenders to accept. 3)Cuziski conducted his investigation in a fair and impartial manner and in accordance with common industry practice.  4)Had it been an event of fact, the plaintiff would have been more successful. The unfavourable report on the plaintiff's planes doomed the tender.

"The Ministry of Social Services sought a six month order pursuant to s. 37(c) of The Child and Family Services Act with respect to the two children. HELD: The order was granted. The children were to be returned to the father by the end of 2008 with a condition that they remain in the mother's care and that they not be exposed to drug use or domestic violence. The father would continue living with the mother and take anger management courses. He proposed to address his own addiction problems. The evidence showed that the mother had been on methadone for most of her life and that the father had indicated that he would like to return the children to her. Although the mother was unrepresented, the father testified that he had signed a PSA promising to participate in parenting classes, attend anger management and provide all drug screen results, remain drug free and provide support to the children. The documents filed at the Family Law Division show that both the father and the mother appeared to be doing well apart from the screens. H.H. was the mother, and the father appeared to have a stronger relationship with the children and was able to work with the Ministry to facilitate long term placement plans for both children. Although both the parents were in the care of the Ministry, both were in need of immediate access to services and support would be provided by the Ministry and the parents would have the opportunity to contact the children's counsellor, participate in programming, provide support and provide addiction screen results. The mother was to reside with the father on the First Nation for the duration of the child's life and to assist him in addressing his addiction issues. The child was apprehended at birth as was the father. Both children were the subject of a consent order for six months on October 2, 2007. Both were in residential care for the first time since the child was born. The parents were to attend a parenting class on a non-consecutive basis and the children would have access to a substance abuse treatment program. The issues before the Ministry was to determine the appropriate treatment options for the children as well as the parents' access to alcohol and drugs. The nature of the problem is that the Ministry has not been able to provide adequate access to addiction treatment and the evidence before them has been conclusive. There is a substantial risk that the children will relapse and the impact on the children if they do relapse will outweigh the benefits to the parents. As the children are in the early years of their lives the","The Ministry of Social Services seeks a 6 month order pursuant to s. 37(c) of The Child and Family Services Act with respect to the two children, NS is four years old and DS is two years old. DS was apprehended by the Ministry when he was born. Both NS and DS were the subject of a consent order for 6 months in October 2007. Both children have been in care for most of their lives. The Ministry requests a six month order with a proviso that it be for the purposes of allowing the Ministry to make long term placement plans for both children. The mother HH is not seeking a return of the children to her but supports the position of NOS, the father, who ask that the children be returned to him in his care. HELD: 1) If the children are returned to NOS, they will not receive a level of parenting that is above the minimal standard that will be tolerated by our society. Both children have some difficulties which must be managed carefully to ensure their continued growth and improvement. 2) Given the difficulties the parents struggle with, they can not provide that management. The Ministry has tendered substantial evidence of criminal activity on the part of NOS and police involvement in the life of HH. The criminal behaviour of NOS in and of itself would not disqualify him from parenting the children if the children were not exposed to that behaviour. There is a risk that the children may be exposed to such behaviour in the future. There is no evidence that NOS has done so in the past. The evidence of domestic violence is equivocal. There is evidence of consistent fighting and disruption of their relationship in the past. The Court finds that the relationship is unstable. The parents' addictions continue to loom large in their lives and relationship. The Court is not convinced that the father's addiction has been stabilized and is fully under control. There have been slip-ups and missed appointments at the methadone clinic. This should not be visited on the children. HH is even less advanced in dealing with her addictions than NOS. The evidence indicates good intentions but not the personal strength to take and complete programming whether offered by the methadone client, or ordered as a condition of the court. This is troubling because if the parents don't have the strength to achieve this, there is a question as to whether they have the personal strength to provide the minimal care for these children required by law on a day to day basis. 3) If the children are returned to NOS, they are likely to suffer physical and emotional harm. While the parents have had successful visits with the children while in care and had a period of some months where the children were apparently looked after by them, this does not convince the Court that they belong with NOS. The day to day stress of parenting is substantially different than visits of several hours. The evidence does not convince the Court that the children would receive consistent care month after month despite one past success in doing so. The children are in need of protection and should not be returned to NOS or HH. 4) Although the Ministry seeks a 6 month order with the notation that it is for the purposes of permanency planning, the Court is not inclined to make such an order. A 6 month order is premised on a reasonable prospect of change by the parents within a reasonable time. The parents have this opportunity to demonstrate that they are serious about changing their lives so that their children can be returned to them.",d_2009skqb44.txt,"The Ministry of Social Services seeks a 6 month order pursuant to s. 37(c) of The Child and Family Services Act with respect to the two children, NS is four years old and DS is two years old.

"The accused is a repeat violent and sexual offender who was still serving a sentence for sexual assault and out on a weekend parole pass when he committed his last sexual assault offence against his 14 year old niece. He was returned to prison and served his entire sentence to warrant expiry before being placed on s. 810.1 peace bond recognizance in 2010 and then again in 2012. The Crown now applies for third recognition. HELD: The accused is granted a security deposit of $1,000.00.  1) The Court found that an objective person armed with the same knowledge would agree that the fears of Corporal Teniuk, the RCMP officer in charge of the High Risk Offender Response Unit and Ms. Woytiuk, that R.N.S. will commit either a serious personal injury offence or sexual assault involving someone under the age of 16 years and requests that the accused be bound over to keep the peace and be of good behaviour. 2) The accused has 59 prior criminal convictions. He entered the criminal justice system at a young age. He continued to re-offend and became entrenched there. There was no de-escalation in the violence, drugs and alcohol he suffered while incarcerated. There were no less than 20 failures to comply with lawful court orders. The three escapes from lawful custody are important as they provide an insight to the accused's degree of impulsivity and inability to telegraph his behaviour. The accused's security risks can either be downgraded or upgraded based upon his actions while in prison. There is a reasonably grounded fear of serious and imminent danger which must be proved on a balance of probabilities.","Criminal Law – Recognizance The defendant was a repeat violent and sexual offender who was still serving a sentence for sexual assault and out on a weekend parole pass when he committed his last sexual assault offence against his 14-year-old niece. He was returned to prison and served his entire sentence to warrant expiry before being placed on a s. 810.1 peace bond recognizance upon his release from prison in 2010 and then again in 2012. The Crown then applied for a third recognizance. An RCMP officer with the High Risk Offender/Serious Violent Offender Response Unit swore an Information that he had reasonable grounds to believe that the defendant would commit either a serious personal injury or a sexual assault offence against someone under the age of 16 years and requested that he be bound over. A parole officer with Correctional Services Canada also testified to the defendant’s history in the federal prison and to her belief that based, upon his history, the defendant remained at high risk to re-offend. The Crown indicated that it was looking for one recognizance, either under s. 810.2 or s. 810.1 of the Criminal Code. The defendant had 59 prior criminal convictions, 12 of which related to sexual or common assaults. He had a serious alcohol abuse problem and committed most of the assaults while intoxicated.

"The plaintiff underwent bilateral augmentation mamoplasty and received silicone breast implants manufactured by Dow Corning Canada Inc. (Dow Chemical). Ten years later, she received replacement breast implants, bearing the trade name Surgitek, which were manufactured by Medical Engineering Corporation and Bristol-Myers Squibb Company. In 1992 she had the breast implants removed. The plaintiff now suffers from fibromyalgia, chronic fatigue and a persistent immune mediated skin rash. The Court is also asked to set aside the duty to disclose the risk inherent to the breast implant. The defendant denies the allegations. HELD: The statement of claim was dismissed. 1)There is no causal connection between the defendant, the Dow Chemical Company, and the plaintiff's damages. Rather, the pleadings portray nothing more than a relationship akin to that of vicarious liability between the defendants, The Dow Chemical company and one of the other defendants, namely, Dow Corcorning Corporation. 2)Dow chemical was founded in 1897 in the State of Michigan and incorporated in the state of Delaware in 1947. At present it is publicly held corporation organized under the laws of the state Delaware having its principal offices in Midland, Michigan. 3)The plaintiff is assumed to have suffered damages both in contract and tort. She is also alleged to have been directly and indirectly caused by the actions of the defendant. There is a causal connection to the defendant's and Dow Chemical's negligence. 4)The defendant is at law responsible for the liabilities of Dow Chemical. This differs significantly from vicarious Liability where no fault is attributable to the third party, but there is a relationship such as that of an employer, employee, or principal agent.

Dow Chemical argued that there was no causal connection between it and the plaintiff's damages. HELD: The application was dismissed. The plaintiff was awarded her taxable costs in any event of the cause.

"FIAT: The defendant applied pursuant to Rule 41(2) of the Queen's Bench Rules for an order that this action and Tsatsi v. College of Physicians and Surgeons, Don McMorris and Sunrise Health Region, be tried together. HELD: 1) This is a defamation action based on statements that the plaintiff alleges were made by the defendant on June 1, 2009. The statements made specific allegations about the plaintiff's failure to properly read an x-ray, and also alleged that health officials knew the plaintiff should not be doing the work he was doing. 2) The defendant has leave to amend his Statement of Defence by pleading: Such words as were spoken or written by the Defendant are true and the evidence in the College Action be evidence in this action.

"This was an appeal from a judgment under The Matrimonial Property Act which dealt with whether the judge erred in his distribution of assets acquired with the proceeds of a severance package which the appellant received when his employment of twenty-three years was suddenly and unexpectedly terminated.

If the package represented future wages for 20. 4 months from the date of termination, then from that date (September 1990) to the cessation of the marital relationship, it should not be shareable. 2)The judge did not fail to take into consideration that the wife had taken a quantity of furniture and household goods and that, as a result, he failed to give the husband credit for his one-half share of them.","Appeal from 107 SaskR 135, 44 RFL(3d)185.

"The original plaintiff issued his claim under The Class Actions Act for breach of consumer protection and sale of goods legislation, breach of warranty, negligence the Competition Act and waiver of tort. The claim seeks to recover damages on behalf of those who purchased the defendants' 'Low Sodium' beverages (the 'Class' or 'Class Members'), but ultimately received beverages which were no lower or not appreciably lower in sodium than other, non-Low Sodium beverages. The defendants claim that they should receive summary judgment in favour of their claim is clearly without merit. There is no evidence that the plaintiffs were misled about the sodium content of the drink they purchased, nor did they rely upon the low sodium label when making the purchase and find they did not suffer any damages. HELD: The application for summary judgment was dismissed. 1)The plaintiff admitted that the defendants knowingly leveraged the national awareness campaign for sodium-reduction among Canadians, misrepresented its product as 'low sodium' versus the other in its category and misled consumers into purchasing its product based on this claim.

"The plaintiff and his wife sued the defendant corporation for the return of a deposit they gave to the defendant. The defendant corporation was in the business of building decks and sunrooms and had been for 18 years. The plaintiff wanted to construct a glass sunroom on the back of their home and alleged that the defendant had misappropriated the funds necessary to construct the project. Both parties acted in good faith. The contract was frustrated when it was discovered that the intended foundation could not be constructed due to the high ground water in the town of Warman and specifically on the Ens job site. The dispute note awarded the plaintiff $176.22. In the action, the defendant argued that the plaintiff failed to prove its claim on a balance of probabilities. In his counterclaim, the plaintiff argued that he was owed $3,604.13, which he alleged represented misappropriation of funds from the defendant corporate entity. The defendants counterclaimed for monies they had already paid to the plaintiff corporation and claimed damages for errors in the contract price. The court awarded judgment in favour of the plaintiff in the counterclaim and against the defendant in the Counterclaim for a balance that was owing to them. HELD: The plaintiff was awarded the sum of $1,758.45 and the defendant $2,200.00 as costs. Based on the facts presented in the case, a just and reasonable resolution demanded that the value of the expenses lost due to frustration of the contract should be borne by the parties in a 65/35 ratio.  1)The plaintiff was entitled to pay the sum directly or indirectly.  2)Costs were not reasonably for the court to find the plaintiff responsible for the misavocations of funds.  3)The defendant corporation may be able to further mitigate its losses by using more parts salvaged from the material left over in the failed Ens project. The difference was much more than mere inconvenience. The petitioner should bear 65% of the loss and the plaintiff should bear 35% in the loss.  4)The frustrating event or circumstance occurred after the issuance of the counter-claim. The parties were not on an equal plane because the plaintiff had more experience in constructing glass sunrooms but the defendant relied on the contractors experience to some degree. The change affected the fundamental nature of the Contract and the contract as a result would be totally different from what the parties intended.","The plaintiffs wanted to build deck and glass sunroom on the back of their home.

"The appellant appealed its acquittal on a charge that it sold tobacco or a tobacco product to a person under the age of 19 years contrary to s. 5(1) of the Tobacco Access Act. The issues at trial involved the constitutionality of the Act and the defence of due diligence. The trial judge found that federal legislation had 'occupied the field' with the Tobacco Act, S.C. 13, that it 'cannot stand side by side with the provincial legislation', and that the federal legislation therefore prevails. Having found the legislation to be unconstitutional, an acquittal was entered. The appellant appealed. Allowing the appeal and setting aside the matter of the trial judge's finding, that he erred in finding the provincial Statute unconstitutional. The proper method of analysis in this case has three steps. First, it is necessary to determine the matter, or the 'pith and substance' of each of the federal and provincial laws. We are satisfied that the Province's tobacco access act is legislation in relation to the health of young persons. As for federal legislation, the doctrine of respondeat superior has no application. Where an employer is charged in respect of an act committed by an employee acting in the course of employment, the question will be whether the act took place without the accused's direction or approval... and whether the accused exercised all reasonable care by establishing a proper system to prevent commission and by taking reasonable steps to ensure the effective operation of the system.","The respondent grocery store was charged with selling tobacco to a person under the age of 19, contrary to s. 5(1) of the Tobacco Access Act. The actus reus of the act was clearly proved at trial. The trial judge acquitted as a result of his finding that the legislation was ultra vires the Province. He reasoned that federal legislation had 'occupied the field' with the Tobacco Act, that the federal legislation cannot stand side by side with the provincial legislation, and that the federal legislation therefore prevails. The trial judge further commented that, had the Act been constitutional, he would have convicted because he did not accept the accused's defence of due diligence. The Crown appealed, and the accused cross-appealed. Allowing the appeal and remitting the matter to Provincial Court for trial, that the Tobacco Access Act is legislation in relation to matters of health, and therefore within provincial jurisdiction. It does not conflict with the federal Tobacco Act. The trial judge therefore erred in finding that the Tobacco Access Act was ultra vires. The trial judge also erred in law with respect to the defence of due diligence.

"The respondent was convicted of driving with an illegal blood alcohol level (BAC) after a stop by RCMP. He was given a breathalyzer on the basis that he was impaired by alcohol. The Crown appealed on the ground that the summary conviction appeal court decision had erred respecting arbitrary detention and the exclusion of evidence of the breathalyzers result under s. 24(2) of the Charter. The respondent appealed on grounds that the stop was an improper exercise of his right to counsel pursuant to s. 9 of the Canadian Charter. Dismissing the appeal, that the wording of the Saskatchewan Act and the Saskatchewan Police Act do not constitute reasonable and probable grounds to justify random stops. The broad wording of s. 119 of the Highway Traffic Act and its authorized breathalycers is not the only reason why the stop should be justified.","The respondent was convicted at trial with illegal blood alcohol level while operating a motor vehicle.

"The accused was charged with mischief under $5,000.00 by smashing a window and with aggravated assault. The major issue for determination was whether the accused can be convicted of the charge of aggravated assault or whether she should be sentenced to one of the lesser and included offences. HELD: The accused was convicted of mischief. The court found that the mens rea required for common assault is identical. All that is required is an intent to wound or maim or disfigure. The section pertains to an assault that has the consequences of wounding, maiming or disfiguring the victim. This is simply not believable. The accused is guilty of aggravated assaulted. The Court of Appeal concluded that the Crown has not proved the requisite intent to sustain convictions under s. 267 or s. 268 of the Criminal Code. The inescapable conclusion is that the accused struck the complainant in the facial area with the candle holder. The injuries were caused by a single backhanded blow.","The accused was charged with aggravated assault and mischief. The evidence on the aggravated assault was that the accused had struck the victim in the face with a plastic candle holder. The victim suffered significant injury to his face and eye, which was still noticeable 6 weeks later. The victim testified that the accused had been drinking and the parties got into an argument. The victim touched the accused on the back in an effort to calm her down and she spun around and struck the victim in the face with the candle holder. The accused gave a warned statement and testified at trial that she believed she had backhanded the victim with her fist. In her warned statement, she qualified her denial by saying that her recollection was not clear and that she didn't really remember. The evidence on the mischief was that when the police attended to the residence after the victim had gone by ambulance to hospital and the accused was standing in front of the house in front of a broken window. HELD: The accused was convicted of aggravated assault. The inescapable conclusion from the evidence is that the accused struck the victim in the face with the candle holder.

"This was an application by the applicants for a judicial review of a decision of one of the respondents The Saskatchewan Liquor and Gaming Commission (SLGLC). The applicants were the owners of two horses that were involved in a $15,000stakes race that comprised the sixth race on that day's card and featured a field of eight horses. The horses were moved up in the standings as a result of the result. The decision of the Commission was patently unreasonable. The applicants argued that the tribunal whose decision was under review had failed to inquire into certain evidence and had made incorrect factual findings based on the evidence. HELD: The application was allowed. The matter was remitted back to the Commission to be dealt with according to law after the appropriate notices have been given to the applicants. 1) Did the Commission Breach the Rules of Natural Justice by Failing to Give Notice of the Hearing to the Applicants? Such information is irrelevant to the questions which are before this Court on judicial review. 2) The Commission's decision to refuse to give notice of the hearing is patently unreasonably unreasonable. 3) The evidence adduced at a hearing is not part of the record and the Court cannot review the evidence as to whether they were correctly or erroneously made.","An application for a judicial review of a decision by the Saskatchewan Liquor and Gaming Commission which held that the veering to the left by the two horses was within the tolerance of interference at the gate for two year olds. The Commission overturned the decision of the stewards and restored the horse declared to be in first place. In issue was whether the hearsay opinions of stewards from other jurisdictions were admissible; whether the Commission exceeded its jurisdiction by overturning the steward's decision to disqualify the horse; whether the Commission breached the rules of natural justice by failing to give notice of the hearing to the applicants. The respondents contended the privative clause in the Act gives the Commission the right to interpret the notice provisions of its empowering statute subject only to judicial review on the patently unreasonable standard. HELD: The application was allowed and the decision of the Commission was quashed. The matter was remitted to the Commission to be dealt with according to law after the appropriate notices have been given to the applicants. 1)The opinions were not only inadmissible as hearsay but were irrelevant to the present proceedings.  2)The law is well established that the Court in certiorari proceedings is restricted to determining whether or not the inferior statutory tribunal acted within its jurisdiction or there is an error on the face of the record. The evidence adduced at a hearing is not part of the record.  3)The provisions in both the rules of the Saskatchewan Liquor and Gaming Authority for the conduct of horse racing and the Alcohol and Gaming Regulation Act clearly entitle the Commission to overturn a decision of the stewards based on the Commission's own assessment of the evidence. The stewards were not vested with the sole authority to determine whether there was interference at the gate. 4)Knight v. Indian Head School Division set out that the existence of a general duty to act fairly on the part of a public authority depends on three factors: the nature of the decision, the relationship between the body and the individual, and the effect of the decision on the individual. 5)A miscarriage of justice occurred because the Commission did not give adequate or any notice to the applicants and failed to give them an opportunity to make submissions.

"The accused was convicted, after trial, of fraud exceeding five thousand dollars. He wrote a cheque for $11,000 on his personal bank account knowing that the account lacked sufficient funds. He deposited the money into his CIBC Visa account and the next day withdrew $13,000. CIBC lost the entire $24,000 due to a rather intricate kiting system. The accused had no criminal record and asked that a conditional discharge be imposed with a condition of 200 hours of community service work. The Crown took issue with the discharge and asked for a 12 month conditional sentence, plus 200 hours OF community service. The Provincial Court judge granted a conditional sentence with a probation order of 1 year and a requirement of 200 hour of community work and a restitution order in the amount of $24000. The applicant appealed. Appeal allowed orally; the conditional sentence is substituted by a 12-month conditional sentence; the Crown must perform 200 hours community service as required by the probation order and the applicant must make restitution to CIBC. The conditional sentence was appropriate but the Crown was asked to provide 200 hours service as part of the conditional period and the application for leave to appeal was allowed orally.","The respondent was convicted after trial of fraud exceeding $5,000 contrary to s. 380(1)(a) of the Criminal Code.

He also made a restitution order in the amount of $24,000. The Crown appeals asking that a 12 month conditional sentence be imposed with a condition of 200 hours of community service.

"The tenants entered a year to year lease in which they were allowed to increase the rent on three months written notice. The landlord refused on the grounds that the increase was only once every twelve months. The board held that it could not rely on the specific provision with respect to rent payable in the lease, as the lease was automatically renewed for a further term of one year if neither party gave notice of termination at least three months prior to the date of the renewal. The appellant appealed. Allowing the appeal and setting aside the decision of the trial judge and the decision and recommendation of the board, that the interpretation of the Act, the Rent Review Act and the Standard Form of Lease were clear. The respondent could not unilaterally increase the rents during the yearly tenancy, for it would violate the tenants' common law right to notice.","The issue in this appeal was whether a landlord can give notice of a rental increase at any time during a yearly tenancy under the Standard Form Lease. Section of the lease provides for increases upon months notice to the tenant. The trial judge found that notice must be given months prior to the expiration of the lease.

"The plaintiff entered into a contract with the defendant whereby the plaintiff was to build and supply a ready to move home (""RTM"") placed on basement. The plaintiff alleged the contract price stipulated in the agreement was in error and commenced rectification of the contract. HELD: The plaintiff's claim for interest was dismissed. The defendant's evidence was not clear as to when an interest rate of 15% wasinserted into the document and the nature of the evidence must be clear and convincing. The Court cannot accept the plaintiff'sversion of events.  1) The plaintiff was aware that an RTM does not come with a basement and that there was a common intention or agreement as to the terms of the agreement. 2) The defendant knew that the plaintiff wanted a price for the RTM and basement. There was no agreement between the parties to pay interest. 3) When further details of the purchase price were inserted into paragraph 4(d) and (e) at a later date and initialed by Mrs. Batiuk, no interest was called for as there was no indication that the price would not be paid in full.  4) With respect to costs, while the plaintiff has obtained judgment for the extras, this was never in dispute and was admitted by the defendants in their statement of defence. The real issue was the claim for rectification. The defendants shall be entitled to costs of the extras.",The plaintiff was to build and supply to the defendants a ready to move home (RTM). The plaintiff alleged the contract price was in error and sought rectification of the contract. The commissioned salesman who was examined as the proper officer of the plaintiff gave evidence at the examination for discovery that he did not communicate the prices listed on his pricing sheet to the defendants but was adamant at trial that he had. HELD: The claim for rectification was dismissed. 1)The testimony of the president and general manager was not accepted. He signed the company's standard agreement which indicated that the price of the basement was included in the agreement. The salesman's evidence that he provided an approximate price contradicted his own notations and the notation was consistent with the evidence of the defendants.  2)A party seeking rectification must establish that the parties were of one mind as to the terms of the contract and the written record does not properly record that common intention. 3)The evidence was not clear as to when an interest rate of 15% was inserted into the document and the court was not satisfied that there was an agreement to pay interest.

"Interlocutory injunctions are an extraordinary remedy and thus it is incumbent upon the applicant to demonstrate a prima facie case or even a serious issue to be tried that it was in law entitled to more than two weeks notice or that the respondents were in breach of any right which accrued to Danka.

There was no evidence of competition or solicitation by the respondent employees so as to support the quia timet injunction. 3)The injunctive relief taken as a whole seeks to enforce certain restrictive covenants, restrain employees from competitive activity pending the expiration of reasonable notice periods and generally restrain all respondents from any direct or indirect dealings with customers of Danka or pertaining to equipment sold or leased by Danka Canada Inc.  4)Reliance quia tari, 1997 C.L.R. 55 (SCC), [1894] A.C. 541, [1955] T.W.P. 1)It is an important public interest in discouraging restraints on trade, and maintaining a free and open competition unencumbered by the fetters of restrictive clauses. Relief quia time requires the application to establish a strong primae case of imminent danger of substantial damage. Danka accepted the resignations without protest or comment. The submission by the applicant that despite its ejection of the employees from its premises they remained employees is neither surprising nor unusual given the time constraints placed on applicants seeking such relief and the factual nature of the circumstances.","The plaintiff employer sought injunctive relief and sought to enforce certain restrictive covenants and to restrain employees from competitive activity pending the expiration of reasonable notice periods and generally restrain all respondents from any dealings with customers of the plaintiff or pertaining to equipment sold or leased to customers by the plaintiff. HELD: By fiat of December 5, 2003, the Court dismissed the application for injunctive relief with reasons to follow. These are those reasons. 1) The wrongs the plaintiff says it will suffer at the hands of the defendant employees result from the decision of the defendant to expand its business from one dealing with educational supplies, office products and furniture to one involving the supply and service of business machines. The new direction brings the defendants into direct competition with the plaintiff's business. 2) The defendants hired Garry Huntington once his non-competition agreement with the plaintiff expired.

"HELD: The application was dismissed. The court found that the information put forward by the respondent on which to direct an assessment of six years of legal services was not reliable and there were no properly supported allegations of misrepresentation, fraud or dereliction of duty by the applicant. The respondent was correct in concluding that the period of non-payment was within the 30 day time period provided by s. 67 of the Act. The application should have been extended. The applicant was not disadvantaged in that the respondent's request was based on fact, rather than conjecture, as was the case in many other recent applications. The fact that the applicant had not taken the opportunity to assess her billings during this time period was not a reason to extend the time for the assessment.","HELD: The application was dismissed. The court held that the request for an assessment was not fair to the defendant and would not be in the interests of justice. The court reviewed the factors set out in Machula v. Kuse and found that the applicant had failed to provide the specific information required to direct an assessment of six years of legal services covering a multitude of issues on a substantial number of files. The court distinguished the applicant from the case of Vo v. Phillips Legal Profession Corp. because the defendant was not an unsophisticated client. The length of time was unusual, which would further support the need for clearly outlined reasons to justify going back six years. Further, the applicant had not made any complaints to the defendant even during the post-election period and had assured him that he would be paid. The defendant would be severely prejudiced by the assessment requested because of the time that it would take him from his practice to review six years of billings on hundreds of attendances.

"The appellant was convicted of sexually assaulting his stepdaughter. The complainant testified that she had been sexually assaulted at his residence on a number of occasions. The Crown called a counsellor who testified that the girl had been home every Friday night with the appellant. Dismissing the appeal, that the trial judge erred in law in allowing such evidence and as treating it as relevant to the complainant's credibility if, in fact that is what he actually did. The question then was whether the admission of the hearsay evidence was an error so grave as to call for a quashing of the conviction. HELD: The appeal was dismissed. 1)The medical evidence established beyond doubt that the complainant had been the victim of repeated acts of both vaginal and anal intercourse. The only issue therefore was the identity of the person who had committed such sexual assaults. The trial judge found that the evidence had been consistent throughout and had been given in a reasonable manner 'worthy of belief'. 2)The trial judge was aware that any evidence that could be categorized as 'oath helping' was not to be considered. The admission of hearsay was therefore an error that would have been fatal to the conviction, as it did not go to the credibility of young children.","Where a child's testimony as to repeated acts of sexual assault was not accurate as to precise details of the time and place of the events, but was otherwise reasonable and consistent, the inexactitude did not destroy the child's credibility. Evidence of an expert specializing in recognizing symptoms of child sexual abuse was admissible evidence to assist the trial judge in assessing whether an assault took place. However, evidence of the complainant's school counsellor was inadmissible as hearsay, but notwithstanding, its admission was not so grave an error as to call for a quashing of the conviction.

"The appellant, who stole his grandmother's car from her home and then drove to the Canada-U.S. border station, where he was arrested by border guards for attempting to cross into the US without permission, pleaded guilty to theft of property of a value exceeding $5,000 contrary to s.334 of the Criminal Code. The appellant had been previously sentenced to 5 months imprisonment, 18 months probation and a two year licence suspension. The sentencing judge failed to give sufficient weight to the principle of rehabilitation. The father appealed on the grounds that the sentencing judge did not take sufficient weight from the appellant's past and present substance use. Appeal allowed; sentence set aside; the appellant given leave to appeal. The affidavit filed by the father was not of significant probative value and the father's statements made in the pre-sentence report did not appear to have a significant role to play in the appellant rehabilitation process. The evidence presented by the defence was so incomplete that it was difficult to assess the father.","The appellant appealed his sentence of five months in prison to be followed by 18 months probation following his plea of guilty to the theft of his grandmother's car. Crown counsel acknowledged that this type of case would generally attract a suspended sentence with probation but for negative information in the pre-sentence report, which the appellant had not seen prior to sentencing.

"The petitioner obtained an ex parte order under s. 8(1) of The Family Maintenance Act (Family Maintenance Act) which:(a)restrains the Attorney General of Canada from releasing or paying any monies to the petitioner and from any solicitors in relation to the respondent's claim in Queen's Bench Action No. 2270/97, J.C. Regina (the 'Action'), pending the petitioner's application or further court order; and(b)restrorbs the respondent from disposing of any of the monies that he has received or may receive in relation the Action or any claim against the Attorney-General of Canada pending his application or any court order.HELD: The respondent argued that a restraining order granted pursuant s. of the Act is a preservation of property order and should not be granted because the petitioner has not met the tests that govern the granting of such orders. He argued that the criteria for granting a preservation order are identical to those that must be considered in an application for an interlocutory injunction. The Court reviewed the wording of s. 55 of The Enforcement of Maintenance Orders Act (EMMA) and found that the jurisprudence with respect to injunctive remedies based on inherent or equitable jurisdiction of the court applies to an application under the Act. HELD: 1)The respondent's personal claim for damages in the Action is the only asset that might give him an ability to satisfy the claim under the act that has been made by the petitioner on behalf of herself and the children. Likewise, the ex partee order is lifted as against the attorney-general. 2)The amount of money set aside was purely arbitrary and could not be raised based on evidence available at the time of such application. The amount of notice which may be served may be reserved for the judge presiding over any hearing on the application or a motion to lift the restraining order which was made pursuant to s. 5 of the FAMMA.  3)The Court reviewed whether the criteria set out in s.55 of the Family Maintenance act (the “Act”) were meant to be the same as those applicable to restraining orders in other jurisdictions. The criteria for the preservation order were identical in that if the entire proceeds from the Action were disposed of, the petitioner’s claim would be impaired or defeated. However, if the Action results in between $100,000 to $143,500, as hoped for by the respondent, it is unlikely that the full amount would be required to satisfy any","The petitioner obtained an ex parte order under the Family Maintenance Act which restrains the Attorney General from paying any money owing under an action in Queen's Bench to the respondent and his solicitor and restraining the respondent from disposing of any monies received in the action. The respondent applies to have the order set aside. The respondent argues that a restraining order under the Act is a preservation of property order and should not be granted because the petitioner has not met the tests that govern the granting of such orders. He submits that the criteria for the granting of a preservation order is the same as for a interlocutory injunction. The respondent argues that before the Court can exercises its discretion and grant an order, is should have some evidence that the party being restrained would defeat a claim under the Act. HELD: The Court is satisfied that the respondent's personal claim for damages is the only asset the he has to satisfy the claim under the Act. Without prejudicing the applicant's claim, the Court will arbitrarily determine that the sum of $40,000 will likely be sufficient security. For the time being, the order will attach to the first $40,000 of funds received by the respondent, if and when any amount becomes payable to him. The parties may apply to vary this amount in future. Costs are reserved to be dealt with on the hearing of the application for maintenance. The Court is not satisfied that the jurisprudence with respect to injunctive remedies based on inherent jurisdiction of the court applies to an application under s.8 of the Act. If the criteria for granting a restraining order under the Act were meant to be the same, there would be no need for the unique provision of the Act. As s.8 was enacted to provide a solution where none had existed, the Court must primarily look to the statute itself for a determination of the appropriate considerations. Section 8 of the Act grants the Court the authority to restrain the disposition of assets and creates a new, but limited, form of injunctive relief with this remedy being available solely to prevent the impairment or defeat of the Act. The statute does not require the Court to be satisfied that the respondent is hindering or defeating a claim.

"The wife brought an application pursuant to Rule 14.25 to strike out the husband's application for a variation in relation to spousal support and a retroactive child support order. She sought declaratory relief, exemplary or punitive damages and costs. The husband had previously filed an application for consolidation so that one hearing would be possible. The wife's application sought to strike or amend the husband’s application for child support. HELD: The application was dismissed. The court found that the husband had complied with his child support obligation as set out in the corollary relief judgment and there was nothing to enforce. The only change in circumstances since the signing of the agreement was that the wife had agreed to pay child support based on the information contained in the loan agreement. There was no evidence that this agreement had materially changed since the date of the loans. It was also clear that neither the wife nor the husband treated these obligations as child support and that neither of them declared it as income. The applicant had not been required to pay any of the outstanding debts. The indemnity agreement may be something that could be relied on as a promise made to the wife in the event that she was called on to pay the balance of the Federal Plus loans. The parties had entered into an agreement that the loans would be repaid in full by the wife. There were no exigent circumstances to justify the retroactive order.","The husband applied to have the wife's application for retroactive child support to cover the costs of the child's post-secondary education struck as a matter more properly addressed as an issue of contract. In addition to the child support ordered in the Corollary Relief Judgment, the husband had signed a document in which he agreed to repay the costs of the daughter's American student loans (which had to be obtained in the wife's name as the wife was an American). The wife had also brought a separate action suing the husband in contract to enforce this obligation. Application granted; wife's application for retroactive child support struck as 'frivolous'.

"FIAT: The applicant has not made an issue for trial to prove the 2013 will in solemn form. HELD: The application is dismissed. 1) The Court was satisfied that the applicant had not made out a genuine issue for a trial to determine the will in viva voce form. 2) The test in Quaintance is based on a rebuttable presumption. Where there is an evidentiary burden on a witness, it is necessary only to satisfy the court that there is a genuine issues to be tried, such as lack of testamentary capacity or undue influence or lack of mental capacity. 3) The court reviewed the authorities and found that the threshold for the challenge was reasonably low. The Court found that it was appropriate to review the authorities because of the conflicting accounts of the parties. 4) The evidence did not support the idea that a trial was warranted. The evidence was found to be inconsistent and unreliable. 5) The Act did not provide an evidential burden on the witness.","Wills and Estates – Proof of Will in Solemn FormWills and Estates – Testamentary Capacity After the death of the testator, one of his five daughters brought an application for an order directing a trial to prove the testator’s 2013 will in solemn form on the ground that the testator did not have testamentary capacity to understand the nature of the document he was signing or the extent of his property. The testator and his wife had executed mirror wills in 2012. His wife died in September 2013, and within two days of her death the testator had signed a new will. It was based on his first will with some revisions. The value of the estate was approximately $343,000 and the will made bequests of $100 to the applicant and another daughter. The testator left the rest and residue of the estate divided into equal shares between his three other daughters. The applicant deposed that at the time the testator’s wife was dying, she visited him and found him to be very confused. When the testator’s lawyer came to meet with him as his wife was dying, the applicant stated that the testator said he did not remember the lawyer and would not sign anything. The only other evidence submitted by the applicant was a letter from the testator’s physician, who reported that he saw the testator in early September 2012 and that he was then alert and could recognize him. The evidence presented by the two daughters who were named as executors of the will consisted of their own affidavits and the affidavits of a friend of the testator; a bank official who had prepared a power of attorney for the testator made at the time of the death of his wife; and the lawyer who prepared the original 2012 wills and the 2013 will. The contents of the various affidavits deposed to the testator’s estranged relationship with the applicant and her sister, his intention to exclude the applicant from his will, and that he appeared to be mentally capable. The lawyer’s affidavit deposed that at the initial meeting that she attended with the testator when his wife was dying, he was devastated by grief and she did not take any instructions. When she met with him again to take instructions regarding his new will, she kept notes of them—the testator had expressly instructed her to make sure that the two daughters would get nothing except for the specific bequests. The lawyer confirmed that she had no concerns with the testator’s capacity. HELD: The application was dismissed. The court held that the applicant’s evidence in support of the challenge to the will was extremely thin and the descriptions of the testator’s behaviour did not raise doubt regarding his capacity regarding his property and his disposition of it. The other affidavits presented uncontradicted evidence of the testator’s undiminished mental capacity.",6_2015skqb138.txt,"After the death of the testator, one of his five daughters brought an application for an order directing a trial to prove the testator’s 2013 will in solemn form on the ground that the testator did not have testamentary capacity to understand the nature of the document he was signing or the extent of his property.

"The applicant sought an order in the nature of mandamus to compel the respondent to comply with an order of the Income Assistance Appeal Board. The applicant was disabled and had been recipient of income assistance for approximately 5 years. His application was terminated due to failure to disclose requested information. In 2006 he re-applied for income assistance but was denied on the basis that he failed to provide requested information (the Appeal Board had found that the applicant was a person in need). The applicant appealed the decision and the appeal was heard by the Assistance Appeal board. The Board allowed the appeal and found that applicant was 'a person in Need' as defined in the Employment Support and Income Assistance Act. The board ordered that his assistance was to be effective the date he was assessed. The application for an order under mandamus was granted. The court found that there was a clear legal right established to have the decision of the Appeal Board enforced. The respondent had a duty to act pursuant to the regulations and had no discretion to make decisions which were not binding generally or as to the time period effected. If the respondent had the right to ignore decisions of the Board, the Appeal board's function would be meaningless.","The applicant applied under the Civil Procedure Rules (1972) for an order of mandamus compelling the respondent department to comply with a prior order of the Income Assistance Appeal Board. The applicant was denied income assistance for failure to supply requested information. He appealed the decision and the appeal board ordered his income assistance be reinstated. The respondent refused to reinstate assistance and made a request for additional information. Eventually, the applicant supplied the requested information and his assistance was reinstated. He sought retroactive amounts for the period falling between the appeal board's order and the time of reinstatement. Order granted, costs to the applicant in the amount of $750: assistance to be reinstated retroactively according to the time frame ordered by the appeal board.

"The applicant is 39 years old licensed practical nurse who is employed with the Mamawetan Health Region. She is married to a self-employed carpenter who also lives in La Ronge. They are the biological parents of three children. The applicant commenced a petition in October 2008 in which she claims relief under The Family Property Act, S.S. 1997, The Children's Law Act, 1997, and Family Maintenance Act 1997. HELD: The application for interim relief is dismissed. A modest transfer of funds from the respondent to the applicant should alleviate the majority of her negative cash flow problem. A spousal support payment of $1,500 per month is ordered for a total of eight months. The Court has not established a prima facie case that the respondent stood in loco parentis to the children.  1) The fact that one is not the biological parent of child does not necessarily mean that one may not be legally required to provide financial support for that child. However, given the short-term relationship and to add impetus to having the issues resolved sooner rather than later, the Court ordered these payments be paid. 2) There is no dispute that the petitioner and the respondent cohabited for in excess of 2 years and that she is a'spouse' by virtue of the definition in the Act. However the fact that the parties lived together and had the opportunity to travel together for many years does not mean that the Court cannot order an interim distribution of matrimonial property in favor of the petitioner. It is only in the short term that the issues can be resolved. Given the short time relationship and the petitioner's significant income and cohabitation with the respondent, it can only be described as short term. 3) The respondent has the ability to pay spousals in the amount of $20,000. 4) The issues to be determined are: 1) Has the petitioner established that her status as spouse within the meaning of the Family Maintenance act, 1997; the appropriate amount of child support, base and s. 7, that ought to be paid and should be sufficient to relieve her from some of the economic hardship that she has been experiencing as a result of the breakdown of the Spousal relationship.

The petitioner and the respondent began cohabitating sometime between November 2002 (according to her) and September 2003 (according to him). They separated in July 2008. The petitioner now commences a petition in which she claims relief from the respondent, Dr. Hunt, under The Family Property Act, The Children's Law Act, 1997 and The Family Maintenance Act, 1997. The three issues to be determined on this application are whether the petitioner has established a prima facie case that the respondent stood in loco parentis to the children such as to justify an interim child support order, whether the petitioner has established that she is entitled to interim spousal support and whether the Court should order an interim distribution of matrimonial property in favour of the petitioner in the amount of $20,000. HELD: 1) The petitioner has fallen short of establishing a prima facie case that the respondent stood in loco parentis to the children. The Court cannot make a determination based on conflicting affidavits.

The petitioner has annual income of over $71,000.

"The sole issue before the court was whether any additional dependant child care benefits were payable under s. 146(5) of The Automobile Accident Insurance Act when the deceased victim was unemployed and had no income at the time of the fatal motor vehicle accident. HELD: The children were not entitled to any additional benefits. The sole issue on appeal was whether these extra dependant benefits were available under s146(5). The deceased was not entitled in 1998 to any extra benefits and had been unemployed for 6 months prior to the accident. She was not employed and would not have become entitled to an income within six months if she had survived. As there was no surviving spouse the children were entitled to death benefit under s145(5), which was the amount payable as death benefit.

The guardian appealed SGI's decision that the children were not entitled to any additional benefits. She argued that since the money paid was in relation to the youngest child, who in the circumstances took the place of a surviving spouse, the death benefit becomes fixed at $47,427, and the formula used in s.146(1) would be half of the income replacement benefit(the IRB) that the deceased would have been entitled to had she survived the accident. Accordingly the IRB to be used in s.246(5) should be $94,854. The sole issue was whether any additional child care benefits were payable under s.146(5) when the deceased was unemployed and had no income at the time of the fatal motor vehicle accident. HELD: The appeal was dismissed without order as to costs. Where the deceased victim would not have been entitled to any benefit had she survived the accident, the minimum death benefit is still payable, but that amount does not become a factor in calculating the IRB for the purpose of applying the formula contained in s.146(5). It is the total amount payable as a death benefit. The IRB in this case was zero and the amount payable pursuant to the formula in either s.146(1) or s.146(5) is zero.

"FIAT. By fiat of December 5, 2002, Gerein C.J. authorized the initiation of a derivative action by Dale Henry on behalf of 609. The defendants in the action were entitled to examine a representative of the plaintiff for discovery and that Henry was obliged to appoint counsel for the plaintiff. The question posed was whether there was any right of privilege as between 609 and Henry; if so, how is it claimed and are such documents privileged as between the Plaintiff and Defendants? Who is responsible for the cost of production of any documents? HELD: 1) As a corporation may only litigate with legal representation, Henry is empowered and obliged to appointed counsel for 609 as Henry is obliged to advance the corporate interests in the derivative action. Whether that counsel is Mr. Brehon, another member of his firm or someone from outside that firm is entirely matter for Henry. Such counsel is entitled to access to the relevant documents, records and employees for the purposes of the action, including preparation of a statement as to documents and following the modified discovery process set out in my earlier fiat.

In September 2004, clarification of the May 27 2004 fiat was sought. HELD: The questions raised by the parties together with the disparate positions taken by the participants demonstrate the confusion as to the nature of the action and of a party's rights and responsibilities within the action. The action is a derivative one in which the action by plaintiff, 609, proceeds for the benefit of 609 against those it alleges to have caused it loss or damage. Henry is empowered and obliged to appoint counsel for 609. Such counsel is entitled to have access to the relevant documents, records and employees for the purposes of the action. It follows that Henry and that counsel have professional and fiduciary obligations to 609. Henry's overall instructions to counsel should not be in conflict with the interests of 609 as Henry is obliged to advance the corporate interests in the derivative action. As no formal motion was brought in this proceeding and the matter proceeded with all parties consenting, there shall be no order as to costs. Henceforth, it is the plaintiff and the defendants, who have status in these proceedings, and not Henry, in his personal capacity, or the board of directors of 609.",2_2004skqb498.txt,"By fiat of May 27 2004, the Court ruled that the defendants in the action were entitled to examine for discovery a representative of 609 and that Henry was obliged to appoint counsel for 609 in the action. In September 2004, clarification of the May 27 2004 fiat was sought. HELD: The questions raised by the parties together with the disparate positions taken by the participants demonstrate the confusion as to the nature of the action and of a party's rights and responsibilities within the action. Henry is empowered and obliged to appoint counsel for 609. Such counsel is entitled to have access to the relevant documents, records and employees for the purposes of the action. It follows that Henry and that counsel have professional and fiduciary obligations to 609. Henceforth, it is the plaintiff and the defendants, who have status in these proceedings, and not Henry, in his personal capacity, or the board of directors of 609."
"The applicant sought an order in the nature of certiorari (pursuant to Rule 58 and s. 482(3)(c) of the Criminal Code) relating to the issuance of a search warrant on May 3, 2005. The search warrant alleged that the accountant filed fraudulent T4 and created false T4 income in order to obtain a tax refund, and misreported HST sales. An earlier Information, sworn in April 2005, had been referred to as a prior search warrant. The applicant claimed the information contained incomplete and misleading information and that the learned Justice of the Peace erred in concluding that the necessary grounds existed for the search. In light of his clear statement on cross-examination, the applicant said he would not have pursued a warrant without the information provided by the informant. He also claimed that there was a reasonable apprehension of bias because he had previously acted in a solicitor/client relationship with the spouse of the applicant. HELD: The application was dismissed with costs.  1) The informant did not say he would have sought the warrant in the absence of the defective paragraphs but only that he would be more comfortable omitting information that he now knows to be erroneous.  2) The nature of the breach of the rules of natural justice is not difficult to understand. Judicially interpreted, the standard is one of credibly based probability. Mere suspicion, conjecture, hypothesis or 'fishing expeditions' fall short of the minimally acceptable standard from both common law and constitutional perspective. Once the allegation of misleading and inaccurate HST reporting is removed, the substance of the Information rests upon the handwritten T4 submitted by the applicant that did not appear to be reconciled with the company payroll. Without denying the potential seriousness of these allegations, they rise above the level of'suspicion' to make out reasonable and probable grounds for a warrant to search the applicant's (and his) home.","The accused applied to quash a search warrant, which authorized the search and seizure of his accounting records for a two-year period. The warrant alleged that the accused, an accountant who ran his business out of his home, filed a fraudulent T4 and created false T4 income in order to obtain a tax refund and misreported HST sales. Although the correct information was contained in the informant's file, there were two errors made in the Information to Obtain the warrant; the Crown argued that the errors were inadvertent and not intended to deceive the Justice and that the things to be searched for had relevance beyond the discrepancies. The applicant also argued that the issuing Justice should have recused himself due to being in a conflict of interest situation from having provided independent legal advice to the applicant's wife in respect of a mortgage transaction approximately seven years ago and later being consulted by the wife when the parties were experiencing marital difficulties. Application to quash the warrant allowed on the basis that there were not reasonable and probable grounds for its issuance; there was no reasonable apprehension of bias on behalf of the Justice. The court drew the inference that the informant would not have pursued the warrant without the undisputed and seriously erroneous information and noted that these errors occurred despite the presence of contrary information in the informant's file. There was no evidence as to what information the wife had imparted to the Justice in their previous encounters; the oath sworn by the Justice and the fact that the last time the Justice represented the wife was approximately five years prior to the issuance of the warrant militated against a reasonable person having an apprehension of bias.",d_2006nssc280.txt,"The accused applied to quash a search warrant, which authorized the search and seizure of his accounting records for a two-year period.

"The defendant AGC moved for summary judgment on the pleadings on the grounds that the plaintiff had a cause of action arising from the statutory undertakings given by the AGC in 1996. The AGC argued that notwithstanding finding a Cause of Action, the plaintiff's amended statement of claim did not plead sufficient material facts to comply with the rules. The statement of claims was based on an undertaking to respond in damages and costs and did not disclose any supporting details. It was also argued that the amendments did not add anything to the statement of action. The defendant argued that there was nothing novel about his action given it was rooted in legislation. He argued that he had been convicted of conspiracy to traffic and sentenced to 7 years imprisonment and that the Crown did not push the matter all the way to forfeiture and, instead, returned it to him in 2004. HELD: The application was dismissed with costs.  1) There is no evidence that the undertaking gives rise to a claim other than by way of attack on the making or execution of the special warrant or restraint order. While this is a significant factor, it does not necessarily defend against this summary judgment application based on the plea. 2) The amended Statement of Claim does not add nothing to the Statement of claim that was before Justice LeBlanc.","Rule 13.03 – Summary judgment on pleadings, motion granted on the basis of Rule 13.03(1)(c)).

"LaserWorks, a dealer in supplies for laser printers, made a proposal to its creditors under the Bankruptcy and Insolvency Act. A competitor, Datarite, operating through the appellant, acquired the claims of eighteen creditors and voted them over the objections of LaserWorks at a creditors meeting. Only two of the remaining sixteen creditors opposed the proposal. LaserWorks appealed. Dismissing the appeal, that while there had been collusion by the creditors sufficient to deprive them of the right to vote, the Registrar did not err in concluding that the claims were assigned by the appellant to the appellant and that its purpose was to remove a competitor from the market. It was not necessary for the court to substitute its discretion for that of the Registrar.","The respondent made a proposal to its creditors under the provisions of the Bankruptcy Act.

"The appellants pleaded guilty to fraud over $5000 and were sentenced to two (2) years probation and restitution of one-half of the amount of the fraud. The Crown and defence advanced a joint sentencing recommendation for two (1)years probation, restitution in the full amount of overpayment and two (half) years of probation respectively. The decision to appeal the judge's sentencing recommendation was a fit sentence. While the agreement between counsel and the judge was not binding on the judge, the joint recommendation made to him was a fitting sentence. The appellants applied for leave and, if granted, appealed the decision to order restitution of the full sum rather than one half as submitted in the joint recommendations. HELD: Leave to appeal was granted and the appeal was allowed. The sentence was set aside and the restitution orders were amended by reducing the amount ordered to be repaid by one half to $32,866.","The appellants pled guilty to theft over $5,000.

"The plaintiff claims damages against the defendant for breach of contract whereby the plaintiff was to supply electricians to perform work at its potash mine at Rocanville, Saskatchewan. The plaintiff also claims damages for the defendant's breach of an employment contract when Sullivan was employed by the plaintiff to perform services for PCS. Sullivan was not in a managerial position with the plaintiff and did not possess any confidential information or trade secrets. He knew nothing as to profit margins, etc. of the plaintiff. During the period in question, the employer was deriving benefit from both his employer and from a competitor. This constitutes a breach of his contract of employment. The only remaining issue is whether Sullivan breached his duty of fidelity by submitting a proposal to PCS when he was still employed. HELD: The plaintiff is awarded $500. The defendant was found to be entitled to costs against the plaintiff, and $500 awarded against him. 1) The law is well settled that an employee is under an implied obligation not to compete with an employer during the term of his or her employment. There is nothing that Restauronics can complain of in this case. 2) The trial judge erred in fact in characterizing the plaintiff's actions as mere preparation. She competed with her employer for business which had been the employer's. Her placing of the bid went beyond preparation. 3) The plaintiff was awarded no more than nominal damages.","The plaintiff claims damages against the defendants Tim Sullivan and Sullivan Instrumentation (collectively 'Sullivan') for breach of an employment contract when Sullivan was employed by the plaintiff to perform services for PCS at the mine. The issue is whether Sullivan breached his employment contract by submitting a proposal to PCS when he was still employed by the plaintiff. HELD: 1) There is nothing wrong with Sullivan setting up his corporation with a view to starting a competitive business after his employment with the plaintiff ended. An employee must be free to plan his future after his employment with his employer ends. He did not prepare the proposals during working hours. He prepared them with the assistance of his wife, when he was off work in Regina. However, it has been held that an employee who submitted a bid in competition to his or her employer during a period of working notice was in breach of the employment contract. Therefore, Sullivan breached his duty of fidelity to the plaintiff. 2) However, the Court was not satisfied that the plaintiff proved it would have been in a position to perform further work for PCS if Sullivan had not submitted a proposal. There were no union members available for it to hire. It had no employees ready to perform the contract. It would appear the plaintiff had abandoned any thought of continuing the contract until the end of December. If he had pulled employees from another contract, he would have suffered no damage. 3) Sullivan was not in a managerial position with the plaintiff. He did not possess any confidential information or trade secrets. He knew nothing as to the profit margins of the plaintiff. He did have business experience but not confidential information or a trade secret. 4) The plaintiff in this case is entitled to no more than nominal damages in the amount of $500 plus costs.",4_2007skqb397.txt,"The plaintiff claims damages against the defendants Tim Sullivan and Sullivan Instrumentation (collectively 'Sullivan') for breach of an employment contract when Sullivan was employed by the plaintiff to perform services for PCS at the mine.

"The applicants are defendants in an action commenced by the respondent University of Saskatchewan. They applied to have the University's claim against them dismissed for want of prosecution but were unsuccessful. HELD: Leave to appeal was granted. The court found that the delay from 1991 to 1998 (when the university's insurer was prosecuting the action) was not problematic. However, the reason for the delay was because the university had not obtained an appointment for the examination for discovery until 1997. As result, the university did not assume control of the action in issue here until 1998. The issue of merits was found to be well known and there was enough merit in their position to warrant granting leave.","The applicants applied for leave to appeal from a Chambers decision denying their application to dismiss the respondent's claim against them for want of prosecution. The applicants were partners in an architecture firm that provided design drawing and specifications for the construction of the Education Building at the University of Saskatchewan. The building was substantially completed in 1970. In 1985, stone panels fell off the exterior of the building. In 1986 the respondent commenced an action against its insurer for coverage of the loss. In 1991, the insurer commenced an action against the applicants in order to preserve the respondent's right to relief. In 1997, the Court determined the respondent was not entitled to coverage from its insurer. The respondent commenced control over the litigation against the applicant in 1997. Between 1997 and 2010, documents were exchanged, discoveries were held and an unsuccessful settlement negotiation was held. In 2010 all of the defendants applied to have the respondent's claim dismissed for want of prosecution. The Chambers judge struck the claims against all the defendants except the applicant. HELD: Leave to appeal was granted because there was some merit to the applicant's arguments that they had been treated inconsistently and that key witnesses were no longer available to testify because of death or mental or physical disability, which would prejudice the applicant.

However, it is clear from the evidence that the made a conscious decision to consult with Legal Aid and, by implication, did not wish to pursue his first course of action. In this situation there was no obligation on the police officer to provide the accused with a warning. The officer was justified in assuming that he was satisfied. 1)There was no breach of the defence's right to counsel.

Accordingly, the officer was rational in assuming he was content. 3)The destruction of vial evidence did have no relevance to the accused in making his full answer and defence.  4)The evidence was clean and the accused did have a reasonable chance of making a full answer to the Court.

After the call was completed, the accused asked the officer if they had got the dumbest lawyer they could find. The officer asked the accused if he was satisfied with his call and he said 'sure.'

"HELD: The court found that the respondent was a person within the meaning of s. 4(2) of The Family Maintenance Act, 1997 and that he had had that status on a continuing basis to the present time. The respondent had made an application for ongoing child maintenance based on the Federal Child Support Guidelines commencing September 2005. The petitioner was only 19 years of age and had been diligently pursuing his education. He was entitled to student loans and he was to be reimbursed for any payments made subsequent to that date. On the basis of the respondent's income, the amount of child support was reduced from $200 per month to $181 per month as the respondent had changed his course of study in 2001 to include a reduction in his hours of work due to a change in employment.

"The petitioner sought a distribution of family property in accordance with the Family Property Act. The parties lived on an acreage and rented farm land. They carried on a mixed farming operation. The respondent did the farm work with the petitioner providing assistance. In 1996, the respondent purchased a large tractor and farm machinery. Over a period of time, the farm machinery was purchased and the sale proceeds were used to purchase the acreage. HELD: 1) The farm machinery comprises major portion of the family property. It is here that there is a serious dispute in respect to what pieces of machinery constitute family property; what exemptions are available to the respondent; and what value should be attributed to the equipment which is subject to distribution. 2) The respondent claims that he owned several machines and tools prior to the marriage. Over the years he has owned and operated several machines, including a tractor and a J.D. 400 mix mill. The petitioner received no benefit from these expenses. Accordingly, she should bear no responsibility for the payments made and the value of the snowmobile fixed at $800. 3) There is a claim for $16,500 which is said to be owing to the father for the Versatile 160 tractor. The Court found that the father owned the tractor and that it was subject to the distribution. 4) The petitioner shall have three months to pay the amount of the judgment. 5) The interest earned would not be exempt but the petitioner may apply to this court for directions as to sale of the Family property including the family home. In the circumstances, the Court treated the machinery as being family property and did not take it into account. 6) The Court awarded judgment against the respondent in the sum of $51,725.82 together with taxable costs of the action.","The wife sought distribution of family property in accordance with the Family Property Act. HELD: The petitioner was given judgment for $51,725.82 with taxable costs of the action payable within 3 months, failing which, the petitioner may apply for directions as to sale of the family property. The family property was divided equally from the date the action was commenced. The legislation does not permit an exemption in the circumstances for the $12,000 from the sale of the respondent's trailer used to purchase the acreage. It was concluded the respondent's father owned the tractor. Two other tractors were exempt and a partial exemption was allowed for a snowmobile and some tools. While he owned a truck prior to the marriage, it could not be traced to the current truck. The petitioner's automobile and boat were added to the distribution value of the machinery. There were no records of the value of the pigs. Whatever the number brought into the marriage, it had been reduced by the sale of the animals. The value of livestock to be distributed was $25,261.

"The respondent, resident of Manitoba, was convicted of having in his possession controlled substance for the purpose of trafficking contrary to s. 5(2) of the Controlled Drugs and Substances Act. He was sentenced to nine months with a 10 year firearms prohibition. The offence took place in Yorkton. The sentencing judge refused to order forfeiture of the truck, which was owned by the respondent and paid for through a loan from his parents. The trial judge found that 'basically all of the money' to pay for the truck came from the parents' bank account but they had registered no lien to protect their interests. The father was depressed and remorseful. HELD: The appeal was allowed. The sentence was set aside and the truck was ordered forfeited. 1) The Court found that the sentence imposed was at the very low end of the range but there was no basis for interfering with the sentence.  2) It is clear the truck is 'offence-related property' in that it was used in connection with the commission of a designated substance offence and was of small-time nature. The Crown put a street value of between $2000 and $2000 with the respondent valuing the drugs at slightly under $2000. 3) There is no reference to proportionality in regard to personal property and it is only in regard totals 18 to 19.1 that the judge can take into account the impact of an order of forfeiture and whether it is proportionate to the nature and gravity of the offence, the circumstances surrounding the commission or the criminal record of the person charged or convicted. The Court may order in its discretion that the property be returned to the innocent person.","The respondent was convicted of having in his possession a controlled substance for the purpose of trafficking contrary to s. 5(2) of the Controlled Drugs and Substances Act (CDSA) and was sentenced to a term of incarceration of 9 months with a 10 year firearms prohibition.

The sentencing judge found the truck was not 'integral to the offence.' HELD: The Crown is granted leave to appeal. 1) The appeal against the length of sentence is dismissed. 2) The appeal of the failure to order forfeiture of the truck is allowed. The truck is ordered forfeited. 1) Although the sentence imposed was at the very low end of the range, in these circumstances, there is no basis for interfering with it.  2) Upon conviction, the first step the trial judge ought to have taken was to determine whether the property was 'offence-related property' within the meaning of the CDSA. It is clear the truck is 'offence-related property' in that it was used in connection with the commission of a designated substance offence. The sentencing judge failed to consider the definition in the CDSA. Section 19 of the CDSA allows innocent parties who have a valid interest in property to apply for an order of restoration. However, the innocent party must be either the lawful owner or lawfully entitled to possession of the property which would otherwise be forfeited. The Court may order in its discretion that the property be returned to the innocent person. In this case, the vehicle was owned by the respondent and the parents are not lawfully entitled to its possession.

"The Workers' Compensation Appeals Tribunal (WCAT) upheld the appellant's claim for gradual onset stress. The appellant argued that the policy was wrong to exclude certain workplace events and stressors from an objective point of view. The appeal turned on one main issue: whether the policy should be applied to the decisions relating to the worker's gradual onset trauma claim. The issue was whether the Policy applied too restrictive a test. The respondent appealed. Appeal dismissed; WCAT did not err in not giving weight to the opinion of the Workers’ Compensation Board’s treating psychologist; nor was it wrong to rely on the respondent’ s. 4(1)(a)(i) policy in determining the nature of the workplace stressors. The only conclusion drawn was that there were no unusual and excessive stressors in the workplace. The policy set out the conditions under which each type of stress is compensable under GECA; the policy did not require an objective approach to the workplace; and, in the absence of such an approach, the Court could not find that the Policy was fundamentally restrictive.","The worker was unsuccessful in his claim for compensation for gradual onset stress when the Workers' Compensation Appeal Tribunal (WCAT) found that the conditions in his workplace did not constitute unusual or excessive stressors as required under the terms of the relevant Board policy.

Appeal dismissed; the WCAT correctly applied the objective approach in determining whether there were workplace events or stressors sufficient to support a claim for gradual onset stress.

"Decision in mortgage loss suit. The plaintiff had purchased two insurance policies for the purpose of indemnifying her against one insured company for non-payment of the insurance premium.

When the property was totally destroyed by fire in 1992, the plaintiff, who had been advised of the possible loss, refused to foreclose. She sought solicitor to act on her behalf. Awarding the plaintiff $200,000 for the loss of the other insurance policy, that under the terms of the arrangement the plaintiff should not be denied coverage on the basis of errors made by the insurer, the standard of proof was still on balance of probabilities but on a higher degree of probability, commensurate with the conduct alleged. The court accepted the plaintiff's submission that the insurance policies were in place for the protection of the plaintiff company and that they had been 'underwritten by and for the insured by' by the defendant.","The plaintiff held a mortgage on a house destroyed by a suspicious fire.

"The accused was charged with driving while his ability to operate a motor vehicle was impaired contrary to s. 253(a) of the Criminal Code; having care and control of the vehicle contrary to ss.253(b) and having consumed alcohol in such a quantity that his concentration exceeded 80 milligrams in 100 milliliters of blood contrary to the Criminal code. The accused testified that he was in the passenger seat and crossed to the driver's seat of an idling vehicle to engage the emergency brake and turn off the engine.

It may be speculation to conclude that every driver whose BAC exceeds 80 might change his mind; however, it would be wrong to preclude a trial court from assessing the risk of change of intention, on the facts of the individual case, especially where it is accepted that one effect of the consumption of alcohol is the impairment of judgment. 2)The only issue on which requested briefs from the Crown and Defence was whether or not the Crown had established beyond a reasonable doubt that the accused was in care or control of his motor vehicle at the relevant time.  3)There was little, if any, danger of the car being set in motion unintentionally, or of its thereby becoming a danger to the public.","The defendant was charged with impaired driving and operating a motor vehicle with a blood alcohol content over the legal limit.

"The accused is charged with consuming alcohol in such a quantity that the concentration in his blood exceeded 80 milligrams of alcohol in 100 millilitres of blood contrary to s. 253(1)(b) of the Criminal Code. The Crown entered a stay of proceedings on the other count on the Information, which alleged impaired operation of motor vehicle. HELD: The accused abandoned his Charter application under ss. and thereof. The issue to be determined is whether the accused is able to establish on a balance of probabilities that his rights to counsel under s. 10(b) have been breached, such that the Court should order an exclusion of evidence in accord with s. 24 of the Charter. As well, the Court must determine whether the Crown met any onus on it to establish that the accused had waived his rights.","The accused asserted that his rights to counsel under s. 10(b) of the Charter were breached because the police officer did not bring a list of lawyers to the accused's attention and the accused did not have access to it.

"The accused was charged with three counts in relation to one incident occurring March 20, 1999 at Saskatoon, Saskatchewan: impaired driving contrary to s. 255(1) and 253(a), over.08 contrary to ss. 253(b) and 255(3) and driving while disqualified contrary so s. 259(4), all of Criminal Code of Canada. HELD: The accused was found not guilty of count 2 in the Information. 1) The accused's vehicle was stopped at a controlled intersection. There were two police officers waiting outside the court house. During the wait, the two officers and the accused's driver both got excited and asked the accused what was going on. The accused testified that he was trying to flee the intersection. The officer testified that the accused had been drinking and had been in the truck for about 30 minutes. The conversation between the Crown and Defence witnesses was found to be fabricated and unreliable. The impugned conduct affects only the weight to be given to the evidence of the witnesses notwithstanding the conduct complained of. The right of the defendant to a fair trial was denied. 2) The Court was unable to conclude beyond a reasonable doubt that the first sample was obtained within 2 hours of the accident. There was no bad intent on the part of the officers nor did there be tailoring of the evidence. The Court found that there must be a manifest unfairness in the trial process as a result of the impugning behavior in order for the Crown to find that there has been a breach of fundamental justice. The admission that the Court was not satisfied by the evidence as a whole was accepted. The issue of whether the Court could rely on the Certificate of Analysis and the reading at the time of the collision was resolved. The evidence of whether there was a breach in fundamental justice by virtue of the discussion of police witnesses was not accepted.","Accused charged with impaired driving, being over.08 and driving while disqualified. The charges arose out of an incident where he rear-ended car stopped in front of him at red light. The accident victim estimated the time of the accident to be around 1:30 a.m. After the accident, the victim, witnesses and attending police officers noticed that the accused displayed signs of intoxication. The police arrived at the scene at 2:12 a.m. The accused was seated in the police car and was first spoken to shortly before 3:00 a.m. The officer determined through CPIC that the accused was prohibited from driving in Saskatchewan. The demand for breath sample was made at 2:48 a.m. At 2:50 a.m. he was given his rights and he spoke to lawyer prior to providing sample. HELD: The evidence of the crown witnesses was accepted over that of the defendant. The Court found beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant was the operator of the vehicle when the collision occurred and therefore the accused was found guilty of driving while disqualified. The crown was not able to prove beyond a reasonable doubt the time of the accident and, therefore, is not entitled to rely upon the presumption provided in s.258(1) of the Code. The Court was not able to conclude that the first sample was taken within 2 hours of the incident. On the charge of impaired driving, the Court had no doubt that the accused's ability to operate a motor vehicle was impaired by alcohol. The Court also held that there was no breach of fundamental justice by virtue of the discussion of the police witnesses with the civilian witnesses during the trial. When witness remains in the courtroom after an exclusion order and then testifies, the trial judge may consider this in deciding the weight to be given to the evidence of that witness. This principle is equally applicable to the case at hand where witnesses who had yet to testify discussed the evidence with other witnesses after their testimony. The Court rejected the defence argument that there was an appearance of unfairness about the trial process that requires that a stay of proceedings to be entered. The Court held that there must be manifest unfairness in the trial process as a result of the impugned behaviour in order to find a breach of fundamental justice. Here the impugned conduct only affects the weight to be given to the evidence of the police officers.

There was no tailoring of the evidence as consequence of the discussion. Even if the Court had found breach of fundamental justice, stay would not be appropriate.

"The Trustee in bankruptcy received a voluntary assignment for bankruptcy by the Superintendent of Bankruptcy on September 9, 2005. The Trustee was appointed as trustee of the premises. When the Trustee attended the premises, it was found that the inventory was being loaded into a van and he was unable to gain possession. A consent order was granted directing that the trustee would take possession of the assets which have given rise to the action for the purposes of completing an inventory and liquidating the assets in accordance with the normal duties and powers of the trustee. The trustee was awarded reasonable fees, expenses and disbursements directly associated with the removal and relocation of the property. The application for summary judgment was continued. There was no agreement as to the term of the application.","When the trustee attended at the premises of the bankrupt, he found the bankrupt's inventory being loaded into a van by the landlord; after obtaining a consent order which allowed it to take possession of the assets for the purposes of compiling an inventory, the trustee brought an application for summary judgment against the landlord.

"The appellant was charged on a four count information in connection with an alleged impaired driving incident. He contended the information was nullity because it contravened s. 789(2) of the Criminal Code. The Provincial Court trial judge severed the count which was the source of the difficulty. The appellant sought an order from the Court of Queen's Bench quashing the trial proceedings. That application was dismissed and the appellant appealed. He submitted that the trial judge erred in law in severing the count 4, the charge concerning impaired driving, refusing a breath demand and obstruction. HELD: The appeal was dismissed. The court found that the appellant’s argument could not succeed because of the way in which the court reviewed the information and determined that the defect could only be cured by severing count 4 by way of amendment or severance.","The appellant was charged on a four count information in connection with an alleged impaired driving incident.

The appellant then sought an order from the Court of Queen's Bench quashing the trial proceedings. That application was dismissed and the appellant appealed to this Court. At trial, the appellant made an application for an order quashing the information as being a nullity. He contended it was drafted so as to violate the Code s. 789(2) of which states: 'No information in respect of an offence for which, by reason of previous convictions, a greater punishment may be imposed shall contain any reference to previous convictions.' The trial judge dismissed the application to quash. He held that the defect could be addressed in one of two ways: The drive while disqualified charge could be amended to strike out the words 'by reason of an order pursuant to Section 253 and 254 of the Criminal Code.' Alternatively, he said the defect could be cured if that count was severed. The trial judge advised that he was satisfied he could fairly try the appellant even with knowledge that he had or might have a criminal record. The appellant's application for a writ of certiorari quashing the information was dismissed by the Court of Queen's Bench. In this Court, the appellant did not pursue his argument that the information was a nullity which should have been quashed in its entirety. Rather, he contended that, after recognizing a problem in relation to s. 789(2) of the Code and severing count 4 of the information, the trial judge should have dealt only with that count. More specifically, the appellants contended that an apprehension of bias arose when the judge elected to proceed on the first three counts, i.e. the charges concerning impaired driving, refusing a breath demand and obstruction. This was said to be the case because the judge had learned of a previous conviction in the course of severing the drive while disqualified count. HELD: The appeal is dismissed. The test for apprehension of bias is well settled. The leading case in the criminal context is R. v. S.(R.D.). The test is: what would an informed person, viewing the matter realistically and practically Ã» and having thought the matter through Ã» conclude. It is inevitable that accused persons will appear before judges who know of their criminal histories. The community rightly trusts that such information will play no part in judicial decision making. Accordingly, at least in the normal course, mere knowledge of an accused's criminal record does not automatically disqualify a judge from presiding at a trial. No reasonable apprehension of bias arose by virtue of the trial judge's decision to proceed in relation to the first three counts in the information.",b_2010skca58.txt,"The appellant was charged on a four count information in connection with an alleged impaired driving incident.

"This was an action for damages for wrongful dismissal where the plaintiff contends that she was constructively dismissed without notice by her employer, the defendant. The issues were whether there was constructive dismissal, at what point did the plaintiff have notice of the changes which constituted constructive dismissal? HELD: The appropriate period of notice was 8 months. The plaintiff was awarded damages on the basis of eight months salary at the rate she was receiving at the time of her employment, plus vacation pay of 6% per annum and interest from July 14th to September 14th 1997. 1)It is of course an essential ingredient of constructive dismissal that the employee have absolutely failed to militage. 2)In this case the plaintiff was not only wrongfully dismissed but her employment was terminated. 3)The employer bore the responsibility of clearly informing the employee of proposed changes. This was done without delay. 4)The plaintiff had no notice of these proposed changes until June 1997, which put in process events which led to the constructive dismissal as of July 14. 1997. She was, therefore, wrongfully dismissal. 5)In a wrongful dismissal case a reasonable person in the same situation as the plaintiff would have been expected to accept some of the proposed changes but may have had to lower her sights in order to obtain employment. The employer obviously wanted to get rid of her.","This was an action for wrongful dismissal. The plaintiff went on maternity leave for six months. During this time the defendant, her employer, hired a temporary replacement on a part-time basis, with fewer hours and less pay than the plaintiff. The defendant offered this position to the plaintiff when her leave had ended. She refused, and alleged constructive dismissal without cause. She admitted that the defendant had asked her prior to her leave if her job could be done in less hours, and that she said it might be possible. The defendant alleged that this should have made it clear to the plaintiff that her position was being changed from full-time to permanent part-time, and constituted reasonable notice. Awarding the plaintiff eight month's notice, that the proposed changes to the job fundamentally altered the employment contract without giving the plaintiff reasonable actual notice.

"The parents of two young boys, nine and 11, require a framework for parenting. Joint custody is not opposed. The father has had primary residence by interim order but that arrangement has been fraught with difficulty for reasons which will be explored. The mother, Sherri, asks that the boys' principal residence be varied and awarded to her. HELD: 1) The best interests test governs the determination on the issue of primary residence. Although the father is 34 years of age and has four older children of other relationships, the Court has found him not entitled to the child tax credit, child support paid by the father of the two children and the Child Tax benefits and employment supplement are the only sources of income for the father. He has abdicated a significant chunk of his caregiving role to his mother and sisters. His unfortunate injuries in the motor vehicle accident did not inspire him to adopt a spirit of compromise. He is currently receiving income replacement benefits from SGI based on 90% of his income. Although he has bounced from home to home, the father has been non-ambulatory and heavily dependent on others. The Court found him to be negligent in many parenting aspects, offsetting by his efforts to communicate with teachers and to have the home environment proposed to be provided for the children. There are red flags.","The parties agree that joint custody is appropriate, but the petitioner mother asked that the principal residence of the two boys be varied and awarded to her. The parties live blocks from each other, but the transition between homes has not gone well. The children have been primarily residing with the father. The father has been in three motor vehicle accidents within three years and is facing criminal charges as a result of the most recent one. The father works long hours as a maintenance man. The mother has four other children from previous relationships. The children of the marriage indicate that they have some problems with one step brother, who lives in their mother's home. The children's academic performance is not strong and the parents have made little effort to assist their children in pursuing an education. One child has been non- compliant with his ADHD medication while in the father's care. While the mother has a more stable residence, both parties have bounced from home to home. The father has tended to abdicate parenting responsibilities to his relatives and has not used the mother as a caregiver of first resort. The mother's relationship with her children has not been fostered in a meaningful way. HELD: While there is no ideal solution, the Court ordered a shared parenting arrangement where the children would spend one week in each home when school started in the fall. The parents were required to participate in mediation sessions which were to be paid for by the father. Joint custody was ordered.

"The respondent applies for an order to discontinue his obligation to pay child support and spousal support and for all support arrears to be expunged. He relies upon s. 17 of the Divorce Act, RSC 1985, and s. 14 of the Federal Child Support Guidelines.HELD: 1) The original order was correct at the time it was made. The matter did not proceed beyond the interim stage. Rather, from April 2005 through to the present the respondent has been content to have the existing order in place and did not seek to challenge it by way of trial proceedings to obtain a final order different from that pronounced by McIntyre J. 2) The respondent is able to establish he has been working full-time employment for the past four years. In those years he earned an average of $55,120 per annum. This actual situation does constitute material change. There is little doubt it will be onerous for him but then he has avoided paying anything for a considerable period of time. In light of his recalcitrant approach to his support obligation, neither the passage of time nor the quantum of the arrearars should deter from the fact he hasn't provided any meaningful financial support to his children and his former spouse for the entire time the order has been in place. 3) The Court must accept the original Order was correct and it was not made in 2005. It must then determine whether the Arrears of support be varied retroactively to impute a different, albeit lower, income that was said to have been earned by the respondent. There has been continual attempt by the Maintenance Enforcement Office (MEO) to enforce the arreears. The reason why income had to be imputed is because the respondent elected not to challenge the imputation of income made 10 years ago. It is not complete answer to the determination of an appropriate historical income for the respondent, who is now earning $88,808.","HELD: The application was dismissed. The court found with respect to the issues that: 1) the respondent elected not to challenge the imputation of income made in 2005. The court assumed that the imputation was correct. The respondent had not shown a material change required to vary the obligation nor had he met the onus to justify the need for a change to the amount of child support payable for the years 2005 to 2012. From January 2016, the respondent was ordered to pay child support for one child based upon his current income ; and 2) the respondent had not provided any meaningful financial support for his children for the entire period despite the fact that enforcement steps had been taken by the Maintenance Enforcement Office. The court determined that the respondent had the ability to pay the arrears and it would not expunge them. The arrears from 2013 to date would be adjusted to accord with the respondent’s current income.",b_2016skqb29.txt,HELD: The application was dismissed.

"Paterson Sons appealed an arbitration award respecting a contract dispute between it and Rail Contractors. The contract provided that either party can refer any dispute respecting their contractual obligations to arbitration. The dispute arose between the parties respecting the performance of the contract and both parties agreed to a resolution by arbitration. They each retained legal counsel, retained an arbitrator, agreed on an arbitrators arbitrator and defined the issues to be resolved. The arbitrator's award was favourable in most respects to the position taken by the respondent. The issue here was not an error of law on the part of the arbitrator but an alleged error in findings of fact made by the arbitrators on the evidence presented respecting the increased costs of winter construction. HELD: The appeal was dismissed and the award was confirmed. 1)The respondent's application for enforcement of the award is granted without costs.  2)The first ground of appeal was denied. The Court had determined from a review of the record that the findings of the arbitrationrator with which the appellant takes issue, do not involve questions of law but rather involve questions regarding fact.

"The mother sought retroactive child and spousal support. She claimed the husband did not pay sufficient support when both she and the children were dependent upon him.

The claim was dismissed; there would be no order. 2)The mother was entitled to make a claim for support whenever she believed the father's contribution to be inadequate, whether or not she perceived herself separated from him. But she did not do so until 1996 and then did not prosecute her claim for another two years, at a time when neither she nor the childrenwere dependent. 3)Reasons for the denial were not given for the dismissal of the claim.

The petitioner alleged they separated in 1990 when the father left the province to seek work elsewhere. He sent no money for two years until 1992 when he sent $3,200 and bought a washer and dryer.

Mistrial in this case would be unfair to the Crown and would not be in society's interests generally because cases should be decided on all relevant and admissible evidence. This new evidence first came to Crown counsel's attention during a lunch break last week, following the hearing of a voir dire and a day and one-half of evidence in the trial proper. Defence counsel was immediately notified and disclosure was provided to defence counsel within 24 hours of the Crown learning of the new evidence. The accused moved for a continuation of the publication ban on the 'newly discovered evidence' mentioned in yesterday's decision and in the decision today. HELD: The accused was found guilty. She was relieved from her previous agreements and undertakings regarding trial process, agreements with respect to the video taped evidence and her right not to call defence evidence and to remain silent. The Court held that it was impossible to cure the prejudice of late disclosure to the accused by an order requiring her to re-elect. There was no breach of her right to make full answer and defence at trial, given that she had negotiated with her counsel prior to the discovery of the evidence, she was not prejudiced in any way, shape or form, by the disclosure of this new evidence, and her decision to not challenge its admissibility was not made lightly.","The accused, who faced three counts of trafficking and possession for the purposes of trafficking, had negotiated agreements with the Crown that preserved her right to re-elect from a trial by judge and jury to a trial by judge alone and provided that she would not contest the admissibility of a video statement she had given to the police and, if a motion to dismiss at the conclusion of the Crown's case was unsuccessful, she would testify in her own defence. Following a voir dire and one-and-a-half days of trial, new evidence (which could be used to impeach the accused's credibility and contradict things she had told the police in the video statement) came to the Crown's attention. The accused argued that the admission of this new evidence would adversely affect her approach to the trial as important tactical decisions had been made on the strength of the Crown's previous disclosure. Mistrial declared; the accused is released from the undertakings and agreements made to date and has the right to re-elect her mode of trial. The late disclosure breached the accused's ability to make full answer and defence owing to the decisions she had already made regarding her defence and trial strategy and prejudiced her in a number of ways, which prejudice could not be cured by an adjournment or other order at this late stage. However, to proceed with the trial without the new evidence would be unfair to the Crown and compromise the court's 'truth seeking' function.",7_2010nssc146.txt,"Following a voir dire and one-and-a-half days of trial, new evidence (which could be used to impeach the accused's credibility and contradict things she had told the police in the video statement) came to the Crown's attention.

"The medical resident pursuing certification as a specialist in orthopaedic surgery appealed both his suspension and probation as a medical resident and to prohibit the Investigation Committee established to look into the matter from taking further action. An appeal committee was struck pursuant to the provisions of the College of Medicine Regulations for Dealing with Unsatisfactory Evaluations and Disciplinary Action Part (RTCA). The appellant's counsel, the union's counsel and counsel for the university, raised the issue of bias on the part of the Committee. The Committee considered the matter and, by letter dated August 21, 2001, advised the appellant the decision should be reversed or altered. The appellant brought the application for an order prohibiting the committee from proceeding further and ordering him reinstated as resident. The chambers judge refused to grant the relief requested, finding the issues to be academic in nature and thus within the exclusive jurisdiction of the University, but did rule the appellant's supervisor should be removed from the committee because of an apprehension of bias. HELD: The appeal was dismissed with costs on double Column V. 1)There was no tenable basis for interfering with the Chambers judge's disposition of the application. The remedies prayed for are discretionary by nature, the writs being writs of grace and the result is not so plainly wrong as to warrant intervention (see Rimmer v. Adshead). 2)Given the long delay, including the delay in seeking recourse attributable to the appellant, the appellant must demonstrate the Chamber judge abused his discretion. No error of principal, nor any misapprehension of or disregard for any material fact has been demonstrated. Nor did the chambers judge fail to act judicially. 3)The application was premature as there were other avenues of appeal open to the applicant.","The appellant was unsuccessful in Queen's Bench in having his suspension and probation as a medical resident rescinded or to prohibit the Investigation Committee, which met on approximately seven occasions and interviewed seven witnesses, from taking further action. The Chambers judge refused to grant relief, finding the issues to be academic in nature and within the exclusive jurisdiction of the University, but ruled his supervisor should be removed from the Committee because of an apprehension of bias. The appellant applied to adduce fresh evidence consisting of a letter from the Investigating Committee describing how it intended to proceed. The appellant argued the matter was disciplinary, not academic, and as it can ultimately result in his dismissal, he is entitled to procedural fairness, including a fair hearing, the right to cross-examination of witnesses, to call his own witnesses, to active legal representation and to full disclosure. He argued all committee members, except the union representative, should be excluded by reason of bias. HELD: The appeal was dismissed with costs on double Column V. 1)The material did not meet the test for the admission of fresh evidence. It simply restated what was at issue and found to have had no effect. 2)There was no tenable basis for interfering. The remedies are discretionary. 3)The Court was not prepared to grant the relief in any event, given the long delay in seeking recourse. The initial concern was bias and jurisdiction. The issue of whether the proceedings were academic or disciplinary was not raised until the application below. 4)The application was premature as there are other avenues of appeal provided in the regulations.

"The plaintiffs sought a declaration that they havecomplied with the requirements of s. 27(2) of the Saskatchewan Farm Security Act and an order requiring the defendant to sell to them the lands which are the subject of their exercise of their right of first refusal under the Act. The defendant resisted the requested relief on the basis the plaintiffs had not validly exercised their right to first refusal. Specifically that they did not meet the requirements set out in the legislation.

The defendant counterclaimed for rent owing by the plaintiffs as overholding tenants. HELD: A declaration issued that the plaintiffs had complied with s27 of the Farm Security Act in exercising their right of first refusal and the defendant was to forthwith transfer the land to the plaintiffs for $629,280 on the usual trust conditions.

A letter of credit binding the financial institution to advance the money in any event would be beyond the means of most farmers who had recently experienced difficult financial circumstances.

"The parties separated in June 1992 and the petitioner voluntarily left the matrimonial home in November 1992. There has been a marriage breakdown and the divorce is granted. The parties have two children, a son born January 1989 and a daughter September 1988. The Matrimonial Property Act, s. 275(2nd Supp) allows for joint custody of the children with access to the matristonial home on alternating weekends. The matrimony home is currently operated by the respondent. The respondent seeks equal parental control and responsibility by an order for joint access under s. 16(4) of the Divorce Act. The children's investment arrangements in Canada Savings Bonds and Mutual Funds exist in the children's names in the approximate amount of $2,000.00 each. The petitioner proposes to be the final decision maker in matters relating to the childrens welfare, growth and development while being prepared to promote maximum contact between the parties to the extent that this is consistent with the best interests of the young children.","This was a petition for divorce with an application for settlement of corollary matters, especially custody and access. The mother was the primary caregiver during the marriage, but the father also made significant contributions. The parties had an interim order for joint custody, which the father sought to continue. The mother sought sole custody with generous access. The evidence was that although both parents were good parents, they had difficulty in resolving problems between them, causing a lack of communication. Allowing the mother's application, that because the day to day decision-making was problematic, it was necessary for one of the parties to be given final say.

"The plaintiff alleged negligence by the two defendants medical doctors and alleged damages arising from the negligence of the doctors. He suffered a puncture/tear wound received while climbing an iron fence. He was impaled on a picket fence for half an hour. Emergency Department staff did not attend to treat the plaintiff as he was hanging upside down on the fence. At the hospital, he was assessed by an emergency room specialist. He claimed to have been impaled for approximately 25 minutes. No mention was made of the puncture wound, the treatment of which was appropriate and within the standard of care expected of an emergency medicine specialist. The plaintiff's disability was mild and he did not appear to be in shock. The medical examiners' notes indicated an extremely low temperature, moderate blood pressure, and a high blood pressure. None of these findings was accepted by the plaintiff's medical experts. In assessing damages, the court found that the defendants and each of them did not fall below the standards of care required of them in their treatment of the plaintiff. Further, the plaintiffs loss is not attributable to any of the acts of the defendants but rather is the direct result of the injury he suffered.","The plaintiff's leg was impaled for 25 minutes on an iron fence which he had attempted to climb for. He was treated at the emergency department of the Victoria General Hospital for an hour. He did not inform the doctors as to the length of time he had been impaled.

The wound quickly worsened, and the plaintiff was forced to undergo surgery and a skin graft to repair his leg. He sued the doctors who initially treated him for negligence.

"The plaintiff engaged the defendant, D&S Homes Ltd., to construct a residence. It is alleged that the defendant failed to perform as agreed and in consequence the plaintiff seeks damages. The defendant resists the claim and by way of a counterclaim seeks judgment for extras requested by the plaintiff. HELD: The claim was dismissed with costs to the plaintiff set at $1,000. The plaintiff is entitled to recover the sum of $4,000 that he paid to the defendant. 1) The Court was satisfied that there was a discussion about round pillars and it was intended that they would be a part of the contract. However, the defendant simply forgot about the discussion and the work was done. 2) The plaintiff was liable to pay for all extras which he requested. He was entitled to rely upon the representations of the defendant as to cost. Only an estimate was provided and some tolerance should be allowed. 3) Costs of Performance were to be preferred as the measure of damages, but reasonableness may require a different approach including diminution of value. The Court found that the plaintiff was not entitled to any of the extras and dismissed the claim against him.","The plaintiff claimed damages for failure to perform as agreed in constructing a residence. Deficiencies included a large crack in a ceiling, a loose overhang, a plugged eaves trough which overflowed and stained the stucco, peeling paint, tiles which fell off, missing soffits, defective weatherstripping, cracks around the skylights and build outs and a defective steam shower. The defendant counterclaimed for extras requested by the plaintiff. HELD: The plaintiff was awarded judgment for $7,654.61. The $4,000.83 withheld by the plaintiff was set off against this claim. 1)It was intended the round pillars would be part of the contract. They were not an extra that the plaintiff should be responsible for. 2)The steam room was an extra ordered by the plaintiff but he was entitled to rely upon the representations of the defendant as to cost. 3)The parties agreed the amount to be charged to the plaintiff was the actual cost to the defendant.

"The appellant appealed his conviction of operating a motor vehicle while impaired contrary to s.255 and 253 of the Criminal Code. The trial judge misdirected herself in finding that there was sufficient evidence beyond a reasonable doubt that the appellant's ability to operate motor vehicle was impaired by alcohol or drugs. The learned trial judge drew an incorrect inference from the facts at trial, in finding the appellant was not in care and control of the vehicle because the appellant rendered it inoperable by removing its keys. The appellant argued that the conviction must be set aside in the absence of evidence proving the coexistence of impairment and care and Control during either time frame No. 2. Direct evidence confirms that the accused's condition did not change for the period that he was in the driver's seat and if impairment is indeed proven, which is the next issue will deal with, then it applies equally to when he was first observed in the vehicle as to later observed in it. HELD: The appeal was dismissed.  1)The trial judge made no palpable or overriding error in her assessment of the evidence, her interpretation of the law, her application of the test in Hodge's Case (1838), 1838 CanLII (FOREP), 168 E.R. 1136. 2)The inference made by the trial judge is one that a properly instructed jury could have arrived at on the facts in the instant case and therefore should not be interfered with. The Court was satisfied that the Crown's findings of fact concerning the essential elements of care, control and impairment by alcohol are supported by the evidence. Direct and unambiguous evidence confirms the appellant had care and care of the subject motor vehicle during time frame 1. In addition, to the Crown relied on the presumption afforded by s.258 of the Code, the rebuttal evidence led by the appellant failed to rebut the same.

"The deceased made a will and codicil in November 1989 and December 11, 1989 respectively. Neither made any provision for the younger child. The executors were directed to hold the farmlands and improvements in trust for him until he attains the age of twenty-one years. The residue was subject to sale in the Executor's absolute discretion with the like discretion to apply the net income and to encroach on capital for the maintenance of the child until he reaches the ripe old age. The father sought an order under the Dependents' Relief Act varying child maintenance from $150 per child to $1,245 per month for the two children. HELD: 1)Nothing within the will, read as a whole, with reference to the ordinary rules of construction,requires the term 'personal effects' to be given anythingother than its ordinary meaning; with the clarification that the Testator did not wish to preserve personal use vehicles. The term is not a physical chattel having some personal connection with the deceased. It is to be determined having regard to the testator's legal and moral obligations to the dependent and others. A more generous award may result. 2)The estate was substantially smaller, the children had a longer period of dependency and there would be a reserves remaining for unknown contingencies and undetermined costs and expenses. These calculations are only crude estimation but have attempted to consider the children's current needs weighed against what the Estate can reasonably bear in all the unknown circumstances, while still giving effect to the testingator's intentions to preserve the farmland in specie for conveyance to the children at twenty years of age.","The petitioner sought an order under the Dependent's Relief Act that the younger child share equally with his brother in the estate of their deceased father. Neither the deceased's Will nor the codicil made in November and December 1989 respectively made provision for the second son born December 1989, subsequent to the separation of the parties. The elder son was the sole beneficiary and the farmlands were to be held in trust for him until he turned twenty-one. The younger son was diabetic and had extraordinary medical expenses. The eldest required braces. The mother's income was $1,089 per month. The deceased had been paying support in the amount of $150 per month per child pursuant to the 1991 divorce order. The mother sought an order under s17(4) of the Divorce Act varying child maintenance from $300 to $1,245 per month for the two children. The Executors did not oppose the application but put in issue the Estate's ability to support that level of maintenance. HELD: The younger child was entitled to share equally with his brother in the estate as a reasonable provision had not been made for his maintenance. Maintenance was varied to $900 per month for the two children.  1)Different considerations arise in the context of a Dependants' Relief Act application taken in conjunction with a variation application. The phrase 'reasonable provision' in s9(1) of the Dependants' Relief Act is to be no longer defined as that which would permit the dependent to maintain the standard of living enjoyed during the lifetime of the testator but is to be determined having regard to the testator's legal and moral obligations to the dependent and others (Ostrander). A more generous award may result. 2)The preservation of an inheritance until the children attain the age of twenty-one is not a predominant factor. The amount of maintenance is not, of necessity, tied to the standard of living experienced when the testator was alive or to the net income the Estate will generate subsequently. The court departed from the Guidelines for the reason the award was made in conjunction with a Dependent's Relief application, the income of the estate was currently unknown, but the court was satisfied that reasonable provision has been made for the children. 3)There was nothing in the Will, read as a whole with reference to the ordinary rules of construction which required the term personal effects to be given anything other than their ordinary meaning; with the clarification that the testator did not wish to preserve personal use vehicles. Thus, personal effects did not include grain, livestock, farm machinery, equipment or other assets related to the operations of the farm.  4)Counsel for both parties were entitled to their costs of the proceedings to be paid on a solicitor-client basis out of the estate.",d_1997canlii11439.txt,"The petitioner sought an order under the Dependent's Relief Act that the younger child share equally with his brother in the estate of their deceased father.

"The Crown appealed the acquittals of the respondents following trial on three charges related to fishing, in contravention of the Saskatchewan Fishery Regulations passed pursuant to the Fisheries Act. Each accused was separately charged with six offences arising out of fishing activities on two lakes in northwestern Saskatchewan on December 1, 1993. The Crown argued that the respondents were in fact commercial fishermen and had admitted in their evidence at trial that they would have sold some of the fish if they had caught any in their nets, that the only aboriginal right the Court should consider was an aboriginal right to fish for food. The respondents were Metis and reside at reasonably isolated Metis community named Turnor Lake. The trial judge found the accused not guilty on counts 1, 2 and 6 of the Constitution Act, 1867 along with the Rupert's Land and North Western Territory Order passed in s. 146 and s.35. The acquittalals based on the constitutional defence which were the subject of this Crownappeal were ordered. The Metis applied for intervener status on the basis of changing the constitutional question to commercial fishing. HELD: The appeal was granted. 1)It was not necessary for the Crown to prove anything with respectto commercial fishing in order to make out all the charges against the accused. 2)The Crown intended not by word or action to make commercial fishing the constitutional issue. Rather the appeal was limited to the argument that such a right was extinguished (appeal ground 4). 3)It is open to the accused to attempt to establish that their clients have an Aboriginal right to fishing for commercial purposes as a potential defence to the charges. 4)The trial judge erred in law by failing to conclude that therequirement to obtain a licence beforeengaging in fishing by means of a net setout in s26(a)of the Saskatchewan Fisheries Regulations does not constitute a prima facie infringement of any existing right to the fish for commercial purpose. 5)The proper characterization of the aboriginal right one of fishing for food, because the offences with which the accused were charged did not relate to commercial activities, but applied whether the fishing was for domestic consumption or forCommercial purposes. 6)The accused were relying on s. 91(24) and 146 of theConstitutional Act. The regulations are justified.","The two accused, both Metis, were separately charged in 1993 with six fishing offences relating to the use of nets. The accused who had ten nets on two lakes at the time of seizure admitted to being commercial fisherman. The Crown had stated to the defence that fishing for commercial purposes would not be an issue. The trial judge dismissed the defence motion for a direction that the Crown comply with his undertaking that the issue was whether the Metis of Northwestern Saskatchewan have an aboriginal right to fish for food. The Provincial Court Judge found both accused not guilty on three of the counts on the basis of standard criminal law defences but would have convicted on the other three charges but for the constitutional defence. The Crown appealed the acquittals based on the constitutional defence. Grounds for appeal included failure to distinguish between an Aboriginal right to fish for food and for commercial purposes; failure to find the accused were engaged in commercial fishing and that neither the accused nor their ancestors possessed an Aboriginal right to fish for commercial purposes; by concluding that scrip issued to Metis pursuant to s6(f) of the Dominion Lands Act and Order-Council did not extinguish any Aboriginal right to fish for food or commercial purposes; the trial judge erred by failing to conclude that the requirement to obtain a licence before fishing with a net was not a prima facie infringement of an existing aboriginal right to fish for food; in acquitting the accused when neither the Aboriginal rights defence nor equality rights defence had any application to the charge. The Saskatchewan Metis Nation and National Council were granted Intervenor status. HELD: 1)The first three grounds were dismissed. The trial judge found that the Crown had not breached an undertaking, nor misrepresented its position with respect to the constitutional issue but implicitly found that the respondents had been prejudiced through the misunderstanding during pre-trial communications between council as to the issues that would be argued during trial. The trial judge was entitled to find as fact that it was not the intention of the parties to confine the issue to commercial fishing. 2)Once it was determined the actual activity was fishing for the purpose of selling the fish, the only rights that could be said to be infringed were either the right to exchange fish for money or goods or the right to fish commercially (Gladstone). The aboriginal right to fish for food was no longer relevant because the evidence did not establish that as the activity they were engaged in. 3)The trial judge's finding that an Aboriginal right to fish existed in Metis persons of northwest Saskatchewan separate and apart from the issue of aboriginal title was one he was entitled to make and should not be disturbed. The case law makes it perfectly clear that aboriginal rights are site specific and the finding of a right in one group in one location does not establish the same right for another group in another location (Van der Peet). 4)There is no basis to distinguish between Indian and Metis people when considering whether a licensing requirement constitutes an infringement of the aboriginal right to fish for food. 5)The departmental policy which placed a higher priority on treaty Indian fishing than domestic licence food fishing for Metis persons constituted an infringement. Once an infringement is found the onus shifts to the Crown to demonstrate that the regulation is justifiable. The infringements could not be justified because they did not relate to any identifiable objective that made them necessary. 6)The trial judge should not have based his decision on the Charter when it was not part of the argument before him without first giving counsel the right to address the argument. 7)Since there is no requirement on a Metis person in the geographical area delineated to have a licence it followed that Regulation 27 requiring a person to legibly mark the licence number of the stakes was also an infringement that could not be justified.",8_1997canlii11328.txt,"The Provincial Court Judge found both accused not guilty on three of the counts on the basis of standard criminal law defences but would have convicted on the other three charges but for the constitutional defence.

"The respondent applied for an interim injunction restraining the respondents from further proceedings in respect of charges prosecuted against him pursuant to the constitution, bylaws and regulations of the Investment Dealers Association of Canada. The application was made pending the outcome of an application for certiorari quashing the decision of the disciplinary panel. The respondent had been found guilty of professional misconduct. The appeal Division found that the applicant would suffer irreparable harm if the injunction were granted as he was unable to work in the investment dealer's capacity. The decision was set aside by the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia and the respondent was ordered to reapply for a hearing on the charges. The applicant applied to have the hearing set aside and the penalties imposed on him for professional misconduct dismissed. Application for interim injunction granted as the matter was premature. The trial judge erred in finding that the American Cyanamid test was not applicable and that the court should not interfere with the proceedings of a quasi-judicial or other tribunal where those proceedings are vexacious.","This was an application for an interim injunction restraining the respondents from further proceedings against the applicant, in particular restraining a sentencing hearing, in respect of charges of professional misconduct.

"The accused was charged with possession of marijuana for the purpose of trafficking, cocaine for the purposes of trafficking and possession of property obtained by crime (s. 5(2) and s. 355(b) of the Criminal Code. The evidence seized by the police was admissible against the accused on the basis that the accused had knapsacks and cash in the vehicle console, which he placed at his feet in the front passenger seat, and a black wallet. HELD: The Crown adduced all of the evidence except for the knapsack which was zipped up and secured by a small lock. The police did not call evidence but argued that this was a circumstantial case in which the Crown had not proven beyond a reasonable doubt that the only reasonable inference to be drawn was that the drugs and money were in the defendant's possession. The accused was found guilty of all three charges before the court. Criminal Code s.4(3) states that anything in possession can be proven by direct evidence or evidence of a person having knowledge of the presence of the item in question, consented to its being there and had some measure of control over it. The possession of cash was proceeds of drug trafficking. The three rolls of cash containing $1000 each were found in the possession of the accused and, because they were in small denominations, found at the same bag as large amounts of cocaine and marijuana, rolled in the manner in which drug dealers commonly hold their cash, and as the accused was a student the previous year and therefore unlikely to have large sums of cash from any other source, the only logical inference was that these rolls were proceeds of cocaine trafficking. Hence find that the defendant had them in his possession knowing they were obtained by the commission in Canada of an offence punishable by indictment.","The defendant was charged with possession of cannabis marijuana and possession of cocaine, both for the purposes of trafficking. When the police approached a group of youth standing around vehicles, through one of the vehicle's open windows they noticed two open bottles of beer. While searching the vehicle for liquor, they moved a knapsack on the floor to check under the seat; the knapsack felt heavy and it felt like there were bottles inside it. The police opened the knapsack and found beer bottles, narcotics and a large amount of cash. In the front pocket of the knapsack, the police found the defendant's wallet with identification and personal papers. They also found packages of cocaine in the console of the vehicle. The defendant, who was not the owner of the vehicle, was not present when the search was conducted. The owner of the vehicle testified that he had picked up the defendant in his vehicle earlier in the day and that the defendant had placed the knapsack in the vehicle. When the police arrived, they both got out of the vehicle and the defendant left. The defence argued that the evidence was all circumstantial. The defendant was found guilty on all charges. The evidence established that the defendant had handed the packages of cocaine found in the console of the vehicle to the vehicle's owner; thus the cocaine was in the defendant's personal possession initially and thereafter in the defendant's and his friend's joint possession. The knapsack was in the personal possession of the defendant when he entered the vehicle and no one else had access to it until the police seized it; the only reasonable inference to be drawn was not only that the knapsack was in the personal possession of the defendant but that since it contained items of such a personal nature and since the cocaine handed to the friend had come from the knapsack and no one else has access to it, the defendant must have had knowledge of all its contents and consented to them being there.

"The appellant appeals his conviction for possession for the purpose of trafficking methamphetamine contrary to s. 5(2) of the Controlled Drugs and Substances Act. His sole ground of appeal hinges on the Court accepting fresh evidence. The central issue at trial was whether the drugs found at the premises being rented by one s. Bodkin belonged to the appellant. The appellant did not follow the procedure outlined by the Supreme Court of Canada in R. v. Lévesque in making this fresh evidence application. HELD: The application to adduce fresh evidence is dismissed.  1) The Court's focus is on credibility. The Crown's case is based, in large measure, on the evidence of the complainant, who was a large drug user at the time of the alleged offence. While clearly not determinative, the avoidance of evidence-splitting with all of its attendant problems results in the same result. 2) The evidence must be credible in the sense that it is reasonably capable of belief and it must be such that if believed it could reasonably, when taken with the other evidence adduced at trial, be expected to have affected the result. 3) There would be a miscarriage of justice if the conviction were affirmed in light of the fresh evidence, the appeal was dismissed.","The appellant appealed his conviction for possession for the purpose of trafficking methamphetamine contrary to s. 5(2) of the Controlled Drugs and Substances Act.

"The Agency applied for permanent care of four children. The first child, S.M., was 5 years old at the time of her birth. The second child, O.D., was approximately 9 months old at that time. The third child (R.M.) was born approximately 15 months later. The Agency had no further information on this child's health other than to say that the child had head lice. S.D.'s schooling was interrupted by a babysitter who allegedly yelled and cursed at her and her parents. The children were out of their mother's care for approximately one-half of her lifetime. An assessment was held in January 2002 and the Agency determined that it was reasonable to enter the finding under 22(2)(b) and that under (3) the finding was made with respect to the respondent, N.D. and on the basis of the risk of the substantial risk to the children caused by the failure of the parent to supervise adequately.

The consistent case law indicates that once an interim custody arrangement has been in place for some time, whether de facto, by court order, or by agreement of the parties, the non-primary care parent should not apply on an interim basis to vary the arrangement (except where risk to the Child exists). In this province, that means obtaining a pre-trial date for pre- trial conference and if the matter is not resolved at that stage, proceed to trial where the Court will determine what is in the best interests of the children. 2)The applicant was granted access every Tuesday and Thursday from 1:00 p.m. until 7:00 am.

"The father applied to vary the corollary relief judgment, which varied the date of his divorce and the amount of support payable. He sought a termination of spousal support or a decrease in support with a fixed date for termination. The wife was now 42 and the father was on a Canada Pension Plan disability payment.

"The plaintiffs apply for certification under The Class Actions Act on behalf of the following classes as set forth in paragraph 5 of the statement of claim: (a) Veterans Resident Class Any Indian person who, as defined under the Indian Act, was not informed of nor was he offered any benefits that he was entitled to by reason of his service either in World War II or in the Korean War as did non-aboriginal veterans. The lengthy delay between the plaintiff's awareness of the symptoms in 1976 and her suit in 1993 could not simply be due to lack of a medical report. The Crown also alleges that the plaintiffs are statute-barred from receiving the Survivors' Pensions that they seek. HELD: The Court held that there were a number of limitations issues, some of which were common and others that would be individual to the class members. 1) The Court found that only if class members succeed in this litigation and reached the bureaucratic stage of applying for an ex gratia payment will the question of individual issues arise. The Court should be reluctant to deny a class member his or her day in court.  2) There are a limited number of resources available to the plaintiffs on a certification application. There is no bar to the bringing of motions even at the pre-certification stage of the proceedings. 3) The plaintiffs have failed to adequately describe an identifiable class; the proposed claims raise common issues which will advance the litigation proposed; to produce workable litigation; to demonstrate there are proposed plaintiffs who would fairly and adequately represent the interests of the class; and to demonstrate they do not have any interest potentially in conflict with other class members such as Indian War Veterans.","Canadian veterans of the Korean War or World War II applied for certification of an action under the Class Actions Act. The plaintiffs claimed they and their dependents were treated differently than non-native war veterans by requiring benefits to be administered by the Department of Indian Affairs or through Indian agents and claimed damages for loss of benefits based on systemic negligence, breach of trust, breach of fiduciary duty and unjust enrichment. They alleged officials and Indian agents were negligent in carrying out their duties to inform the plaintiffs of their right to receive full and complete benefits and in some case agents misappropriated benefits. HELD: The application was dismissed. A class action is not the preferable procedure in the circumstances. The issue of discoverability relating to each plaintiff overwhelms any common issues.

"The respondent had just begun serving the community supervision portion of his custody and supervision order made pursuant to the Youth Criminal Justice Act (YCJA) when he walked away from his designated residence and thereby breached the terms of the order. The provincial director immediately issued a warrant for his apprehension but he was not found by police until almost a month later. His case went to Youth Justice Court for review under s. 103 of the YCJA. The Crown appealed the Youth Court judge's decision and argued that, on a proper reading of the Act, the respondent was deemed not to be serving his sentence during the time between when the warrant was issued and when he was apprehended. HELD: The appeal was allowed. 1) The proper Interpretation of Section 102(1) is that s. 102(2) includes the word 'apprehension' after the reference to s. 107. It is included in s.102(2). As the provincial director reviewed the matter in detail, he concluded that the sentence had continued to run while he was at large and, as a result, had already expired. In consequence, she held that no action was required on the alleged breach of the custody and community supervision order. 2) Section 107(1)(b) does not set out the broad principles of rehabilitation and reintegration. The only thing that can be said for certain is that the conditional supervision of a young person is suspended under the Youth Code. The fact that the youth is not deemed to be continuing to serve the youth sentence as a whole directly undercuts the objectives of the young person who is serving it.","The respondent had just begun serving the community supervision portion of a custody and supervision order made pursuant to the Youth Criminal Justice Act when he walked away from his designated residence and breached the terms of the order. The provincial director immediately issued a warrant for his apprehension but he was not found until almost a month later. His case went to the Youth Court for review under s. 103 of the Act. The Youth Court judge interpreted the Act as meaning the respondent's sentence had continued to run while he was at large and had expired. She held that no action was required on the alleged breach of the custody and supervision order. The Crown appeals the decision. HELD: Appeal allowed. 1) The Youth Court judge erred in her interpretation of the Act. On a proper reading of the Act, the respondent was deemed not to be serving his sentence during the time period between when the warrant was issued and when he was apprehended. 2) A straightforward analysis of the Act serves to answer the question of whether the respondent's sentence continued to run while he was at large. Section 102(1) of the Act sets out the authority of the director, when a young person has breached or is about to breach a condition of his community supervision. The director may, pursuant to s. 102(1)(a), permit the young person to continue to serve his sentence in the community or, pursuant to s. 102(1)(b) of the Act, if the breach is serious and increases the risk to public safety, the director may order the young person to be remanded in custody until a review is conducted. Section 102(2) goes on to make s. 107 and s. 108 applicable to an order for remand and review made pursuant to s. 102(1)(b). Section 107(1) is the provision referred to by s. 102(2) that is of concern. There is an obvious modification of s. 107(1) which 'the circumstances require' when it applies in the context of a breach of the conditions of community supervision. That modification involves the notional deletion of the opening words of the subsection that refers to s. 106 and the substitution in their place of a reference to s. 102. This means two things. First it means that, when the director decides to issue an order under s. 102(1)(b) remanding a young person in custody until a review is conducted, the director has the authority to issue a warrant authorizing the apprehension of the young person. Second it means that if a warrant is issued, the young person's sentence does not run until he or she is apprehended. 3) The court went on to comment further on some of the considerations that seem to have led to the decision in the court below, including the purpose of the Act, the reference to s. 107 that is found in s. 102(2) and the relationship between the concept of the suspension of supervision and the running of the sentence itself.",d_2005skca149.txt,"The Youth Court judge interpreted the Act as meaning the respondent's sentence had continued to run while he was at large and had expired.

The children have been residing with the father since their separation. The mother now sought spousal support pursuant to s. 7(1) of the Matrimonial Property Act.

Both are firmly settled into their local community. HELD: 1) This is a rental property held by a numbered company solely owned by the father. His access to the children every second weekend should include Sunday until 6:00 p.m. It is extraordinary expenses for extracurricular activities and are necessary and reasonable. The parents agree the children will have the opportunity to become involved in many activities in the future. They do not seek periodic support but rather a lump sum payment to cover her tuition at the Atlantic School of Theology. 2) There is no evidence that the parents pose a flight risk. There are several factors that suggest there is a serious economic disadvantage to the wife. The matrimony is palpable. The fact that the children have resided there for the past thirteen years does not change the fact that they love their father and wish to be with him. They have been involved in the family life since the separation and there is no question that they would benefit from his company, Bazoun Enterprises Ltd. However, the evidence of unnecessary repairs is not sufficient to move the children away from the appraisals. Given the standard of living enjoyed by the children, the Court ordered the parents to share these expenses equally.","The parties were married for 13 years and had three children. Both parties appeared to have a standard of living higher than their personal annual income would dictate; the husband by funneling many of his personal expenses through his company and the wife with the financial assistance of her parents.

"The accused applies for relief pursuant to the Charter of Rights on the basis of post-charge delay denying her the right to have her trial in a reasonable time. There was a Charter breach and the appropriate remedy was a stay of proceedings. HELD: The application is granted. 1) There has been a breach of the accused's Charter rights. Fairness to the accused requires that even for offences such as these that trials be held within reasonable period of time so that the accused does not suffer undue prejudice and so that her ability to apply for higher-paying job opportunities and to properly defend against the charges can also be defended. On the other hand, there have been four trial dates set on these charges, resulting in a lengthy delay to a verdict being reached on the charges. 2) There is no evidence that any lack of institutional resources caused any delays. The accused did not contribute to the delay. There were some delays attributable to her in time until she was ready to enter pleas, and later until she could have the matter rescheduled for trial. Otherwise, she appeared on all court dates and was diligent about having the charges set.","The accused applies for relief pursuant to the Charter on the basis of post-charge delay denying her the right to have her trial in a reasonable time.

The Supreme Court proposed as a general guideline a delay of 8 to 10 months in Provincial Court as acceptable. This is consistent with the reality in Buffalo Narrows, where trials are set within 6 months of entering a plea. 2) 12 months of the delay can be attributed to the accused. 6 months was deducted from the delay for inherent time requirements in arranging for the accused's appearance in Court. The remaining delay of 13 months is either attributable to the Crown or caused by factors outside the control of the accused. 3) In this case the accused has suffered actual prejudice in that the delay in bringing this matter to Court from the time of swearing the Information to the date of trial has prejudiced the accused's ability to make full answer and defence and her right to a fair trial.

"The plaintiff's claim against the defendant is for crop damage sustained as a result of the defendant's cattle getting into her canola field in late July, 1999. The plaintiff admits that his cattle were in the plaintiff's canola crop on one occasion but denies liability. The defendant denies any liability under s.27 of the Stray Animals Act and further denies that he was negligent in looking after his cattle. HELD: Judgment was granted in favour of the plaintiff and the defendants together with pre-judgment interest from January 2000 and costs. Under both the present and pre-1977 statutes the cattle owner is strictly liable for damage caused by his straying cattle. The fact remains that the cattle did move onto the field unbeknownst to the defendant, his spouse, his brother or his hired help. The Carrot River did not prove to be an impediment on this occasion. There was no evidence credibly suggesting that water levels would have hindered the cattle on earlier occasions. They did not measure, estimate or make note of the number of bushels or tonnes the cattle had been in. The evidence of wildlife damage was considered independent of the actual damage to the crop. The damages sustained by the plaintiffs were as follows:Total Crop Loss 557 Bushels; Price per bushel; Less 5% Reduction in Yield Calculation; Less 2% reduction in Farm Expenses 152.62Less 5% for Dockage 152.61Net Damages Sustained by the Plaintiffs were $2,533.45.","The plaintiffs claim for crop damage caused by the defendant's cattle entering the plaintiff's canola field.

Civil liability for crop damage caused by cattle flows from the Stray Animals Act. A cattle owner is strictly liable for damages caused by his straying cattle.  This liability may possibly even be absolute and only an act of god may serve as a defence. The issue here is the quantum of the damage. The fact that the defendant was refused access to the plaintiff's property to repair the fence has no bearing on liability in this case. An independent adjuster assessed the damage at 557 bushels.

The claim of Revenue Canada fell into two parts; $166,359.72 representing net goods and services tax assessed for the period January 1, 1991 to July 31, 1992 and $14,223.30 for unpaid personal income tax for the 1991 taxation year. HELD: A conditional order was granted requiring the bankrupt to pay $1,750.00 from any source to the trustee.  1)Rule 319 of the Queen's Bench Rules requires that affidavit evidence must be based upon information and belief as opposed to personal knowledge. 2)The bankrupt was in poor health and had not worked since 1992. He was supported by his common law wife. 3)There was an investigation conducted by the R.C.M.P. as a result of the superintendent's investigation order. The evidence would not support a successful prosecution.  4)Two preliminary objections raised regarding the use of tax information concerning both the bankrupt's common law spouse and Clearsky Enterprises Ltd. The bankrupt submitted that the facts under s.173(1)(a) and s.197 of the Income Tax Act was a final matter and Rule 319 was not satisfied that any of these facts had been proved.

The bankrupt contended that s241 of the Income Tax Act prohibits disclosure of tax information concerning both the bankrupt's common law spouse and the company of which she was sole director and shareholder. The second preliminary issue raised was that portions of an affidavit were based upon information and belief as opposed to personal knowledge as required by Queen's Bench Rule 319 for a final matter.

The relevance of the tardiness in remitting goods and services tax of his common law spouse's company was questionable. The information was confidential and disclosure would be improper for these proceedings.

"Mark Sutherland pleaded guilty to an offence under the Occupational Health and Safety Act for failing to take every precaution that is reasonable in the circumstances to ensure the health and safety of persons at the workplace. The guilty plea relates to the fact that there was a manure pit on the farm that did not have a barrier. HELD: The Court accepted the submission that a $25,000 penalty was a significant penalty for Sutherland. Sutherland's failure was in not securing the manure pit which had its damaged barricade removed while a new one was on order, or not arranging for an alternative to use the pit, alternatives that did exist at the time. The Court did not consider the individual's hardship in imposing a total penalty on a dairy farm.","The defendant farmer pled guilty to failing to take every precaution that was reasonable in the circumstances to ensure the health and safety of persons in the workplace, after a young employee drowned in a manure pit that was not properly secured due to a damaged barricade having been removed while a new one was on order.

This was not in compliance with s. 3(2) of the Act which prescribes that an application may be brought after the expiration of 30 clear days from the date of service on the Provincial Mediation Board.

"The defendant brought a motion pursuant to s. 12 of The Class Actions Act for an order compelling the plaintiff to produce a list of proposed class members who had been provided with a letter and related package by the defendant (relating to a test of their premises for contamination). The plaintiffs sought to have the action proceed as a class action on the basis that the defendants failed to provide basic water services at various Holguin resorts including the 1) Playa Costa Verde Beach, (3) Club Covarrubias, (6) Grand Playa Pesquero, (7) Brisas Guardalavaca and (8) Sol Rio de Luna Mares. HELD: The motion was dismissed.  1) The Court's inherent jurisdiction is to be exercised judicially and only when the relief sought cannot reasonable and realistically be obtained by the applications in some other lawful manner. 2) It is important to remember that we are in the pre-certification stage of this proceeding. This is still an 'action' and not a 'class action' as defined by s. 14 or s. 24 of the Class Action Act. It would appear that the court was concentrating more on common law regarding preliminary conflict objection. 3) The plaintiff was given ample time and opportunity to prepare her affidavit. The examination of the plaintiff could lead to a multitude of issues such as production of documents, undertakings and undertakings. It is not open to the plaintiffs to make use of either section at this time.","Counsel for the plaintiffs brings two notices of motion seeking 1) the opportunity to cross-examine a deponent on her affidavit and 2) an order to compel one of defendants to supply pre-certification notices to all persons who may be eligible to participate in the class action that is contemplated. HELD: The motions are dismissed with no order as to costs.  1) One of defendants contends that 7 people alleged by the plaintiffs to be viable class members have already entered into a full and final settlement with the defendant. This defendant earlier sought to examine these individuals. The Justice of this action at that time did not allow the examination but instead made an order permitting the defendant to file affidavits on the issue. This is the source of the affidavit the plaintiff seeks cross-examination on. The order also allowed the plaintiffs to file reply affidavits, which they chose not to do. There is nothing in the original order that could be interpreted as saying that the plaintiffs could cross-examine on the affidavit. In the view of the Court, having chosen not to file reply affidavits pursuant to the original order, it is not reasonable for plaintiff's counsel to embark on a totally different approach several weeks after the deadline has passed. There is also some concern that the actual purpose of the proposed cross-examination would be more general and broad-ranging than a mere challenge to the defendant's assertion that the individuals at issue have already entered into full and final settlements with the defendant.  2) In its barest sense, plaintiffs' counsel requests that the defendant supply a plaintiff by way of sending pre-certification notices to its clients. The Court is aware of Lewis v. Shell, where an Ontario court ordered notice to potential class members. However, that case is not similar to this case. In the Lewis case, the Court was faced with concern over the defendant contacting individuals who might be potential class members for the purpose of obtaining early settlements. Moreover, the Ontario class actions legislation is less restrictive than Saskatchewan's. The section of the Class Action Act which may permit such an order refer to a 'class action,' not an 'action.'

"This appeal from a spousal support order was allowed orally from the bench for the reasons set out. The appellant was 60 years old and the respondent was 53. Both parties had some health problems. The respondent was diagnosed with breast cancer, had had surgery followed up by radiation, and had shingles and an attack in the nature of stroke in March 2006. The parties had two adult children, born in 1984 and 1989 respectively. After the separation, the respondent had taken a buyout of her pension and job in exchange for $35,000. She testified that she was not capable of working 30 hours a week at minimum wage. She was disabled and did not know when she would be able to work 40 hours per week. The proper income for the appellant was still in the neighbourhood of $30,000 but he still had the same medical issues and the couples' daughter was still living with him and going to university full time. The chambers judge discounted the relevance of the expenses of maintaining the appellant on the basis she was over 18 without determining whether she was still a child of the marriage as a full time student.","The appellant contests an order for $600.00 monthly spousal support given by a Chambers judge on an application to review a previous order which granted the respondent $300.00 monthly spousal support for a period of 1 year. The parties were married for 24 years following a 2-year period of cohabitation. They have 2 adult children, one of which is largely supported by the appellant. Both parties have some health problems. Originally, the appellant was ordered to pay the respondent $300.00 in monthly spousal support for a period of 1 year. Given the appellant's health difficulties and the fact that he was nearing retirement, the trial judge noted that the respondent would do well to become self-sufficient as soon as possible. The Chambers judge who reviewed the original order found that, during the year period the respondent was collecting spousal support, she had not engaged in any gainful employment. She had sold her house and used the proceeds to spend over 4 months living in Hawaii and Jamaica. She obtained probationary employment just after filing a notice of motion but lost the job before the hearing commenced. HELD: The appeal is allowed, the orders of the Chambers judge for spousal support and costs against the appellant are set aside. The Chambers judge imputed an income of $14,289 to the respondent on the basis that she was capable of working 30 hours per week at minimum wage. He did not indicate why he did not find her capable of full time employment. The Chambers judge made an error in calculating the income of the appellant. He also discounted the expenses borne by the appellant in relation the maintenance of their adult child, who was a full-time student.

Included in the fifty-five schools are six school buildings leased by the Cape Breton Board from the Catholic Episcopal Corporation of Antigonish or other entities of the Roman Catholic Church (the ""Church""). It is the responsibility for the leasing of the buildings that is now before the Court. The issue is whether the Minister of Education (the 'Minister') is required to reimburse the board for the costs incurred by the board in leasing these school buildings from the Church. Although the Province is not required to pay the cost of providing school buildings, the Court found that the Board was entitled to use funds that could have been available to meet other educational programs and services in order to pay these leases. The Court ordered the payment of the leasing expenses to the Board.","The applicant sought a declaration that the province was responsible for providing school buildings for delivery of the public school program and that when buildings must be leased, the province bore the associated costs.

"The father applied to reduce the amount of unpaid child support paid for his 2 daughters by one-half. An earlier corollary relief judgment was made in 1989 except that an order suspending enforcement of arrears during periods when the respondent was unemployed was granted. HELD: The application was dismissed. The father was ordered to file a financial statement or cheque stubs evidencing income received from his employment in the past few years and to pay child support of $300 per child during months when his gross monthly earnings are less than $2,200.00 and when the father earns $2200.50 per month or more he shall pay $200 per month on arrear in addition to the on-going child support obligation. 1)Given the significant reduction in income experienced by the respondent since 1994, there has been amaterial change in circumstances.

"The applicant applies for amendment of the judgment insofar as it relates to costs. At the conclusion of trial, counsel requested that costs be reserved on the basis of Column IV, Schedule 1B of the Tariff of Costs. It is now clear that the applicant intended to make a submission for award of solicitor and client costs of approximately $70,000. Evidence was led at trial about insubstantial offers made directly between the parties. The further evidence now shows that substantial offers were made through counsel, although that evidence was not before the Court at trial. The applicant characterizes herself as the successful litigant. HELD: 1)The applicant was awarded fixed costs in the amount of $47,000, together with disbursements.  2)It is incumbent upon the Court not to permit unnecessary litigation to be paid for by the estate. There is a substantial monetary difference between the party and party costs awarded in the judgment and the solicitor & client costs claimed by the applicant; there is a needs-based approach to assess maintenance, as dictated by The Dependants' Relief Act, 1996. The Court is faced with two equally untenable positions in determining the costs. If the costs of the litigation were to be ordered out of the award, the remainder may be insufficient to meet the applicant's anticipated needs. This is not an appropriate case in which to order full solicitor andclient costs. In this situation, however, it is appropriate for the Court to fix the costs to the applicant in lump sum.","The applicant applies for amendment of the judgment dated March 19, 1999 as it relates to costs. At the end of trial, the applicant requested the Court to reserve on the matter of costs. The applicant intended to make a submission for award of solicitor and clients costs. Evidence was led at trial about insubstantial offers made directly between the parties. Further evidence now indicates that substantial offers were made through council although not led at trial. The applicant argues that solicitor and client costs of $70,000 should be awarded because the offer to settle of $250,000 is close to the total judgment award of $230,000 including party and party costs of $20,000. The respondent takes the position that the estate was willing to pay reasonable maintenance costs and the quantum of maintenance could have been summarily determined without the necessity of extensive discoveries and without a lengthy trial. The respondent submits the approach of a needs-based assessment was upheld by the judgment and is always the approach always taken on behalf of the estate. The respondent argues the real question is whether the parties were acting bona fide during their negotiations and the issue should not be determined on the basis of the closeness of the offers. HELD: Solicitor and Client Costs of $70,000 are not appropriate in this case. The applicant's conduct was not entirely pure. The applicant was made aware in a prior judgment that under The Dependants' Relief Act there is nothing to indicate that a person is entitled to part of an estate as a beneficiary but rather that a beneficiary is entitled to maintenance. In spite of this ruling the applicant continued to claim the whole of the estate and to pursue full disclosure of the financial worth of the estate. Solicitor and client costs are within the discretion of the court but such discretion is exercise only in rare and exceptional circumstances. The conduct of the respondent cannot be characterized as reprehensible, scandalous or outrageous.

"This was an appeal from an order that determined, after trial of an issue, that the parties had reached a binding agreement as to the value of the respondent's pension plan during negotiations during a series of pre-trial conferences. HELD: The appeal was allowed from the bench with written reasons to follow. 1)The court reviewed the relevant case law and found that settlement should not be taken as an application to enforce or set aside an agreement compromising an action by summary proceedings. 2)The respondent's correspondence with the appellant constituted an agreement to settle the matrimonial property issue. There was nothing in the evidence that suggested the parties intended that each individual item agreed to during the course of negotiations toward a final agreement would constitute separate, independent, binding and enforceable agreement irrespective of whether agreement was reached on all of the other items outstanding between the parties. Accordingly, there was no contract that the judge could enforce.","After a series of pre-trial conferences, and the exchange of some correspondence between the parties lawyers, the husband took the position that the parties had reached a binding agreement as to the value of his pension. The wife disagreed and a trial of this issue was directed and determined in the husband's favour. The wife appealed. HELD: Appeal allowed.  1)Since the judgment of this Court in Childs v. Childs Estate, [1988] 1 W.W.R. 746, there is no doubt that a judge has the power, under Rule 7 of s. 44 of The Queen's Bench Act, R.S.S. 1978, c. Q-1, to enforce or set aside an agreement compromising an action by summary proceedings. The law as stated in that judgment applies as well to agreements or settlements reached during the course of pre-trial conferences. 2)Parties will not usually intend to settle selected issues on a piecemeal basis, but rather will reach tentative agreements on selected issues conditional on an overall settlement agreement being concluded. Such was the parties' intention in this case, and accordingly, there was no settlement contract for the judge in the court below to enforce.  3)This is not to say that parties cannot reach several separate independent, binding and enforceable agreements as part of an effort to reach an overall settlement of the matters in issue between them, but in order to do so, the intention of the parties to settle on a piecemeal or installment basis must be clear. Nothing in the evidence indicated such an intention in this case. 4)In cases of settlement agreements reached at a pre- trial conference, the application to enforce, or to set aside, should be made under Rule 7 of s. 44 of The Queen's Bench Act as was done in Childs and not under Rule 184A as was the developing practice.",7_1995canlii4030.txt,"After a series of pre-trial conferences, and the exchange of some correspondence between the parties lawyers, the husband took the position that the parties had reached a binding agreement as to the value of his pension.

"The plaintiff sues in Nova Scotia regarding a motor vehicle accident that occurred in a different jurisdiction. The application says that it is for a determination of question of law pursuant to Rule 25.01. Unfortunately, the application does not say whether the plaintiff is barred from suing in the province of Quebec. The only issue that the applicants appear to have tried to resolve is whether the forum chosen is forum non conveniens. The court has nothing before them as to who did what, who agreed to what, and who disagreed with what prior to hearing of the application. In the absence of so many facts about the circumstances surrounding the accident and the witnesses likely to be called on behalf of the defendant, the court find that Nova Scotia is a forum conveniens and that that is the prima facie right to select the forum of his choice.","The plaintiff was injured in a motor vehicle accident in Quebec and commenced an action in Nova Scotia. The applicant applied to determine whether the plaintiff was barred from suing in Nova Scotia concerning the Quebec accident and to dismiss the action on the basis that Nova Scotia was a forum non conveniens.

"Following the conviction of the respondent on a charge of trafficking in morphine contrary to s. 5(1) of the Controlled Drugs and Substances Act, the prosecutor asked the sentencing judge to make a DNA order under s. 487.051(3) under the Criminal Code.

"The accused was observed by police officers driving his all terrain vehicle (ATV) along the community's highway. His driver's license was revoked and he was charged with driving a motor vehicle on the highway while his license was revved. At the time his driver's licence was revoked he was guilty of the offence. The defence argued that the words'motor vehicle' in s. 287(2) do not include an ATV and even if those words did, the accused should be found not guilty because his license revocation is irrelevant since he could never have been licensed to drive an ATIV on the road. The Crown argued that because the accused was driving a vehicle on highway and his 'driver's license' was revoked, he is guilty of driving a prohibited vehicle on a highway under s. 11, but that is not the charge before the court.","The accused was charged with driving a motor vehicle while his licence was revoked when he was found operating an all terrain vehicle (ATV) on a highway. Accused found not guilty; the accused could not have obtained a licence to drive an ATV on the highway because it is a prohibited vehicle.

"The accused was charged with five Criminal Code offences arising from incidents occurring on or about August 22, 2015 in Humboldt, Saskatchewan. The accused was convicted of dangerous driving, dangerous driving and assault. He appealed his conviction on dangerous driving. The trial judge focused on the fact that the accused overtook the complainant, pushed her towards the side of the road and beat her to the side. The complainant was not an overly cooperative witness. She refused to repeat any conversation she had with the accused based on spousal privilege. HELD: The appeal was dismissed. The court found that the trial judge properly instructed herself on the law and that her findings of fact are supported by the evidence. There was nothing in the transcript which suggested that her decision was improperly exercised on either side. On the facts, the appellant's driving behaviour was a marked departure from the conduct expected of a reasonably prudent driver and not a momentary lapse. While some re-examination and re-weighing of the evidence is allowed to determine if it was reasonably capable of supporting a trial judge's conclusion, the court was not entitled to substitute its own opinion for that of that judge.","HELD: The appeal as to the convictions and the sentences imposed was dismissed.

The trial judge was entitled to accept the spouse’s testimony as she was not cross-examined at trial. There was nothing in the transcript that showed the trial judge took a zero tolerance approach.

"The plaintiffs are the five children of the Lawless family who reside near Maryfield, Saskatchewan. They attended a French language school (École de Bellegarde) for the benefit of their children. In February 2013, the school administration informed the family that the children's provisional permission to attend would not be extended for the 2013-2014 school year. The Lawless children filed a complaint with the Saskatchewan Human Rights Commission alleging that the school had discriminated against them because they had a service dog. In August of 2013 the plaintiffs, as represented by the lawyer, applied for an interlocutory injunction that would order the school to grant ongoing permission to the children to attend the school. On September 10, 2013 the defendant applied to strike the plaintiffs' statement of claim. HELD: The Court found that the plaintiffs’ claim was an abuse of process because the plaintiffs never applied for judicial review to set aside the appeal decision rendered by the elected directors of the CÉF and their failure to encourage the children’s learning in French and to encourage their participation in the French immersion program. The court found that s. 23 of the Charter gives it an exclusive and unfettered authority to decide whether it will admit any non-rights holders to attend a fransaskois school in Saskatchewan, and neither this Court nor the SHRC may inquire into its reasons or interfere with its discretion.  1) The Court reviewed the relevant caselaw in s. 25 of The Education Act and found that it would be impossible for the plaintiffs to demonstrate that they had not been discriminated against because of their disability. The Court awarded special damages to the plaintiffs for out-of-pocket expenses incurred in connection with the application to dismiss the claim, the cost of training and re-training the service dog, notwithstanding compensation that might otherwise be available to the plaintiff under the Animal Protection Act; and general damages for out of pocket expenses, travel expenses, expenses, costs of the training and refreshment for the children.","Civil Procedure Injunction HELD: The first portion of the statement of claim is an attempt by the plaintiff to have the Court take jurisdiction over a matter that is already before the Saskatchewan Human Rights Tribunal. While the court has jurisdiction to hear human rights complaints, the jurisdiction only arises after the tribunal process has been exhausted. Since the tribunal procedure has not been completed, the portions of the statement of claim dealing with the human rights complaint are stayed on the basis that the underlying issues may only be heard by the court upon application of the Chief Commissioner of the Saskatchewan Human Rights Code pursuant to s. 29.6 of the Code. With respect to the claim that the defendant breached The Animal Protection Act, the essence of the claim is to seek damages against the plaintiff for the loss of the service dog. That portion of the claim must be struck because the plaintiffs cannot circumvent the provisions of The Animal Protection Act, 1999 nor eliminate the defendant’s right to be charged and tried in Provincial Court through the expediency of claiming a declaration in a civil suit. The third claim is that the defendant was negligent in allowing other children to interact with the service dog will not be struck because, assuming the facts in the pleadings are true, the claim for damages is viable. Likewise, the fourth claim that the defendant intentionally inflicted mental and emotional suffering on the autistic plaintiff will not be struck as is not plain and obvious from the pleadings that the claim cannot succeed. The plaintiffs’ application for an interlocutory injunction was dismissed because the claims that have not been struck are not rationally connected to the injunction, even assuming the remaining claims present a serious issue to be tried they do not justify a finding that the plaintiffs will suffer irreparable harm if the injunction is refused and the balance of convenience weighs in favour of not granting an injunction.",e_2014skqb23.txt,"HELD: The first portion of the statement of claim is an attempt by the plaintiff to have the Court take jurisdiction over a matter that is already before the Saskatchewan Human Rights Tribunal.

"Land developer applied for and failed to receive final subdivision approval. The applicant applied for tentative subdivision approval in 1997 and received the same in 1998. Shortly thereafter, the Municipality passed a new subdivision by-law requiring higher road standards. The development officer declared the application incomplete and declared it to be in fact complete. The municipality appealed the decision of the development officer declaring it incomplete. All aspects of s. 283 have been met and the applicant would have been entitled to final approval. There is no question that this entire case involves the interpretation of piece of legislation, but it is significant that the right of appeal is from a refusal. The fact that the applicant failed to comply with the new road standards and one of the bearings on the plan was missing represented a major obstacle for the applicant. The Municipality relies upon s. 278 of the Municipal Government Act in its submission that the higher road standard is applicable. This decision is set aside. On the same basis, the Applicant is entitled to a declaration that the application is complete, (again subject to non-contentious error in the plan).","The applicant, having received a tentative subdivision approval, applied for final approval. In the meantime, the Municipality's road construction specifications had become more stringent and his proposal did not comply with the new specifications. The development officer found the application to be incomplete and the applicant applied for certiorari and mandamus. Certiorari granted; declaration issued that application for final subdivision approval was complete; order for mandamus granted and the development officer directed to issue final approval (subject only to the applicant correcting the technical error in the plan). The development officer's decision was based on interpretation of relevant legislation and the proper standard of review is correctness. The development officer misinterpreted the legislation. Since the applicant had already received tentative approval under the old regime, it did not have to meet the new higher standards for final approval. There was not another legal remedy open to the applicant equally convenient, beneficial and appropriate. The right of appeal under the legislation existed only from a refusal by a development officer and technically, this was not a refusal as the application was found incomplete.

"The plaintiff corporation was amalgamated with the defendant corporation and held itself out as an energy efficiency consultant.

The plaintiff opposed the agreement and brought a motion to stay the action on the basis of forum non conveniens. In this action, the plaintiff paid the defendant what the plaintiff terms deposit and what the defendant calls service fee of Eight Thousand Dollars ($8,000).

"The issue of divorce, custody and access was disposed of by judgments given during the course of the trial by consent of the parties. HELD: 1) The respondent owned one-quarter of the estate land and it is agreed that his share is matrimonial property. Therefore, the Court declined to order any spousal support. 2) The Court was satisfied on the evidence this debt still exists and that the respondent owes and must pay the sum of $25,812.50 from his interest in the estate. The Court did not find any evidence as to the value of any of the farm equipment but found that it was owned equally by the respondent and the mother. 3) The appraised contributory yard site for the NW 1/4 of 19-20-5-W3 was valued at $96,600. However, the petitioner was awarded judgment against the respondent for the sum less $15,580.00 leaving a balance of $97,575.19 to be paid to the petitioner, less one-half the costs of the appraisals. The judgment shall be a charge on the respondent's personal land. 4) The court found that the average capital cost on land and buildings should not be added back for purposes of determining respondent's income and for the purpose of the Guidelines. The amount of the loan secured by the van now in the possession of the petitioner is $1,000 less than the amount remaining unpaid. 5) The petitioner's income was fixed at $11,376.00 per year. The respondent was responsible for $100 per week of day care and $400 per month of play school. The petitioner earned approximately $200 per month in tips and the respondent was to pay one half of the cost of extra-curricular activities as set forth on Exhibits P-9, P-10 and P-ll. The court was satisfied the respondent had the means to pay Spousal Support.","Issues of divorce, custody and access were disposed of by judgment given during the course of the trial by consent of the parties. Matrimonial property was to be divided, maintenance for the children and spousal support were to be determined. HELD: 1)Access was to be mutually agreed upon with the 18 year old to whom the respondent stood in loco parentis.  2)Expert evidence of tax implications was not called as the respondent failed to give notice as required by the Rules of Court. 3)The mother's annual income for purposes of the Guidelines was fixed at $11,376 not including the $300 child support she received from the natural father of the 18 year old. The respondent's farming income was determined on a 3 year average as it varied from year to year. The facts justified adding back 25% of the capital cost allowance on the machinery over the last 3 years for Guideline purposes. Day care and play school costs of $440 per month were to be divided according to their proportionate share based on the Guidelines. The respondent was to pay one-half of the cost of extra curricular activities and any future activities as agreed upon. The approach used in Cook v. Kilduff was adopted and the amount for the two natural children was deducted from the amount payable for three children. One-half of the difference was added to the Guideline amount of support for the two children. 4)Spousal support was not ordered. The mother was employed and the respondent's income was not likely to increase in the near future.

The Government is entitled to know the case it has to meet. If the defendant knows the statutes and regulations on which he relies, he must provide particulars of same. If he does not, he is not obliged to provide further particulars. 2) The evidence of breach of confidence in the defendant's ability to conduct due diligence on behalf of the plaintiff and for the benefit of the general public is conclusive. 3) The pleadings do not support a claim for damages for breach of a duty or breach of an interest.","The Government seeks an order pursuant to Rule 164(4) of the Queen's Bench Rules requiring the plaintiff to provide better particulars in response to its demand for particulars and pursuant to Rule 173 of the Rules and order striking portions of the pleadings.
