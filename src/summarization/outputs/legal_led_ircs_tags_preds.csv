Warrant issued to search a dwelling house for weapons allegedly used in an attempted armed robbery. The affidavit in support referred to an unknown informant. Judge applied the test that the justice of the peace `must be satisfied on reasonable grounds.' Substantial compliance found and warrant upheld.,"The respondent, a justice of the peace, issued a search warrant to search a dwelling house for weapons allegedly used in an attempted armed robbery. The applicants sought an order quashing the warrant on the grounds that the said search warrant was unlawfully and invalidly issued in excess of the jurisdiction of the respondent. HELD: The application was dismissed. 1)The information sworn in support of the application for the search warrant failed to disclose the existence of reasonable and probable grounds to believe that the items sought to be seized would be found at the location which was to be the subject of the search.  2)The respondent acted within her jurisdiction in issuing the warrant."
"The defendant lawyer was retained for the purpose of obtaining and disbursing mortgage funds. The plaintiffs, creditors of the defendant's client, sued the defendant for negligent misrepresentation, breach of trust and breach of undertaking. The defendant initially received three irrevocable letters of direction for payment of amounts owing on a construction project. When the project got into financial difficulty the defendant advised his client to seek separate counsel to deal with the creditors - suppliers. At a creditors meeting the defendant advised the creditors' counsel of the initial three letters of direction. The project was considered viable by the creditors and continued, with the defendant obtaining postponements of the three letters of direction. Further creditors' meetings were held, a Creditors' Committee struck, and subsequent letters of direction sent to the defendant by the client and certain creditors. The defendant, in acknowledging a subsequent letter of direction, made no mention of the earlier three letters, nor any explanation of 'all of the proceeds'. One member of the Committee was aware of the initial irrevocable letters of direction. On what was to be the final mortgage draw, the defendant requested and was refused a postponement of the initial three letters. With his client's consent, the defendant disbursed the funds, to pay off the initial three creditors, a mechanics' lien referred in one of the subsequent letters of direction, his legal fees and the balance as per a letter of direction received from two of three members of the Creditors' Committee. Dismissing the action, that (1) there was no negligent misrepresentation as the creditors had continued to advance supplies, not on the basis of the defendant's letter of acknowledgement, but because they considered the project viable. Further, certain other plaintiffs were not aware of the letter, and could not have relied on it. Other plaintiffs did not supply after the letter and therefore did not rely on it. The Court noted that on a balance of probabilities, the defendant's disbursement did not cause the demise of the project. At the time of the disbursement the project was still viable and the plaintiffs made their own decision to cease supplying and to lien the project;  (2) there was no breach of trust as the defendant had no fiduciary duty and had at no time acted for the plaintiffs;  and  (3) there was no breach of undertaking as the undertaking must be considered in all the circumstances, including knowledge of the plaintiffs, the other letters and meetings. The Court concluded that the member of the Creditors' Committee who was aware of the initial irrevocable letters had a duty to advise the other members. The documentation was clear that legal fees would be deducted and the Committee was also aware of the direction to pay the mechanics' lien.","The plaintiffs sought to have the defendant's solicitor disburse funds from mortgage draws and insurance claims made against them by the defendant. The defendant was retained to act as general counsel to and to the project. The project was financially tight from the very beginning and cash flow was continuously problem. In early 1987, the defendant received a number of irrevocable letters of direction, which he acknowledged, requiring him to pay the mortgage draws in a particular manner. During this time, the first two mortgagee made an overrun and the project at this time had a cash flow problem.. The defendant recommended that retain separate legal counsel to deal with the second mortgagee problem and the subsequent mortgage advances, but there was no evidence that the defendant was ever in a fiduciary relationship with the plaintiffs or purposed in any way to act for them or on their behalf. The plaintiffs had not established the basis for a claim under breach of trust and could not succeed on this ground."
"The applicant sought an order for certiorari quashing a decision of the trial judge granting an adjournment and a prohibition from hearing the trial. In earlier hearings, the Crown and applicant had each sought new trial dates to ensure procurement of witnesses for trial. The Crown sought to subpoena the victim to testify. Due to the delay in obtaining authority to serve an out of town subpoena in New Brunswick, the Crown was unable to serve the victim until three days before trial. The victim did not learn of the trial date until the day before and was unable to attend. An adjournment was granted. The applicant contended the trial judge had exceeded his jurisdiction. Dismissing the application. It is within the jurisdiction of the trial judge to deal with the issue of adjournments in accordance with the provisions of the Criminal Code. Jurisdictional error is not to be equated with error of law. Any decision to grant an adjournment is therefore within the court's proper discretion. If a remedy exists, it is by way of an appeal and not a prerogative writ. In any event, the sequence of events was sufficient to justify the granting of an adjournment. There was neither neglect nor laches on the part of the Crown.","The applicant sought an order of prohibition and certiorari directing that the judge and provincial court judge cannot hear the trial of the Queen v. Joseph Glenn Jessome. Dismissing the application, that the decision as to whether or not to grant an adjournment was within the jurisdiction of the Judge and that any decision in that regard was an exercise of his discretion within that authority. There was no controversy as to the events leading up to the witness not being available at the date of the trial."
"The accused, a young offender, pleaded guilty to 16 counts of auto theft. He was sentenced to 6 months open custody and 2 years probation. Prior to being sentenced, he spent 13 days on remand and 2 months under house arrest under s.7.1 of the Young Offenders Act. The Crown appealed the sentence. HELD: Appeal allowed. 1)The accused was 15 years of age and had no record. He assisted the police once apprehended. 2)Although another young offender involved in these offences had received a sentence of 9 months open custody, uniformity of sentence was not a factor to be given great weight in comparing dispositions of young offenders. 3)The sentence was increased to 10 months open custody.","The accused pled guilty to 16 counts of auto theft, one count of possession of stolen auto and one count dangerous driving. He spent 13 days on remand and approximately 2 months under strict parental control on house arrest prior to receiving a disposition of six months open custody and two years probation. The Crown appeals the disposition arguing it is not fit having regard for the number of offences and the need to maintain the public's confidence in the administration of justice. HELD: The appeal was allowed and the appeal allowed. 1)The Youth Court judge considered the accused's age, that he had no criminal record and co-operated extensively with the police. He counted the time J.M. spent under house arrest as secure custody. He also took into account the very responsible approach that his father had taken throughout this whole process. 2)The youth's age was not a factor to be given great weight in comparing dispositions of young offenders."
"The respondent owned a warehouse and leased it to the appellant's employer. During the course of her employment, a ceiling tile fell and struck the appellant. Both the respondent and the appellant's employer were employers under the Workers' Compensation Act. The appellant received benefits under the act. She commenced the action against the respondent with the consent of the Workers' Compensation Board. The trial judge held the action barred pursuant to the act. Dismissing the appeal, that s. 18 of the Act bars actions against any employer to which Part I of the Act applies. It is not necessary that the employer be the appellant's employer.",The appellant commenced an action against the respondent for damages with the consent of the Workers' Compensation Board. The chambers application was made before the chambers judge to determine whether the action was barred by s. 18 of the Act. There was an agreed statement of facts and the ban was against actions of 'an employer' not 'his employer' and would appear to extend the ban to all employers.
"The plaintiffs statement of claim was served on the defendant in Ontario two days after it was issued. Two weeks later the prothonotary issued default judgment for $8,000, plus $2,880 in interest and $404.42 in costs. The defendant applied, pursuant to Civil Procedure Rule 12.06, to set aside the default judgment, on the ground that the plaintiff did not meet the requirements for obtaining a default judgment from the prothonotary or, in the alternative, on the merits that it had, by affidavit evidence, raised triable issues and provided a reasonable excuse for its failure to file a defence. Dismissing the application with costs of $1,000 to the plaintiff, that although the plaintiff ought to have sought the court's leave to take default judgment such a procedural ommission did not, in the circumstances, prejudice the defendant. Further, while there were triable issues between the parties, the defendant's failure to file a defence was neither a mistake nor an oversight, but rather a deliberate decision so as not to attorn to Nova Scotia jurisdiction, and therefore was not a reasonable excuse.","The plaintiff corporation applied to set aside its default judgment on the basis of forum non conveniens. The defendant argued that the plaintiff had failed to establish any reasonable excuse for its failure to file a defence. The plaintiff had engaged Ontario counsel to represent its share of the plaintiff's energy savings, the plaintiff taking the position that such savings were entirely unrelated to any advice from the defendant and were, instead, the result of price reductions offered by its own suppliers of fuel. The prothonotary issued a default judgment in Nova Scotia, while simultaneously drawing the plaintiff into litigation in Ontario where it has no presence, which is in the essence of the defendant's strategy. The default judgment was entered in British Columbia but the action in Ontario was commenced in Ontario. In Nova Scotia the plaintiff paid the defendant what the plaintiff terms deposit and what the defendant calls service fee and agreed to pay Fifty Percent of every energy savings enjoyed for a period of sixty months, provided that any of the recommendations were approved by and implemented by the plaintiff.. The plaintiff sought directions pursuant to the Civil Procedure Rule 12.03 (1) to apply for judgment in that province based on the default judgment and for an order dismissing the Ontario action on the grounds of res judicata or abuse of process or, in the alternative, for an Order staying the Ontario proceedings on the same grounds. HELD: The application was dismissed with costs to the plaintiff in the amount of One Thousand Dollars ($1,000.00). 1)Although technically the plaintiff ought to have sought the court's leave to take default under Civil Procedure rule 12.02 (1), because the statement of claim had combined a request for declaratory relief with a claim for what I consider to be liquidated damages, such a procedural omission did not in the circumstances of this case materially affect the defendant. It is difficult to see how the defendant was possibly prejudiced. 2)The defendant's apparent intention to avoid the jurisdiction of the Nova Scotia Supreme Court and draw the plaintiff out of litigation in an Ontario place is, in my view, incapable of constituting a reasonable excuse, as contemplated by the Court's interpretation of Civil Procedure Rules 12.06 in previous cases. It was not a mistake or an oversight."
"The appellant employer and the respondent union are parties to a collective agreement with effect from January 1, 1994 to December 31, 1996. The collective agreement established employee salaries for that period, with annual adjustments on January 1st of each year. Shortly before the agreement was signed, the Public Sector Compensation Act was passed, which rolled back and froze public sector salaries. In a letter to the union, the employer confirmed the wage increases provided for in the agreement would be paid to the employees as a lump sum following the expiration of the legislated wage freeze. After the expiration of the wage freeze, however, the employer refused to pay the lump sum on the grounds that it would contravene the Act. The union sued the employer in the Supreme Court, claiming the lump sum or, in the alternative, damages for negligent misrepresentation. The employer applied to strike the Statement of Claim on the grounds that the union's claims were within the exclusive jurisdiction of an arbitrator. The Chambers judge dismissed the application. The employer appealed. Allowing the appeal and staying the action pending submission to arbitration as provided for in the collective agreement, that the Chambers judge erred in allowing the action to continue. Where there is a doubt about the arbitrability of a dispute, that issue should generally be determined at arbitration. This reflects the central role of arbitration in collective bargaining labour relations, recognizes that arbitration is the forum best suited to conducting the necessary inquiry, and helps ensure that no one, absent sound reasons, will be left with rights but no effective remedy.","This was an appeal from a decision which overturned the respondent's application to strike out the employer's statement of claim on the grounds that the union's claims were within the exclusive jurisdiction of an arbitrator. Allowing the appeal, setting aside the Chambers judge's order and directing the action be stayed pending submission to arbitration as provided for the in the collective agreement, that there was no jurisdiction regardless of the conclusion of the arbitrator on the question of arbitrability, and that there were several factual questions relevant to that issue which could not be explored on an application under Rule 14.25."
"The plaintiff alleged he was sexually assaulted and that Attorney General of Canada as employer of the administrator of the residential school was also responsible. The defendant alleged the First Nation was responsible for the administrator's conduct and applied to join the First Nation as a third party so that contribution or indemnity could be claimed. The applicant required leave under s.7 of the Contributory Negligence Act and Rule 107A(c) of the Rules of Court. HELD: Leave was granted to file a third party notice. 1)The low threshold for the establishment of a prima facie claim was met. 2)The delay would not be inordinate. The plaintiff's claim dated back to 1984. The parties were not ready for trial. No prejudice was established.  3)The third party's liability, if any, will have to be determined on a case by case basis. Each individual action brought by a former student at the residential school is different in nature. 4)The applicant was granted costs of the application against the plaintiff and the First Nation.","The plaintiff alleges that the applicant, the Attorney General of Canada, as the employer of Starr, was responsible for his conduct while he was a student at a residential school. The applicant applies to join the G[…] First Nation as a third party to the action brought by the plaintiff against it and Starr; so that it can claim contribution or indemnity from it if the applicant is found liable to the plaintiff. HELD: The application for leave under s.7 of the Contributory Negligence Act and Rule 107A(c) of the Rules of Court is granted. The court shall have its costs of the application to be taxed against the plaintiff and the proposed third party."
"FIAT: The parties have three children, Jill born December 1981, Luke born May 1986 and Keegan born November 1989. The respondent states that he has paid child support pursuant to the court order of February 2000 but, when the children reached the age of majority, he reduced the amount of child support payable as the children became independent and moved out on their own. The petitioner takes issue with the respondent's unilateral reduction in child support and submits the children remained children within the meaning of the Divorce Act so long as they were attending university. The parties agree that given the age of the children there has been a change in circumstance sufficient to allow a review of the existing child support order. HELD: 1) The parties agree that Jill, age 26 is no longer a child of the marriage and that Luke, age 21 is not presently a child of the marriage but could once again become a child of the marriage if he attends university in the fall of 2008. The parties also agree Keegan is 18 and remains a child of the marriage by virtue of the fact that he is taking classes at the university. 2) While the respondent asks that he be allowed to pay child support directly to the children, there is nothing in the material filed which would indicate that the petitioner is not providing support to the child in an appropriate fashion. Further, the difficulties that would arise in respect to enforcement of the order if the child support payments were not made directly to the petitioner would mitigate against such a variation.","FIAT: The parties filed an application for an order varying child support granted by Justice Dielschneider in 1999. The parties agreed that given the age of the children, and the change in the amount of the respondent's income, that there has been a change in circumstances sufficient to allow a review of the existing child support order. The child, born November 13, 1989, is no longer a child of the marriage within the meaning of the Divorce Act. HELD: 1) Although initially the parties were at odds concerning all three children, by the time of their latest submissions, some consensus had been reached regarding two of them. 2) The parties were in agreement that Jill, now 26 years of age and on her own, was no longer an adult child within the Meaning of the Act. The court ordered that the child support payments would continue on the first day of each and every month until such time as the child, Keegan, is now a child. The difficulties that could arise in enforcement of the order if the child payments were not made directly to Ms. Strueby would mitigate against such a variation."
"The parties were in a relationship for over 5 years though they never married. The petitioner now seeks access to the respondent's daughter from an earlier relationship. The parties' relationship was tumultuous and included some incidents of domestic violence, which the child may have been exposed to. There are concerns regarding the interactions between the respondent's daughter and the petitioner's own children. The petitioner must establish, firstly, that he has 'sufficient interest' to bring this application, per s. 6(1) of The Children's Law Act, 1997. HELD: The application for access is dismissed. In determining whether a non-family applicant is a person with a sufficient interest, the Court must consider a variety of factors including: the extent or degree of the applicant's involvement in the child's life, the duration of that involvement, the level of intimacy and the quality of the relationship between the applicant and the child, how the relationship between the applicant and the child was represented to the world, and whether the applicant provided financially for the child. The petitioner has demonstrated that he is a person of sufficient interest; the relationship between the parties was not short and, during its lifespan, the petitioner formed a close bond with the child and was involved with her life. The community viewed them generally as father and daughter. However, the Court cannot conclude that requiring the child to visit the petitioner would be of any benefit to her. This child has already had to contend with multiple 'fathers' and multiple 'siblings', many of whom have been only temporary or fleeting personalities in her life. The confusion that this has no doubt caused her should not be further compounded by requiring her to make even more adjustments in her understanding of what 'family' means. Access to the petitioner is not in the best interests of this child.","HELD: The Court found that the respondent was a person of sufficient interest to bring this application. The Court held that because the respondent is a'step-parent' to the child, he does not need to establish that he falls within the category of persons having a'sufficient interest' to bring the application.  1) The Court reviewed the circumstances of the parties' relationship and concluded that the relationship spanned years 2000 to 2007, commencing when the child was barely a toddler. The relationship, in one form or another, spanned five years. Over those years, the child lived with her mother and her two older daughters, who were all of the same age as the respondent. 2) The respondent was found to be a person with sufficient interest because he had a close relationship with the child and was in the place of parent to her. 3) The court considered a variety of factors including the extent or degree of the applicant's involvement in the child's life, the duration of that involvement, the level of intimacy and quality of the relationship, how the relationship was represented to the world and whether the applicant provided financially."
"The respondent seeks an order for interim spousal support. The parties were married in January 1991 with three children and ceased to cohabit in December of 1996. The respondent is 52 years old and unemployed. In the past, he has been diagnosed as paranoid schizophrenic and suffering from a personality disorder but is currently, according to his physician, of sound mind. He qualifies since 1987 for a disability pension under CPP by reason of his mental disability which provides for a basic income of $580 plus GTS rebate for a total of $630 per month. The petitioner lives on a section of farm land which was brought into the marriage by the respondent, of which one quarter contains the matrimonial home. The petitioner and children live in that home. The petitioner is 39 years old and is also unemployed because she is an incomplete quadriplegic. The farm land is rented out from which the petitioner receives rental income. The petitioner enjoys an income of $3,400 per month while the respondent receives $630 per month. HELD: The petitioner is ordered to pay the respondent the annual sum of $6,000 paid in monthly installments of $500. There is no juridical reason why the petitioner should obtain the total revenue owned by the respondent particularly when he brought the land into the marriage. In fact, fairness and equity would suggest just the opposite, at least in respect to one half of the revenue. Accordingly, the Court makes an order on the basis of the respondent's ownership of the land rather than order payment of spousal support.","FIAT: The respondent sought an order for interim spousal support. HELD: The court found that relief should be granted but in the circumstances it should not take the form of child support. The respondent had been diagnosed as paranoid schizophrenic and suffering from personality disorder. The petitioner had de facto possession of the matrimonial property, but valued it at $488,040. The difference in value relates to certain farmland which the respondent brought into the marriage.. The petitioner and children resided in that home.. The respondent was 52 years of age and unemployed. He lives with a friend and pays no rent but buys the food for both of them.. The monthly expenses of the children come to $4,086. This includes mortgage and land tax payments. The court ordered the respondent to pay $500 per month."
"The accused, charged with fraud, brought a motion to stay the proceedings on the basis that his Charter rights had been violated by the RCMP and the Office of the Superintendent of Bankruptcy. The accused asked the court to reconsider its decision to quash a subpoena issued to the former Superintendent of Bankruptcy on the basis of testimony presented from other witnesses after the subpoena was quashed. Application dismissed; the accused had not met the onus on the balance of probabilities of establishing that the former Superintendent had relevant or material evidence to offer concerning the issues raised by the Charter motions. The subsequent testimony and documentation did not support the accused's allegations concerning the former Superintendent's motives or conduct.",The defendant was charged with three counts of fraud contrary to s. 380(1)(a) of the Criminal Code relating to his activities as president and principal shareholder of a bankrupt corporation. The defendant brought motions (the 'Charter Motions') seeking a stay of those charges on the basis that his rights under the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms were violated by the Office of the Superintendent of Bankruptcy and by the R.C.M.P. during investigations of his activities and of the administration of the bankrupt corporation and during his time as Superintendent of the OSB during the defendant's tenure. HELD: The application was dismissed. There was no evidence that the defendant would provide any additional information concerning the issues raised by the Charter Motions or that the evidence which those witnesses gave and the documents referred to raise any issues that warrant compelling the defendant to appear at the hearing of the charter Motions.
"The accused is charged with driving without due care and attention contrary to s. 44(1) of the Highway Traffic Act. A pedestrian was crossing a road adjacent to a parking lot and, while walking directly in front of a stopped vehicle, was struck by the vehicle when it rolled forward. HELD: The accused is not guilty. The court accepted the accused's evidence that his vehicle rolled forward only a short distance of not more than one foot and not at a fast or accelerated speed and that the pedestrian was crossing outside of the cross walk and that the accused applied his brakes as soon as he saw the pedestrian. The accused did exercise due diligence.","The accused was charged with driving without due care and attention contrary to s. 44(1) of the Highway Traffic Act. HELD: The accused was found not guilty of the charge. 1)The accused's vehicle rolled forward only a short distance of not more than one foot, and not at a fast or accelerating speed. The officer immediately applied his brake when he saw the accused, and immediately took steps both to assist the accused and to have other officers attend at the scene. The accused's actions in operating his vehicle on the road beside a cross-walk constituted careless driving, as distinguished from dangerous driving under the Criminal Code.  2)The officer who was on duty at the time of the incident did not raise an issue of state of mind. Rather, the officer's evidence was that he did not touch the accelerator, and briefly took his foot off the brake, and then immediately reapplied the brake after seeing the accused. 3)The Court of Queen's Bench test was whether the accused exercised due diligence, or took reasonable care, on this date. Based on the Crown's evidence, and the findings of fact, the accused was convicted of this charge. The first part of the Sault Ste. Marie test is whether the Crown has shown on balance of probabilities that the accused has shown carelessness applying an objective test in assessing carelessness. In this case, the Court accepted the accused's evidence that the most direct route to the area he was called to was proceeding straight south along this road, passing directly to the east of Super Store, and connecting to Highway and subsequently to the bypass leading to the south-west area. The Court also accepted that the officer, who is on duty in a marked police car, was aware that the vehicle was approaching from the left, and that the conversation then became heated between the two, and ended when the accused said he had to leave on his call.. The Court reviewed four areas where inconsistency and conflict in the evidence given by Crown and defence witnesses."
"The appellant appeals his conviction of dangerous driving. The police did not see the appellant driving; they came across his minivan immersed in a slough in excess of 35 feet off the highway. Based on the tire tracks, the appellant was charged with dangerous driving. The trial judge concluded that the circumstantial evidence presented by the Crown was consistent with the appellant's guilt and the circumstantial evidence was inconsistent with any other rational conclusion. The appellant argues that without expert evidence called by the Crown to prove it was not possible for the appellant to have swerved in the manner he testified to create the same physical evidence shown in the photographs, the Crown has failed to prove that the appellant drove through the stop sign. In other words, the trial judge could not simply rely on his own experience to find that the appellant could not have been able to manoeuvre the minivan in the way he described. HELD: Because the Crown's evidence was not the only rational conclusion to be drawn by the trier of fact, the Crown has failed to prove the case beyond a reasonable doubt. While no accident reconstructionist was available to check the accident scene after the incident, the Crown could have called an expert to testify whether the defence's theory could hypothetically be rational. However, no expert was called. The appeal is allowed and the conviction set aside.","The appellant appeals his conviction of dangerous driving. The learned trial judge concluded that the circumstantial evidence presented by the Crown was consistent with the appellant's guilt and the evidence was inconsistent with any other rational conclusion. He also set aside the conviction on appeal. The appellant's counsel argued that, without expert evidence called by the police to prove that it was not possible for Fleury to have swerved in such a manner to create the same physical evidence shown in the photographs, the Crown has failed to prove the case beyond a reasonable doubt. HELD: The appeal was allowed and the conviction was set aside. The appeal is allowed, the conviction is set aside, and the appeal is dismissed. 1) Without expert evidence, the trial judge could not simply rely on his own experience to find that Fleury could not manoeuvre the minivan in the way he told Cst. Poiré.. It seems unlikely that minivan could make 90° left turn at the stop sign without the expert's testimony. 2) The circumstantials evidence presented at trial, and Fleury's unwavering statement that he was travelling south on Highway #2 at the point of the 'T' intersection and swerved to miss a deer that had come onto the highway. The Crown's theory at trial was that the appellant had approached the intersection from the west, and had not stopped. However, from the trajectory of the tire tracks, the fact that the tire track became airborne on impact with the hill and flew into the slough, the accused argued that the Crown had not proven the case. 3) The evidence from the accident and the testimony given by the accused's lawyer to the medical examiner later the afternoon of the accident, that the accused had swerved at considerable speed across the four lanes of traffic, the judge properly concluded this to be dangerous driving.. 4) There is no rational conclusion from which the Crown could draw from the reconstruction of the scene without any expert's knowledge or assistance from the Crown, and therefore, without an expert's opinion to prove it was impossible for the accused to have driven through a stop sign on a divided four-lane highway without stopping at the STOP sign, it was reasonable for the judge to infer that traffic was likely to be heavy at the “T” intersection.. By driving at such high speed across four lanes, the court properly concluded the dangerous driving offence."
"The defendant farmer pled guilty to failing to take every precaution that was reasonable in the circumstances to ensure the health and safety of persons in the workplace, after a young employee drowned in a manure pit that was not properly secured due to a damaged barricade having been removed while a new one was on order. Defendant sentenced to fine of $25,000, from which the sum of $15,000 shall be paid to the Canadian Farmers' Disability Registry; defendant ordered to perform 160 hours of community service with respect to farm safety. The defendant was an individual and not a huge corporation, had been conscientious about safety issues prior to this incident and had endeavored to improve safety at his farm after the incident; the deceased had also failed in his responsibilities under the Act and was working with a significant blood alcohol content.","The defendant, who owned and operated a family dairy farm, pleaded guilty to an offence under the Occupational Health and Safety Act that he failed to take every precaution that is reasonable in the circumstances to ensure the health and safety of persons at the workplace. The defendant's guilty plea relates to the fact that on August 13, 2006, there was a manure pit on the farm that did not have a barrier. The farmer's responsibility to safeguard employees from risks associated with that manure pit arises under s13(1) of the Act. A $25,000 penalty is a significant penalty for the defendant."
"Rule 77.01 – Scope of Rule 77 This is a costs decision following litigation between the mother and father regarding apportionment of custody and access rights, quantification of child support and special expenses for the parties' children. The mother was the successful party and income was imputed by the court to the respondent.  Held, costs in the amount of $3,000 are awarded against the father. The father's position caused unnecessary time, effort and delay. The court referenced L. (N.D.) v. L. (M.S.) (2010) to summarize the principles and case law relevant to determining a cost award under Rule 77. Determining costs in a matrimonial manner is more complex given mixed outcomes and the burden of costs placed on families and children such that the court may need to exercise discretion and move away from a strict application on tariffs.","This was a costs decision. The parties litigated the apportionment of custody and access rights and the quantification of child support and special expenses for their two children. The respondent sought an award of costs valued at $3,000 based on an application of Scale of Tariff 'A' of the Costs and Fees Act, supra. The tariff is reproduced following Rule 77. The court imputed an income level to the respondent that she was prepared to accept prior to the commencement of the hearing ($25,000) and assigned an additional half day of Court time to this aspect of the case. HELD: The costs award was to be for a very good reason and be based on principle. 1) The new rule on costs contains the tariffs when applying an amount involved assessment to determine costs payable by party. The tariffs are reproduced following rule 77. 2) The court reviewed the changes from the 1972 Rules to the new rules and found that failure to timely disclose on the part of the petitioner did not constitute a substantial contribution towards the parties' reasonable expenses. It is preferable not to increase artificially the 'amount involved' but rather, to award lump sum. 3) Costs are in the discretion of the Court. Costs awarded in matrimonial matters is difficult given the often mixed outcome and the need to consider the impact of an onerous costs award on families and children in particular. If the award determined by the tariff does not represent substantial contribution to the parties reasonable expenses, the resulting reduction in total income serves to diminish the litigant's tax bill."
"FIAT. SaskPower sought an order pursuant to Queen's Bench Rule 547 to require the plaintiffs to post security for costs on the ground Wind Power was a non-resident plaintiff with little or no assets in the province of Saskatchewan. HELD: The motion was dismissed.  1)Rule 547 is limited to cases where the plaintiff is a non-resident or where the defendant is given a statutory right to apply. Wind Power is an Alberta company extra-provincially registered in Saskatchewan. Dove Industries, a Saskatchewan company incorporated specifically to develop a pilot project in Saskatchewan which did not proceed, had shareholders in the province. 2)Given the amount of the claim against SaskPower in the amount of $6,400,000 and the significant claim for costs in excess of $50,000 the Court would have granted the security for costs but for the delay by SaskPower in bringing its application. The action was commenced in April 1996. Unexplained delay by a defendant in seeking security for costs will prevent the grant of an order. To make an award for security for costs at this stage would place a burden on the plaintiffs and possibly prevent the action from taking place at the scheduled time.  3)The plaintiff was awarded one set of costs in any event of the cause.","FIAT. The defendant sought an order pursuant to Queen's Bench Rule 547 requiring the plaintiffs to post security for costs in this action on the ground that Wind Power Inc. is a non-resident plaintiff with little or no assets in the province of Saskatchewan and Dove Industries, Inc., while a corporation incorporated in Saskatchewan, was a corporation specifically for a wind power demonstration project which did not proceed (and which is related to the subject matter of this action) and accordingly had little or none assets in Saskatchewan. HELD: The defendant's motion was dismissed. 1)The court has no jurisdiction to order security except in the instances where it has jurisdiction. 2)There are appropriate circumstances to deny the defendant an order that the plaintiffs post security. for costs at this stage of the action. 3)The Court is permitted to invoke its inherent. jurisdiction to regulate its own procedure. by ordering security in all cases where it is thought. just to do so. 4)Rule 547 is not a code which confines the court's jurisdiction to those areas. The Court would be more inclined to enter into meaningful settlement discussions if it was determined the plaintiffs' claims were joint. 5)To make an award for security in this stage would place a burden on the plaintiffs and possibly prevent the action from taking place at the scheduled time.  5)In this case, there are 'appropriate. circumstances' per Grotsky J. in Thole v. McKenna (1988), which denied the defendant's application for costs. In the exercise of his discretionary Discretion, the Court would dismiss SaskPower's motion."
"The Workers' Compensation Board applied, by way of stated case, to have the Court answer questions with respect to the interpretation of certain provisions of the Workers' Compensation Act. There were 40 questions in total. The Court was asked to relate the questions to 19 factual summaries presented by the Board concerning cases before it. The Court was required to decide whether the questions were the proper subject matter of a stated case. Dismissing the stated case application, that the questions submitted are hypothetical and speculative. They are therefore inappropriate questions for a stated case, which requires that questions must be responsive to the facts and must not be speculative.","The Court dismissed the application for the stated case. Application dismissed orally. The Court was substantially in agreement with the submissions of counsel for the respondent that this Court should decline to answer the questions submitted to it by the applicant. These questions were eight in number but when broken down into their parts, result in some forty questions. The questions were predicated on a determination as yet unmade. They were not responsive to the evidence or to any determination made to date in the case and, indeed, by their very wording were speculative and hypothetical."
"The plaintiffs claim for crop damage caused by the defendant's cattle entering the plaintiff's canola field. The defendant denies he is responsible or negligent, but admits his cattle were in the field.HELD: Damages were awarded in the amount of $2,533.45. The court valued the loss at $3,052.36. It then deducted 2% attributed to wild animal damage, 5% for the plaintiffs failure to calculate actual yield from the rest of the crop, 5% that the plaintiffs would have paid in dockage and 5% for the cost of production. Civil liability for crop damage caused by cattle flows from the Stray Animals Act. A cattle owner is strictly liable for damages caused by his straying cattle.  This liability may possibly even be absolute and only an act of god may serve as a defence. The issue here is the quantum of the damage. The fact that the defendant was refused access to the plaintiff's property to repair the fence has no bearing on liability in this case. An independent adjuster assessed the damage at 557 bushels. The court found on the facts that the damage was caused exclusively by the defendant's cattle on several occasions.","The plaintiff's claim against the defendant was for crop damage sustained as a result of the defendant's cattle getting into the plaintiff's canola field late July 1999. The defendant admits that his cattle were in the plaintiff’s canola crop on one occasion but denies any liability under s.27 of the Stray Animals Act. HELD: Judgment in the amount of $2,533.45 was granted in favour of the plaintiffs, together with pre-judgment interest from January 2000 and costs. 1)The law in Saskatchewan is clear that a cattle owner is liable for such loss as is caused by the entry of his cattle onto the crop of another. The present s. 27(1) has been in the Act since 1977, when the Act was substantially re-written, apparently in response to the increasing urbanization of the province. Under both the present s27 (1) and the pre-1977 statutes, the legal situation was the same -- the cattle owner was strictly liable for damage caused by his straying cattle. 2)The plaintiff”s cattle were found to have caused the entire crop loss which the plaintiffs sustained. 3)The court found that the damages sustained by the plaintiffs were as follows:Total crop loss 557 bushels; price per bushel; value of crop loss $5.48; loss of $3,052.36."
"The accused applied for a stay of proceedings on the ground the Crown failed to provide adequate disclosure. In making disclosure, the Crown appended a copy of the respondent's criminal record to its affidavit. The defence then applied for a stay on the ground of perception of bias on the part of the Provincial Court judge because the respondent's criminal record was before her. The Crown appealed the order which prohibited the judge from continuing as trial judge in respect to the respondent's criminal charges of impaired driving, driving with blood alcohol levels exceeding .08, and dangerous driving. HELD: The appeal was allowed. The order for prohibition was quashed and the matter was remitted to the Provincial Court for trial. There is abundant authority that disclosure of an accused's criminal record to the court alone does not amount to an automatic disqualification of the court on the ground of apprehended bias, appearance of bias or other prejudice to the accused. The judgment in R. v. Peters is almost directly on point. The judge in this case said she had not read the record, she was not biased as a result of the information tendered at the pre-trial proceedings and the record was something she could put out of her mind as she did in all instances where she ruled evidence inadmissible. She was correct in these circumstances to dismiss the application for a stay and to decline to recluse herself.","This appeal is from an order prohibiting McMurtry P.C.J. from continuing as trial judge in respect of criminal charges against the respondent. She was charged with impaired driving, driving with a blood-alcohol level exceeding.08, dangerous driving and dangerous driving. HELD: The appeal is allowed, the order for prohibition is quashed, and the matter is remitted to the Provincial Court for trial. 1) The Crown did not have to disclose to the trial judge any indication of a criminal record. 2) The appeal must be allowed. 3) Judges of facts, whether they be juries or judges sitting alone, have a sworn duty to inform the court of their findings of fact. In this case, the Crown filed an affidavit to show that disclosure had been made.. The affidavit had appended as exhibits the items disclosed, among them, a copy of the criminal record of the respondent.. The Crown argued that the accused's criminal record cannot be put into evidence unless the accused takes the stand.. Once the judge heard the Crown's argument in respect to the Charter applications, the error should be ignored, or if it is deemed too significant to be ignored by the judge, the proceeding is adjourned."
"The wife sought an order for equal distribution of matrimonial property. They married in 1988, each for a second time, and separated in 1997. Each had significant assets at the time of the marriage, which had increased in value. They agreed at the time of the marriage to keep their assets separate and to not make a claim on the assets of the other and that their entire estates would be left to their respective children.  The wife argued the agreement was not applicable to the present situation where they have separated and was only in effect during the time of the marriage or upon their deaths. HELD: The wife was entitled to judgment for $54,000. 1)There was no conflict in the evidence as to the verbal agreement made at the time of the marriage nor as to their intention. This is an appropriate situation to apply s.40 of the Family Property Act. The fact they each executed a will to give effect to that intention and the husband paid practically all of the day-to-day expenses led to the conclusion their verbal agreement should be considered binding, notwithstanding their marriage ended by separation rather than death. 2)The condominium purchased by the husband was the 'family home' as provided for in s.2(1)(a). There was no extraordinary circumstance as provided in s.22(1), which would prevent equal division of the value of the family home. The Melville residence owned by the wife at the time of the marriage was exempt in accordance with their agreement. It had not increased in value and the wife solely paid its maintenance. 3)No costs.",The petitioner seeks an order for equal distribution of matrimonial property. The parties married in 1988 and separated in 1997. Each of the parties had significant assets at the time of the marriage which increased in value since that date. The respondent's assets then and in the years after the marriage were greater in value than those of the petitioner. HELD: 1)The respondent is entitled to judgment for half of the value of the assets acquired after marriage.  2)There is no 'extraordinary circumstance' as provided in s. 22(1) of the Act which would prevent the value from being divided equally between the parties. 3)The parties have a verbal agreement that after their deaths their entire assets would be left to their respective children. 4)The petitioner's assets have increased since the marriage. 5)The condominium purchased by the respondent to be the family home is exempt from distribution.
"Fulltext of judgment follows: [1] The appellant wife appeals the decision of the chambers judge varying the amount of child support and reducing the amount of arrears. She contends that the chambers judge erred in varying the order for maintenance and reducing the amount of arrears in the absence of evidence that there was a change in the conditions, means and needs of the respondent or the children as contemplated by s. 17(4) of the Divorce Act.[FOOTNOTE 1][2] The respondent contends that the amount of child support should be reduced by reason of his reduced income caused by his unemployment or reduced employment over the last four years. The appellant argues that the respondent has failed to satisfactorily explain his unemployment. There is evidence that his change in income is due to his own voluntary action and, as a result, he has failed to establish the threshold 'change in circumstances' which could result in a variation of the order. [3] The appeal is allowed and the decision of the chambers judge is set aside. There is evidence from which this Court can impute income to the respondent in the amount of $27,000, and the child support shall be varied to $510.00 per month as of February 1, 2004 in accordance with the Child Support Guidelines. The sum of $1,926.78 currently held by the Maintenance Enforcement Office shall be applied to the arrears. The respondent shall pay the sum of $200.00 per month on the arrears commencing April 1, 2004. [4] The appellant shall have her costs in the usual way.1R.S.C. 1985, c. 3 (2nd. Supp.).","The appellant wife appealed the decision of the chambers judge varying the amount of child support and reducing arrears in the absence of evidence that there was a change in the conditions, means and needs of the respondent or the children as contemplated by s. 17(4) of the Divorce Act.

"FIAT: In 1996, the respondent was ordered to pay $600 per month as child support for his daughter. He now applies to reduce his support obligation and rescind the arrears which have accumulated. HELD: 1) In 1999, the respondent sold his ownership interest in a business and retained a one-third interest. In 2001, he was terminated from his full-time employment as a result of an unexplained absence from work after he received a suspension for insubordination. Since his termination, he has not obtained full-time employment. He has continued to work seasonally 3 months a year and earn the gross amount of $21,000. The Court found that it is the respondent's choice to work a minimum amount each year. It has been said that individuals, who are subject to support obligations, are entitled to make decisions in relation to their careers as long as the decisions are reasonable at the time having regard to the circumstances. The respondent's decision to work only three months a year and to possibly return to school is not reasonable. 2) For the purposes of this application, the respondent's income was imputed to be $40,000 and he was ordered to pay $328 per month as support for his daughter. 3) The sharing of the s. 7 special expenses should be based on the respondent's imputed income. 4) A retroactive variation of child support is warranted. The respondent commenced his application for variation in June 2002 and the chambers judge was of the view that any variation of support should be retroactive to September 2002.  In light of the fact the respondent's previous support obligation was tax deductible/tax inclusive, the petitioner may in fact benefit from a retroactive variation as the child support she will receive, pursuant to this order, will be payable on a net of tax basis.  5) Rule 608(2) provides that a successful party will be entitled to costs of a family law proceeding unless, pursuant to Rule 608(3), the successful party has behaved unreasonably or has acted in bad faith. The difficulty in the matter before me is determining whether or not the respondent has been successful. Although his support obligation decreases, his previous payment was tax deductible while his ongoing payment will be net of tax. It is very likely that the respondent's financial position has not changed as a result of the order. The Court also had grave concerns respecting the substantial delays in the proceedings caused by the respondent's unwillingness to provide financial disclosure. Costs were awarded to the petitioner in the sum of $750, as the discovery motion would not have been necessary had the respondent provided appropriate financial disclosure.","FIAT: The father applies to reduce his child support obligation and rescind arrears which have accumulated under Archambault J.'s order. HELD: 1)Any sharing of s.7 special expenses should be based on the father's imputed income of $40,000. The father's income is, for the purpose of this application, imputed to be $21,000 and he should pay child support for Stephanie based on his current income. 2)The father's decision to work only 3 months of the year and/or return to school is not a reasonable decision when he has a continuing obligation to provide support for his child, Stephanie. 3)On all of the evidence, the father is underemployed. His choice to work a minimum amount each year and, if he should return, it will be his choice to attend school and severely limit his earnings for a significant period of time. In light of the fact that the father sold two-thirds of his business to two other partners, he may in fact benefit from a retroactive variation as the child support she will receive pursuant to the order will be payable on a net of tax basis."
"The applicant, having received a tentative subdivision approval, applied for final approval. In the meantime, the Municipality's road construction specifications had become more stringent and his proposal did not comply with the new specifications. The development officer found the application to be incomplete and the applicant applied for certiorari and mandamus. Certiorari granted; declaration issued that application for final subdivision approval was complete; order for mandamus granted and the development officer directed to issue final approval (subject only to the applicant correcting the technical error in the plan). The development officer's decision was based on interpretation of relevant legislation and the proper standard of review is correctness. The development officer misinterpreted the legislation. Since the applicant had already received tentative approval under the old regime, it did not have to meet the new higher standards for final approval. There was not another legal remedy open to the applicant equally convenient, beneficial and appropriate. The right of appeal under the legislation existed only from a refusal by a development officer and technically, this was not a refusal as the application was found incomplete. Both the right of appeal under the Act and the Board's power to grant an appeal were limited, either of which could result in the applicant having no remedy","The applicant land developer applied for and failed to receive final subdivision approval under the Municipal Government Act. The Municipality sought an order quashing the development officer’s decision to declare the application incomplete and a declaration that the application was in fact complete. The applicant sought mandamus to issue the final approval. The development officer refused, and the applicant appealed. Dismissing the application, that the right of appeal is from a refusal to approve a concept plan or tentative subdivision approved on the grounds that the decision of the municipality does not comply with the subdivision by-law. The application was incomplete for essentially two reasons: 1) it failed to meet the newly incorporated road standards; and 2) one of the bearings on the plan was missing. The municipality relied on s. 278 of the municipal Government Act in its submission that the higher road standards were applicable to the applicant. It was therefore technically not a refusal; the applicant was entitled to a declaration of final subdivision plan approval (again subject to non-contentious error in the plan) within two years of the date of the approval."
"The parties were married for 14 years and separated in 1995, entering into a detailed Separation Agreement in 1998. The two children of the marriage are 16 and 8 years of age. There was a long history of relatively short terms of employment and several moves to take employment. The respondent had a grade 12 education and some university courses but no practical skills or training. For the past 3 years, the respondent had made no reasonable efforts for employment, developed no skills of a practical nature, and derived her income from child support payments and the Child Tax Credit and by incurring debt in excess of $20,000.00 The parties had entered bankruptcy during the course of the marriage and had no assets or savings or pension entitlement at the time of separation or acquired since. The petitioner now earned an annual salary of $115,500.00. The Agreement did not address the level of child support in accordance with the Federal Child Support Guidelines, nor did it provide for practical retaining by the Respondent to facilitate employment. This was an exceptional situation that required some adjustment to the Agreement reached by the parties. The court ordered the establishment of a retraining fund of $6,500.00 with direct payments to whatever institution the Respondent may choose. Limited spousal support was to terminate on the earlier of completion of the retraining allowance or transfer of the balance of the outstanding to the Respondent on September 1st, 2001. An adjustment was also made to account for arrears in child support and child support payments.","The parties were married for 14 years and separated approximately 14 years later. The Petition for Divorce was issued in 1996 and it has taken over years to bring the matter to trial and over years since their separation. There have been a number of Interim Applications and Interim Orders. The Divorce Judgment will be issued forthwith. HELD: The Court found that the Agreement did not address the level of child support in accordance with the Federal Child Support Guidelines in effect nor did it provide a limited capacity or practical retraining by the petitioner to facilitate employment. The court found that this was an exceptional situation that required some adjustment with respect to the Agreement reached by the parties and filed May the 13th, 1998. It must be acknowledged that if the Agreement contained a level of support consistent with the federal child support Guidelines and had been in form acceptable to the Prothonotary Office, then quite probably the Divorce judgment would have been granted as of that date and the Corollary Relief Judgment would have also been issued."
"The Agency brought an application for a finding that the Respondent had abused a child, for the purposes of entering his name in the Child Abuse Register. The complainant described certain incidents that amounted to sexual assault when she was under the age of 16. The Respondent had previously been acquitted of charges based on the same allegations in criminal court. The Respondent has abused a child within the meaning of the Act. Although the standard of proof is on the balance of probabilities, it is elevated with the seriousness of the allegations and their implications. However, it is considerably less than proof beyond a reasonable doubt.","This is an application brought by the Agency for a finding that the respondent has abused a child as described in s. 62(a) or (b) of the Children and Family Services Act. HELD: The Court found that the accused had abused a young child within the meaning of s. 94(1)(b) and that the standard of proof was elevated with the seriousness of the allegations and its implications (considerably less, however, than proof beyond a reasonable doubt)."
"The plaintiff claims damages for injuries sustained when he was punched in the face and knocked unconscious by the defendant. Liability is admitted. The plaintiff applies for summary judgment pursuant to Rule 485 of the Queen's Bench Rules. The parties agree that damages should be assessed on the basis of the affidavit evidence. HELD: 1) The defendant pled guilty to a charge of assault causing bodily harm. He was sentenced to a fine of $1,500, placed on probation for 18 months and ordered to make restitution to the plaintiff for the cost of the dental work in the amount of $3,263.30. 2) The plaintiff suffered serious injuries and significant pain for a number of months after the assault. Extensive dental treatment was required and will be required at some point in the future. The plaintiff has minimal scarring. He is awarded general damages of $12,500. 3) The pleadings and the affidavit evidence do not support a substantial award for aggravated damages. However, the photographs graphically depict the extent to which his appearance was altered. Hurt feelings can reasonably be inferred from the fact that the plaintiff was rendered unconscious on the ground in a crowd of onlookers. These circumstances justify an award of aggravated damages in the sum of $2,000. 4) The plaintiff was awarded special damages in the amount of $1,911.70.","The plaintiff claims damages for injuries sustained in the assault. Liability is admitted and the plaintiff now applies for summary judgment and an assessment of damages pursuant to Rule 485. HELD: The plaintiff is awarded general damages of $12,500.00 plus pre-judgment interest of $1,911.70 plus costs and costs. 1)The plaintiff's affidavit graphically depict the extent to which his appearance was altered by his extensive facial injuries, perhaps more effectively than words could have done.. To some extent, as well, the requisite 'hurt feelings' can reasonably be inferred from the fact that the plaintiff was rendered unconscious on the ground in a crowd of onlookers. 2)The injuries sustained by the plaintiff as result of the defendant's assault were serious but not life threatening. Extensive dental treatment was required and further treatment will be required at some point in the future. The plaintiff has some minimal scarring and disfigurement but find that it is not significant. Excluding any component for aggravated damages, a fair award for general damages is $12.500."
"The Government seeks an order pursuant to Rule 164(4) of the Queen's Bench Rules requiring the plaintiff to provide better particulars in response to its demand for particulars and pursuant to Rule 173 of the Rules and order striking portions of the pleadings. HELD: 1) The plaintiff has failed to identify the legislative scheme by which responsibility for education in Ile a la Crosse or specifically, responsibility for education of a group of people that included the plaintiff, was delegated to the Minister of Education or any other member of executive government. The Government is entitled to know the case it has to meet. If the plaintiff knows the statute and regulations on which he relies, he must provide particulars. If he does not have particulars of the statutes and regulations, he must so state. 2) The court was not prepared to strike the phrases 'without limiting the generality of the foregoing' and 'without limitation'. The conduct of examination for discovery and undertakings can provide the defendant with particulars of allegations to be made by the plaintiff in order to permit it to properly defend the action.  3) The Government demanded full particulars of the breach of trust and breach of fiduciary duty. The plaintiff's response does not lay a foundation for either and the paragraphs are struck.  4) The court was satisfied that exemplary damages and punitive damages were synonymous and therefore only one of them should be pled to avoid confusion. The court directed that any reference to exemplary damages should be read as to include punitive damages and that only one phrase should be used. 5) As the cause of action clearly predates the coming into force of The Pre-judgment Interest Act, the provisions of that Act have no application to the plaintiff's claim.","The Government of Saskatchewan sought an order pursuant to Rule 164(4) of the Queen's Bench Rules requiring the defendant to provide better particulars in response to its demand for particulars, and in default of so doing striking the offending portions of the statement of claim. HELD: The Government was not prepared to strike the phrases complained of. The conduct of examinations for discovery and undertakings can provide the defendant with particulars of allegations to be made by the plaintiff in order to permit it to properly defend the action. The pleadings do not lay foundation for breach of trust and breach of fiduciary duty. The Government is entitled to know the case it has to meet."
"Accused pleaded guilty at opening of trial to one count of distributing child pornography in the form of written works. The accused was active on a pedophile website and posted 11 stories describing sexual activity between men and infants and pre-teen girls. HELD: Accused received 15 months imprisonment followed by 3 years of probation with addition orders including providing DNA samples and being added to the Sex Offender Registry. The Court accepted that the internet has led to the accelerated proliferation of child pornography, making it an increasing social problem. The social harm of such material is borne almost exclusively by infants and children, the most defenceless members of society. For this reason, denunciation and deterrence are the dominant sentencing principles. The defence submitted that the writings do not actually harm children in their making and, therefore, should not be subject to the same denunciation as pornographic images. The Court rejected this argument because it cannot be assumed that the writings do not stimulate the demand for images and since not all pedophiles are voyeurs only some will act on their desires and anything that stimulates this desire places children at risk in the real world. Aggravating factors in this case were 1) the fact that the accused extolled pedophilia and wrote hard core child pornography and encouraged others to the same. 2) The accused was a high profile contributor to the web site and he remains unrepentant Ã» he does not believe there is anything wrong with writing these stories and only stopped because the law requires it. A conditional sentence would not represent sufficient denunciation or deterrence. Mitigating factors in this case included a lack of criminal record, the guilty plea and the fact that the accused is looking after his elderly mother.","The defendant pled guilty at the opening of trial to distribution of child pornography contrary to s. 163.1(3) of the Criminal Code. HELD: The defendant was sentenced to 15 months imprisonment to be followed by a term of probation of 3 years, as well as the following additional orders: 1)A conditional sentence would not be a fit sentence on the facts. The defendant qualifies for the same to be imposed as a sentence of 2 years, and on the limited information available that he would not endanger the community if one were imposed. The mitigating factors were that the defendant had no criminal record, had no previous convictions, and did plead guilty albeit at trial, along with the other material referred to in the foregoing in arriving at what the Court considered to be the appropriate length of sentence. 2)The defendant was found guilty of distributing child pornography. The sentencing guidelines for the defendant were set out in R. v. Shelton. The judge found that a conditional sentence was not a fitting sentence on all the facts, although he agreed that the offences were related to the same sex trafficking offence. 3)The sentencing guidelines set out the defendant's motivation for distributing the child pornography and the circumstances of the offence. He did not believe there was anything wrong with writing such stories, but simply agreed to stop doing so because the law required it. 4)The sentence imposed was based on the mitigating factors referred to by the defendant, such as the fact that he did not have a criminal record and did not plead guilty to the charge. 5)The maximum sentence for distribution would not exceed 2 years. The sentence imposed on the defendant was 15 months incarceration, followed by 3 years probation, with the additional orders being made."
"The plaintiff applied under Queen's Bench Rule 231 to strike the statements of defence of a corporate and individual defendant for failure to attend scheduled examinations despite service of an appointment and payment of conduct money to their solicitor. The defendants had previously been permitted to re-open judgments obtained against them and had filed defences. Prior to that they had consistently failed to attend examinations in aid of execution. Contempt proceedings had been commenced against them but were adjourned sine die at the time the defendants were permitted to defend. The defendants resisted the application on the basis that they were now non-residents and not compellable by an appointment, and that the designated officer of the defendant corporation was no longer an officer. This information had not been communicated to the plaintiff's solicitor who had acted in good faith on information given to him previously by the solicitors for the defendants. The examinations had been scheduled unilaterally because the defendants' solicitor consistently refused or neglected to return phone calls or correspondence from the plaintiff's solicitors. HELD: The judge refused to strike the defences holding that in the circumstances Queen's Bench Rule 231 did not apply. He also held that the defendants, considering their conduct throughout the whole course of the lawsuit, were in contempt and ordered them to attend without conduct money any examinations unilaterally scheduled by the plaintiff failing agreement between counsel as to dates. Costs were fixed at $1,500 in any event of the cause and were ordered to be paid within two weeks.","The plaintiff applies to strike the statement of defence of the corporate defendant, Great Canadian Bingo Corp. on the ground that the designated officer of the corporation failed to appear at an examination for discovery on November 23, 1993. The plaintiff's solicitors had on several occasions telephoned the corporate defendants' solicitor to schedule examinations for discovery and to obtain statements as to documents. None of the calls were returned. The corporate defendant's solicitor subsequently wrote to the plaintiff's solicitor proposing a range of dates for the examinations and requesting that the individual defendant attend his scheduled examination, and that he secure the attendance of its proper officer at its scheduled examination. The defendant corporation, under Rule 231 of the Rules, is entitled to unilaterally set the dates. HELD: 1)On the basis of their conduct throughout the whole of these proceedings, the defendants were guilty of contempt of court. The contempt proceedings were still before the court even though they were adjourned sine die. The defendants abused the discretion of the court that was exercised in their favour to set aside the judgments obtained against them and to permit them to file defences.. 2)The non-attendance of the Dions on November 22, 1993, do not constitute'refusing or neglecting to attend' within the meaning of Rule 231.. It cannot be utilized respecting these particular non- attendances to strike their statements of defence."
"This was an appeal from the conviction of the appellant that he broke and entered a used car dealership and stole a vehicle, contrary to s. 348(1)(b) of the Criminal Code. The theft was reported to police by a passing motorist who saw the vehicle being driven off the car lot early in the morning. The vehicle was spotted on the highway, and when stopped, was exited by two individuals. Two officers followed tracks through a wooded area, and noted that in two areas the tracks broke through ice on a brook. Shortly thereafter the appellant came out of the woods on a nearby road; his lower body was wet and chunks of ice and snow clung to his clothing. The imprint of his footwear resembled that of the tracks in the snow. The appellant was convicted, based on the doctrine of recent possession. He argued there was no evidence he was in recent possession of the stolen vehicle. Dismissing the appeal, that there was sufficient evidence to support the findings of fact made by the trial judge. The judgment of the trial judge was consistent with R. v. Kowlyk (1988), 43 C.C.C. (3d) 1 (S.C.C.).","This was an appeal from a conviction for break, enter and theft for breaking and entering a used car dealership office and committing the theft of a 1994 Chev Blazer. Allowing the appeal, that although the evidence was circumstantial, the facts he found to be proved led to no other reasonable inference than the guilt of the appellant."
"An application pursuant to s197 of the Automobile Accident Insurance Act for an order setting aside SGI's termination of the applicant's income replacement benefits. The applicant suffered soft tissue injuries to his cervical spine when his vehicle was struck from behind by an uninsured driver. He received a partial income replacement benefit from SGI on the basis he was not able to perform some but not all of his farm duties. HELD: 1)SGI was not entitled to terminate Sawkiw's benefits pursuant to s185(d), (e), (f) or (g). SGI's failure to make a suitable rehabilitation program available to Sawkiw prior to October 1/97 and its failure to reassess his level of income replacement benefits as at September 14 where significant factors contributing to his desperate circumstances. SGI was requiring Sawkiw to attend daily physiotherapy of 3 to 4 hours duration with approximately 2-1/2 hours of additional travel time. It is common knowledge that pain can be exhausting; that daily physiotherapy can be exhausting; that daily travel of 2-1/2 hours can be exhausting; that the physical demands of farming can be exhausting; and, that the mental demands of managing a farm and coordinating and organizing the work of others on a farm can be exhausting. It was far from clear how SGI expected Sawkiw to devote approximately 6 to7 hours per day to his treatment program and still have the mental and physical reserves to devote any time or energy to his farming oprations. He could only reasonably be expected to participate in daily physiotherapy if he was receiving a full, rather than a partial income replacement benefit. 2)The benefits were properly terminated pursuant to s129(1)(e) the first day of his full time employment in Alberta. However, from September 14/97 to the date of termination Sawkiw was entitled to be paid full income replacement benefit without adjustment for a partial return to work. Sawkiw was entitled to the difference and interest from the date such additional benefits should have been paid until the date of this judgment. 3)SGI was to arrange for an assessment by the rehabilitation centre forthwith. If it is found that as a result of the accident Sawkiw is not able to hold the employment he held at the time of the accident, SGI is encouraged to consider his condition as a relapse under s142(1)(a). Under the terms of this judgment the final income replacement benefit will be other than one made pursuant to s139 or 140. 4)Sawkiw was entitled to his solicitor and client costs respecting services rendered and disbursements incurred from the date of filing his notice of motion to the date this judgment is received. He was also entitled to his costs associated with preparing and filing his notice of motion set at $600 being the maximum amount payable under the Personal Injury Benefits Regulations.","HELD: The application was granted. The termination of benefits was made pursuant to s. 185 of the Automobile Accident Insurance Act. The benefits were terminated by the respondent SGI on the basis that he was not able to perform some but not all of his farm duties. The court found that in accordance with s. 129(1)(e) of the Act, the benefits were properly terminated effective the first day of his employment in Alberta. The applicant was entitled to interest on any amount from the date of the termination until September 24, 1997. For reasons previously stated, for the period September 24 to October 23, 1997 the benefits should have been terminated. However, for reasons pre-judgment, the termination was properly set aside. HELD: 1)The applicant was awarded a partial income replacement benefit without adjustment for a partial return to work.  2)SGI was to pay the difference between the amount paid to the applicant and the amount required to be paid pursuant to the judgment.  3)The application was dismissed."
"Issues of divorce, custody and access were disposed of by judgment given during the course of the trial by consent of the parties. Matrimonial property was to be divided, maintenance for the children and spousal support were to be determined. HELD: 1)Access was to be mutually agreed upon with the 18 year old to whom the respondent stood in loco parentis.  2)Expert evidence of tax implications was not called as the respondent failed to give notice as required by the Rules of Court. 3)The mother's annual income for purposes of the Guidelines was fixed at $11,376 not including the $300 child support she received from the natural father of the 18 year old. The respondent's farming income was determined on a 3 year average as it varied from year to year. The facts justified adding back 25% of the capital cost allowance on the machinery over the last 3 years for Guideline purposes. Day care and play school costs of $440 per month were to be divided according to their proportionate share based on the Guidelines. The respondent was to pay one-half of the cost of extra curricular activities and any future activities as agreed upon. The approach used in Cook v. Kilduff was adopted and the amount for the two natural children was deducted from the amount payable for three children. One-half of the difference was added to the Guideline amount of support for the two children. 4)Spousal support was not ordered. The mother was employed and the respondent's income was not likely to increase in the near future. Given he paid child support and the extra costs, their income was nearly the same. 5)Of the six quarter sections owned by the respondent prior to marriage, there was no equity in one and the increase in value in the others was marginal. Credit was given for the reduction in the mortgage debt by $24,000. There was no interest to be divided in the 1999 crops. 6)The petitioner was awarded judgment for $113,155.19 less $15,580 for assets in her possession and less one-half the appraisal costs. The judgment was to be a charge on the respondent's land. The petitioner may apply for judgment for the amount of the loan secured by the van in her possession if the respondent fails to pay off the loan. 7)Each was to pay his or her own costs.","Divorce, custody and access were disposed of by judgments given during the course of the trial by consent of the parties. The issues for resolution were: 1) Divorce, Custody of the Children, Access to the Children and Maintenance of the Matrimonial Property. The petitioner was employed and the respondent was responsible for one-half of the $198,595.43 or $99,297.71. Given the fact that the respondent pays child support (including the extra costs) the income of the respondent and that of the petitioner will be nearly the same. 2) The respondent cannot be increased by adding back a capital cost allowance for the sole purpose of bringing him to a level of income which is artificial just so it might appear he has the ability to increase his net worth. The respondent's income is forecast to increase in the near future. The court declined to order any spousal support. 3) The petitioner's assets are valued at $101,967.19 less the sum of $15,580.00 (being the value of the assets in her possession) leaving a balance of $97,575.19 to be paid to the petitioner, less one half the costs of the appraisals. The judgment shall be a charge on the respondent's personal land."
"This was an application under the Charter of Rights and Freedoms for an order declaring that the mandatory retirement of the two appellant university professors was invalid and denied the rights of the appellants as guaranteed under ss. 15(1) and (7) of the Charter, and an order for reinstatement and back pay. Dismissing the application, that (1) pursuant to s. 32 of the Charter, the Charter did not apply to these employees since the university was not a subordinate body of government, and was not being controlled by government, but was an independent institution; the fact that the university's governing statute provided that teaching staff were 'deemed to be persons employed in the public service of the Province' for the purposes of their pension plan did not constitute governmental control such as to warrant the application of the Charter; and (2) the proper forum for this application was the Human Rights Commission. The court also considered the retroactive effect of the Nova Scotia decision in Sniders v. Nova Scotia (Attorney General), which struck down the provision in the Nova Scotia Human Rights Act precluding anyone 65 years or over from making an age discrimination complaint. The court concluded that the Sniders decision did have a retroactive effect to the date when s. 15 of the Charter came into force.","This was an application under s15(1) and (7) of the Charter of Rights and Freedoms for: an Order declaring that the mandatory retirement of the applicants by the respondent is invalid and infringes, denies and is inconsistent with the rights of applicants as guaranteed under the Charter and that the applicants be reinstated as full time members of the Faculty of the respondent immediately. The respondent pay to the applicants all compensation due to them as employees since the date of their mandatory retirement plus interest and costs of this proceeding. HELD: The application was dismissed. 1)The respondent is a wholly independent institution of post-secondary education which manages, administers and controls its property, revenue, business and affairs through its Board of Governors and administration department. 2)There is no evidence of governmental control that could be regarded as an exercise of government power sufficient to bring the respondent within the application of the charter. The only real relationship between the respondent and the Faculty Association is that of the collective agreement. The collective agreement is explicitly made applicable to the Crown. It is not subject to the Charter. 3)It is not likely to be applied in the courts except in cases where a discriminatory act is committed by legislative action, and the jurisdiction concerned does not have an overriding clause in its Human Rights Act."
"A jury determined the plaintiff was constructively dismissed from his employment as park superintendent in 1997 and awarded damages for failure to give reasonable notice. The defendant claimed the contract of employment was all inclusive; that the plaintiff exaggerated the amount of time he spent on the job in winter; that the reduced winter hours were not in lieu of overtime pay as he was a manager within the meaning of s.4(2) of the LSA; the doctrine of estoppel or waiver applied as he never claimed a right to holiday pay for 10 years and the employer relied on his not doing so; if the plaintiff is entitled to holiday pay he should only recover back to April 1990 as he is limited by the Limitation of Actions Act; it should not be based on wages plus truck allowance as wages as defined in the LSA does not include allowances for costs. The claim for unpaid holiday pay claimed from April 1988 to October 1997, based on his wages plus one-half his truck expense allowance, was reserved pending a decision by the Court of Appeal as to whether the Court of Queen's Bench has jurisdiction to determine the issue of entitlement to holiday pay. HELD: The claim was dismissed with costs.  1)The Court of Appeal held in Kolodziejski v. Auto Electric Service that the Queens' Bench has jurisdiction to entertain a civil action for non-payment of holiday pay. 2)The plaintiff may rely on s.30(1) of the LSA to establish he is entitled to holidays and on s.33 to establish he entitled to pay in lieu of taking holidays. The onus then shifts to the defendant to prove it complied with some exception in the LSA. Section 75 prevents an employee from waiving his or her entitlement. Whether the plaintiff asserted his right to holiday pay or not, he remained entitled to his annual holidays in accordance with the LSA. 3)The plaintiff can claim for any holiday pay in lieu of time off that he can establish he was entitled to from April 1990 to his termination date. Section 3(1)(f)of the LAA states that a cause of action for recovery of money under a contract, express or implied, must be commenced within 6 years of the date on which the cause arose. 4)The plaintiff clearly indicated that a portion of the truck allowance was made to avoid paying tax. As such it would be contrary to public policy for the Court to appear to endorse the plaintiff's actions by calculating his holiday pay on the basis of his wage and this portion of his truck allowance.  5)The defendant's position that the contract included a component of holiday pay each month was inconsistent with its position that the plaintiff took these days off as holidays during the year. The contract of employment did not include a component of holiday pay in lieu of time off.  6)Failure by the defendant to keep records for the purpose of inspection by the minister does not result in a reverse onus. The onus remains on the plaintiff to establish what holidays he did not take. 7)The plaintiff admitted to taking time away from his duties for personal time and for city business as mayor. The plaintiff was not there in his capacity as superintendent. Section 31(1)(b) indicates that an employee shall be permitted to take holidays in one uninterrupted period. The defendant allowed the plaintiff to take days off in any manner he chose. It was inconsistent that the plaintiff's failure to comply with the notice requirement meant for the benefit of the employer could be used by an employee to disclaim that his days off were holidays. 8)The plaintiff was clearly a manager within the meaning of LSA. Even if he were not a manager, he failed to prove, on a balance of probabilities that he worked overtime hours in excess of the statutory minimum in order to qualify for overtime. Any days off taken by the plaintiff could not be considered taken in lieu of overtime. The days he was away were holidays as defined in s.30 of the LSA. 9)He did not establish he did 3 weeks holidays.","The plaintiff sued for damages from the defendant alleging he was constructively dismissed from his employment with the defendant. The plaintiff elected to have the determination of liability and the assessment of damages determined by a civil jury. At the time of the jury trial, the issue of the defendant's jurisdiction to deal with entitlement to holiday pay was being determined by the Court of Appeal for Saskatchewan.. The plaintiff asserted that the defendant complied with some exception in the Labour Standards Act. The defendant claimed that if the court found that the plaintiff's contract was not all-inclusive or that it did not exceed the minimum standards set out in the LSA, the plaintiff should only be entitled to recover back to April 1990 as the plaintiff is limited by the Limitation of Actions Act. HELD: The plaintiff was awarded damages for loss of his truck allowance. 1) The plaintiff can rely on a presumption arising out of a requirement in a LSA to meet his burden to establish his damage. Any holiday pay owing to the plaintiff will be calculated only on the plaintiff’s wage. 2) The court reviewed the various claims made by the defendant in relation to the claim for holiday pay and found that they were all reasonable and proportionate to the amount owed by the plaintiff. 3) There was no evidence that any of the claims were made against the defendant based on the fact that the truck allowance was part of his wage and the plaintiff was a “manager” within the meaning of s. 4(2) of the Labour SA and therefore not entitled to overtime. 4) There were several preliminary issues which must be dealt with at this stage: the defendant asserted that it would be substantially prejudiced if the plaintiff were now allowed to assert that right. It would be of course for the wronged plaintiff to prove his claim for unpaid holiday pay. 5) If the court finds that the plaintiffs’ holiday pay is insufficient to recover from April 1990, it is of course, for the defendant to rebut the presumption arising from the wording of the Act, which only allows recovery of money under a contract up to 6 years after the cause of action arises. 6) The Court reviewed the pleadings and the issues, both factual and legal, with respect to the entitlement to holidays. 7) The defendant argued that the award of damages in lieu of proper notice should be commensurate with the amount awarded by the jury. 8) The jury awarded the plaintiff damages in the amount of $1,000."
"The plaintiff was injured in a motor vehicle accident in Quebec and commenced an action in Nova Scotia. The applicant applied to determine whether the plaintiff was barred from suing in Nova Scotia concerning the Quebec accident and to dismiss the action on the basis that Nova Scotia was a forum non conveniens. Application to dismiss the action dismissed; the forum conveniens is Nova Scotia. The plaintiff has the prima facie right to select the forum subject to the defendant's right to establish that the forum is non conveniens. In the absence of many facts about the circumstances surrounding the accident and the witnesses likely to be called by the defendant, Nova Scotia is the forum conveniens. The substantive law governing the proceeding will be the law of the place where the accident occurred and the governing procedural law will be the law of the place of the trial.","The application was for directions as to procedure to govern the future course of conduct of trial, in the alternative to determination of a question of law and, secondly, to dismiss the action because Nova Scotia is a forum non conveniens. The only issue was whether the plaintiff was barred from suing in Nova Scotia regarding the motor vehicle accident which occurred in the Province of Quebec. HELD: The application was granted with costs. The notice of application was amended to include an additional claim for costs. There was an entirely different question as to what law will apply to a trial in a province of Quebec and, as I have previously stated, the rule is that the substantive law that governs will be the law of the place where the accident occurred. If there is a procedural problem, a problem arising from procedural law, before or during trial, that problem will undoubtedly be determined in accordance with the procedural law of that place."
"The plaintiff bought a house. She used the services of Cecilia Mui, a realtor associated with the defendant 100% Realty Associates Ltd. operating as Re/max Saskatoon. The house was purchased from the defendants Edward and Verl Karpinski. The vendors' realtor was the defendant, Mario Jacobucci, owner of the defendant Trevi Holdings Ltd. The house did not meet the plaintiff's expectations. She now sues the defendants seeking recovery of damages for alleged latent defects. She claims Ms. Mui fell below the standard of care required of a realtor representing a purchaser. She claims Ms. Mui was negligent in misrepresenting certain facts and breached the fiduciary duty expected of her. The plaintiff claims the Karpinskis misrepresented facts to her, negligently and fraudulently. The plaintiff claims that Mr. Jacobucci and his company are liable to her in damages, both in negligence and as parties to the misrepresentations made by the vendors. Special and general damages are claimed as are aggravated damages and punitive damages. The trial took place over 22 days, spanning several years and included testimony from 14 witnesses. Two main issues are raised. The first is the liability of each of the defendants. The second issue is quantum of damages. The credibility of the parties is at the forefront of the determination of the issues. HELD: The vendors are liable to the plaintiff for breach of contract. Each of the defendants is a tortfeasor, each having breached an obligation or duty owed to the plaintiff, whether through negligence or misrepresentation. Their wrongful acts and omissions all contributed to the same damage. In that respect their liability is concurrent. The liability of the vendors and Mr. Jacobucci is joint, and that of Ms. Mui is several. As concurrent torfeasors, the fault for the damage shall be apportioned equally among the four of them.  1) Credibility is not a science, see R. v. Gagnon, 2006 SCC 17. It is not always possible to articulate with precision the complex intermingling of impressions that emerge after watching and listening to witnesses and attempting to reconcile the various versions of events. The principles and tools to be used in assessing credibility are summarized in Novak Estate (Re), 2008 NSSC 283. 2) Certain of the evidence of the Karpinskis and Ms. Mui is so unreliable that the whole of their evidence is cast with doubt. 3) The opinions and conclusions of Mr. Loraas and Mr. Epp are accepted by the court. They are professionals with no interest in the outcome of the action. Their evidence was largely unchallenged. The Court finds that the pine shakes were rotten, sealant had been applied to the shakes on at least two occasions and prior to the plaintiff offering to buy the property, the shakes were not properly installed allowing water to seep into the house, the skylight leaked and caulking had been applied to stop the leaking before the plaintiff offered to buy the house, there was improper and inadequate venting which resulted in moisture damage to the interior of the house and mold in the attic, the moisture damage in the house included damage to drywall and paint blisters. Nail pops throughout the house were largely the result of the house being moved. No inspection was done after the house was moved. 4) The Court finds the Karpinskis did not speak truthfully or completely when they answered the questions in the Property Condition Disclosure Statement (PCDS). The Court does not accept that the vendors were not aware of water and moisture damage arising from the improperly installed shingles, the missing ridge caps, the leaking skylight or the lack of venting. The sealant on the roof was sufficiently old to predate the plaintiff's purchase of the house. The vendors repaired the sink holes and moisture pockets and effectively concealed the problems. It should have been disclosed. Although the vendors denied knowing of the structural damage to their house, they knew the house had been cut in half and moved 300 kilometers and had sustained damage. The structural problems were concealed by the vendors through repairs to the dry wall, reinforcement at stress points, and repainting and patching of wall paper. The fact that the house had been cut in half and moved should have been disclosed on the PCDS. 5) It is not only current defects or ongoing problems that need to be disclosed on a PCDS. A prospective purchaser does not look to the PCDS only to ascertain that the roof is not leaking on the day it was signed, see Kaufmann v. Gibson, [2007] O.J. No. 2711 (Ont. S.C.) (QL). The Karpinskis are liable to the plaintiff for breach of contract for failing to disclose the existence of structural defects, damage due to water and roof leakage. The terms of the PCDS formed part of the agreement between the parties and the deliberate withholding of this information amounted to a false representation as to the condition of the home. With respect to damage arising from these defects, the doctrine of caveat emptor does not apply. 6) The requirements for negligent misrepresentation have been established by the plaintiff. The failure to disclose, or silence as to a known defect, amounts to an act of concealment of a material fact and has the same effect as an express misrepresentation and is sufficient to attract liability, Thomas v. Blackwell, 1999 SKQB 168. 7) The false representations knowingly made by the vendors and their silence as to material facts were fraudulent. 8) Ms. Mui was negligent and her conduct and advice to the plaintiff fell below the standard of care expected of a realtor acting for the purchaser of a rural property in 1999. She did not conduct any preliminary background checks with the Rural Municipality, which would include determining if proper permits had been obtained, prior to the plaintiff's offer to purchase. Ms. Mui did nothing more than merely mention a home inspection to the plaintiff on one occasion. At no time did she recommend a home inspection even after she knew the house had been moved and before the condition regarding a satisfactory PCDS was removed. Another reason to strongly recommend a home inspection would be in circumstances where the realtor knew that a rural municipality did not require building inspections and Ms. Mui knew this to be the case. The plaintiff relied on the representation of Ms. Mui to her detriment. Had Ms. Mui disclosed all material facts to the plaintiff and explained and recommended a home inspection, the Court is satisfied that the outcome for the plaintiff would have been different. Knowing the house had been moved and had not been inspected the plaintiff would have most likely reconsidered her decision to purchase. 9) The Court is satisfied that Mr. Jacabucci is liable to the plaintiff for negligent misrepresentation. He represented that the home was of 'quality construction'. This was incorrect. Mr. Jacobucci was also complicit in, and party to, the negligent misrepresentations made by the vendors in the PCDS. He knew the house had been moved and sustained damage. He also knew the skylight leaked. The plaintiff relied on these misrepresentations and damages resulted.  10) The costs incurred by the plaintiff to repair the house total $17,613. She is awarded $15,000 as compensation for personal time and effort that she expended in repairing the home. There is no evidence that the distress the plaintiff experienced constituted a physical injury, or a recognized psychiatric illness and she cannot be compensated for mental distress, whether under tort or breach of contract. She is awarded $10,000 for aggravated damages. Her claim for punitive damages is dismissed. Her claim for solicitor and client costs is dismissed. Corrigendum received dated December 3, 2009 and added to fulltext.","The plaintiff, now Sylvia Schira, decided to purchase a home. She hired the services of a realtor associated with the defendant, 100% Realty Associates, which operated as RE/MAX Saskatoon. After a lengthy search, the plaintiff purchased the property in 1998. The realtor, Cecilia Mui, was hired to assist her with the purchase of the property. She claimed that the defendants fell below the standard of care required of the realtor and breached the fiduciary duty expected of her. She also claimed aggravated damages against all defendants and punitive damages against Mr. and Mrs. Karpinski for failing to provide a Property Condition Disclosure Statement (PCDS) which formed a condition of the contract for sale. HELD: The plaintiff sues the defendants seeking recovery of damages for alleged latent defects in the house.  1) The first time the plaintiff visited the property was in 1998 and she purchased a country home (which was owned by the defendants) and rented it to her for several years. The second time, in 1999, she bought a house (which had been previously listed for sale at $299,000 with possession date of August 6, 1999) but was unable to obtain a copy of the PCDS due to a power failure in the home. The PCDS was not incorporated into the agreement. 2) The house did not meet the requirements of the rural municipality. There was no discussion about home inspection. The home was too expensive for the plaintiff to afford. It was too small for her to afford it. It would not be good for her if she had to pay more for it. 3) The court found that the plaintiff was not entitled to any of the costs associated with this transaction. The court awarded the plaintiff $250,000 for the home and $350,000 to the defendants for the same amount of money. 4) The plaintiff was awarded $1,000,000.00 for the house and $2,500,000 in general damages based upon mental and emotional distress.  5) The Court awarded the defendant $1.5 million in punitive damages and $1 million in interest. 6) The defendant was found to be liable to the plaintiff in damages, both in negligence and as parties to the misrepresentations made by the plaintiff. The Court found the defendant to be guilty of breach of contract. The defendant is also found liable in damages in negligence."
Defendants brought an application for an order setting a date for the plaintiffs' application for certification of the class action. The plaintiffs had failed to meet the litigation schedule by failing to deliver their written arguments and authorities and had not applied for an extension. HELD: The order of the Court established a timeline for the plaintiffs certification application and set a hearing date.,"FIAT. The defendants apply for an order setting a date for the hearing of the plaintiffs' application for an Order certifying this action as a class action pursuant to The Class Actions Act as am. HELD: Although the time lines established by the court have expired, there will be an order granting leave to the plaintiffs to serve and file an application extending the times within which steps may be taken leading up to the Hearing of the Plaintiffs' certification motion. If such an application is made, it shall be: (a) Served and filed on or before August 27, 2010;(b)Made returnable on September 23, 2010 at 10:00 a.m. or such other date as may be designated by the Court on application by the plaintiffs; and(c)Provided for a hearing on the certification motion to be held on February 18, 2011."
"Wills and Estates – Executors – RemovalCivil Procedure – Wills and Estates – Applications – Requirements The applicant applied for an order that the respondents renounce their right to probate the last will of the deceased testator, Anne Reiter, or in the alternative, for an order that they be terminated as executors of her estate. The testator died in January 2015 and application for probate had not yet been made. The deceased’s will had bequeathed all her property to her husband, Michael Reiter, who died in October 2015. The respondents were named executors of his estate. A simultaneous application had been brought by the same applicant to remove the respondents as executors of his estate (see: 2016 SKQB 15). The applicant had failed to serve the respondents with notice of this application or the alternate executor and beneficiaries named in the will. In addition, the applicant had misunderstood that she could rely upon evidence filed in another action that was also before the court in this application. HELD: The application was adjourned. The applicant was instructed to serve notice of the application and the adjournment on the alternate executor and the named beneficiaries. As the applicant had not understood that evidence from another action could not be considered by the court on this application, the applicant was also required to file further affidavit evidence. She was instructed to serve the material on the respondents, the alternate executor and the beneficiaries.","The applicant applies for an order that the respondents, Yvonne Powell and Yvette McLachlan, renounce their right to probate the last will and testament of the deceased and for an ordered that they be terminated as executors of the estate for the period of January 2015 to the date that they cease to be executors. HELD: The application is adjourned to February 3, 2016 at 9:00 a.m. The court ordered that the applicants prepare a notice of adjourned application. 1)The respondents have failed to provide an adequate accounting for the estate of Anne Reiter. 2)The applicant has failed to serve all those persons who are interested in this application which include the alternate executor under the will and all named beneficiaries."
"Statutes – Interpretation – Limitation of Civil Rights Act, Section 2The appellants had granted a residential mortgage in favour of the respondent that secured a loan in the amount of $460,800. The loan was a consolidation of existing debt, part of which was the balance of $373,089 owed on the original loan that had enabled the appellants to purchase the land. The remaining $87,711 was non-purchase money financing approved by the respondent. The appellants fell into default, and the respondent commenced foreclosure proceedings when the balance owed had increased to $536,186. The property was sold through judicial listing orders and the net sale proceeds were paid to the respondent. As the proceeds were insufficient, the respondent sought an order entitling it to the deficiency. The Chambers judge considered s. 2 of The Limitation of Civil Rights Act (LCRA) and held that the amount of the deficiency should be $162,675.99. The issues on appeal were how the proceeds of sale should be applied against the mortgage balance and what the proper amount of the deficiency was. HELD: The appeal was allowed. The court reviewed the purpose and policy behind the LCRA. It then examined its conflicting decisions in Hrynewich Holdings and Andrews and held that the latter was a per incuriam judgment and therefore not binding and the approach set out in Hrynewich would guide the disposition of this appeal. Therefore, it found with respect to each issue that the holding in Hrynewich meant that payments should be allocated on a pro-rated basis to purchase money and non-purchase money debt balances and the proper amount of the deficiency to which the respondent was entitled to judgment against the appellants was $31,160.23.","This appeal concerns the application of s. 25 of the Limitation of Civil Rights Act in relation to a motion for deficiency judgment by the respondent bank. The main issue relates to how the proceeds of sale of property by judicial listing should be applied against mortgage balance when there are both purchase money and non-purchase money balances. The respondent bank argued the Chambers judge was correct and that it was entitled to rely upon the land it held as security to recover the purchase money portion of the loan and then pursue Mr. Andrew on his personal liability. HELD: Appeal allowed. 1) The Chambers judge pro-rated the calculation of the deficiency judgment pursuant to the percentage owing on the mortgage balance. 2) Hrynewich Holdings accords with the policy behind the legislation as set out in this judgment. 3) The respondent is entitled to take out a deficiency judgment against the appellants in the amount of $31,160.23. The decision in Andrew (CA) was not binding and was instructive when interpreting the spirit and intent of the LCRA."
"After a series of pre-trial conferences, and the exchange of some correspondence between the parties lawyers, the husband took the position that the parties had reached a binding agreement as to the value of his pension. The wife disagreed and a trial of this issue was directed and determined in the husband's favour. The wife appealed. HELD: Appeal allowed.  1)Since the judgment of this Court in Childs v. Childs Estate, [1988] 1 W.W.R. 746, there is no doubt that a judge has the power, under Rule 7 of s. 44 of The Queen's Bench Act, R.S.S. 1978, c. Q-1, to enforce or set aside an agreement compromising an action by summary proceedings. The law as stated in that judgment applies as well to agreements or settlements reached during the course of pre-trial conferences. 2)Parties will not usually intend to settle selected issues on a piecemeal basis, but rather will reach tentative agreements on selected issues conditional on an overall settlement agreement being concluded. Such was the parties' intention in this case, and accordingly, there was no settlement contract for the judge in the court below to enforce.  3)This is not to say that parties cannot reach several separate independent, binding and enforceable agreements as part of an effort to reach an overall settlement of the matters in issue between them, but in order to do so, the intention of the parties to settle on a piecemeal or installment basis must be clear. Nothing in the evidence indicated such an intention in this case. 4)In cases of settlement agreements reached at a pre- trial conference, the application to enforce, or to set aside, should be made under Rule 7 of s. 44 of The Queen's Bench Act as was done in Childs and not under Rule 184A as was the developing practice.","This was an appeal from an order that determined after trial that the parties had reached a binding agreement as to the value of the respondent's pension plan during negotiations which took place during a series of pre-trial conferences. HELD: The appeal was allowed from the bench with brief written reasons to follow. 1)The parties cannot reach several separate independent, binding and enforceable agreements as part of an effort to reach an overall settlement of the matters in issue between them, but in order to do so, the intention of the parties to settle on a piecemeal or instalment basis must be clear. 2)The fiat ended: Pre-trial for continuation with respect to maintenance, jewellery and debts of the wife was adjourned sine die.  3)The court reviewed the evidence and concluded that the respondent was to produce a statement of his pension plan as of the date in question."
"The respondent applied to reduce on-going maintenance from $600 per month for his two children and to reduce the accumulated arrears of approximately $14,600. The original corollary relief was made in 1989. An application for variation was dismissed in 1993 except that an order suspending the enforcement of the arrears during the times the respondent was unemployed was granted. The petitioner who had custody of the children and resided in Manitoba was employed. She requested that the matter be dealt with summarily on affidavit evidence and did not want a trial of the issue. HELD: The respondent was to pay $300 per month per child in the months when his gross earnings are $2,200 or greater and $150 per month per child when they are less. Arrears were reduced by $7,000. When he earned more than $2,200 per month he was to pay $200 per month on arrears in addition to the on-going child support obligation. The 1993 order was continued and it was further ordered that the respondent file quarterly a financial statement or cheque stubs evidencing his income with the maintenance enforcement office. 1)There was a significant reduction in the respondent's income since 1994, therefore there was a material change in circumstances. 2)The respondent had not provided specific information about the number of months he was in receipt of social assistance. It was clear, however, that his income during 1995 and 1996 did not allow him to meet his support obligations. Since his employment was uncertain a flexible order was appropriate.","The father applied to reduce the amount of on-going maintenance of $600 per month for his 2 daughters. The corollary relief judgment was made in 1989 except that an order suspending enforcement of arrears during periods when the respondent was unemployed was granted. HELD: The father was ordered to pay child support of $300 per month per child during months when his gross income was $2,200 or greater and $150 per month during years of unemployment. Arrears were reduced by $7,000. He proposed that his support obligation. be eliminated or at least reduced during his months of unemployed. Counsel suggested that the obligation be reduced by one-half."
"Revenue Canada, which was owed $166,359.72 for goods and services tax for 1991-92 and $14,223.30 for 1991 unpaid personal income tax, and the Michaluks, who were owed $58,720.34 for a failed agreement and lease on their property in Manitoba, objected to the automatic discharge of the bankrupt. The bankrupt contended that s241 of the Income Tax Act prohibits disclosure of tax information concerning both the bankrupt's common law spouse and the company of which she was sole director and shareholder. The second preliminary issue raised was that portions of an affidavit were based upon information and belief as opposed to personal knowledge as required by Queen's Bench Rule 319 for a final matter. HELD: A conditional order of discharge issued requiring the bankrupt to pay $1,750 from any source to the trustee by monthly installments of $100 per month. Judgment interest would accrue on any arrears.  1)This discharge hearing related to Nick Morin. The relevance of the tardiness in remitting goods and services tax of his common law spouse's company was questionable. The information was confidential and disclosure would be improper for these proceedings. The principle and exemption contained in s295(5)(a) of the Excise tax Act would not allow disclosure of goods and services tax remittances in these proceedings. 2)None of the alleged facts raised pursuant to ss173(1)(a),(b),(d),(f) and (m) were proved. It was not proven as outlined in s173(1)(f) that the bankrupt put them through unnecessary expenses by a frivolous and vexatious defence to the action. The conclusion of the investigation conducted by the RCMP as a result of the superintendent's investigation order was that the evidence would not support a successful prosecution.","Two creditors objected to the automatic discharge of the bankrupt's bankruptcies common law spouse and the company that she was sole director and a shareholder of. The bankrupt applied for a discharge under Queen's Bench Rule 319, arguing that the principles and exemption contained in s.172(1)(a) of the Excise Tax Act would allow disclosure of goods and services tax remittances of Clearsky Enterprises Ltd.. The bankrupt submits that this is a final matter and Rule 319 requires affidavit evidence must be based upon information and belief as opposed to personal knowledge. HELD: Appeal dismissed. 1)The bankrupt's application for a conditional discharge was dismissed. 2)The court found that the fact disclosed in paragraph 19 of the Affidavit of James Douglas Cook was confidential and would not be considered in the determination of the proper discharge order. 3)The Court found that there had not been a breach of the Trustee's duty to report to the trustee. 4)The Trustee was awarded a conditional order of discharge of $1,750 per month commencing May 1/98 until paid in full."
"The parties were divorced two years ago and the matter had been finalized by an appeal decision in June, 1999. Both parties made application to vary child support on the basis of changes (ups and downs) in the farming business. The respondent wife, who recently purchased a house, also applied for lump sum spousal support which claim had been disallowed by the Court of Appeal. Monthly spousal support terminated as wife now self-sufficient; child support increased due to increase in husband's income; lump sum payment of $8,000 awarded to wife to help pay her relocation expenses from move with husband given six months to pay lump sum, but monthly spousal support to continue until the $8,000 was paid in full. Applications to vary should not be entertained simply because of the usual ups and downs of the farming business; the court must strive to average out the individual's ability to pay in such circumstances in order to ensure stability of payments for both parties. Lump sum spousal support payments must not have the effect of a significant redistribution of the division of matrimonial property but the reasons for the belated application must be examined.","The parties applied to vary spousal and child support less than two years after being divorced and less than one year after the Court of Appeal decision which settled the support awards of the trial judge. HELD: 1) The parties had made counter applications to vary the Corollary Relief Judgement dated November 16, 1998, and June 4, 1999, resulting from the trial decision of Justice Hall in 1998 and the Appeal decision in June 1999.  2) The respondent sought to increase child support at the current level, at least until 2002. She also sought a lump sum award of $20,000 to reimburse her for relocation expenses. 3) Considering the moving expenses and the tax consequences of cashing in RRSP's and other expenses such as furniture, etc., the court found that the respondent had now achieved self-sufficiency. 4) The Court ordered the lump sum support to continue until the $8,000 lump sum was paid because that money is required by the respondent to meet her immediate requirements. 5) In the circumstances there is a current need for a lump-sum award to compensate the respondent for her relocation expenses for the reasons mentioned above. The respondent has not made any effort to change her position with the Royal Bank of Canada. She is a farmer subject to the ups and downs of the farming business. She has not been able to establish a reasonable need at this time. Her income has improved since the trial in 1998 primarily because better up to date financial information is now available and because of the respondent's receipt of significant farm aid. She claims material change in circumstances based on his poor farming results in 1999 and his improved employment and income situation. Otherwise the effect could be a significant redistribution of the matrimonial property division. 6) There was no evidence the respondent would have the ability to pay the increased child support ordered in the divorce. The Court found that she could not establish a'reasonable need' at the time of the divorce hearing. She claimed that she should not have to use the assets or RRSPs she received on the basis that she planned to buy a home in the near future for which she would need $5,000 for down payment and for moving expenses, etc.. The respondent would not be able to pay that amount. 7) The lump sum awards were not justified. The court found the respondent could not afford to pay more than the lump- sum award. 8) The court ordered the respondent receive $8.000 per month in spousa."
"The issue is the amount of child support payable by the respondent. The respondent's income as reported in his income tax return for the past 3 years has been in the $70,000 range. However, he is also the sole shareholder of a corporation and the 50% owner of another corporation. The corporations have been very profitable and the retained earnings of both companies far exceed the amount of long term debt. HELD: 1) The respondent has deemed additional income of $50,000 and $27,200 from the two companies. 2) The imputed annual income of the respondent is $150,000. 3) Costs in the amount of $750 to the petitioner.","The issue between the parties is the amount of child maintenance payable by the respondent to the petitioner for the benefit of Brady Melvin, born January 9, 1993. The amount of the respondent's income, as reported in his income tax return for the years 2001, 2002, and 2003 was $71,501.00, $73,272.00 and $74,476.00.. He has asserted that the indebtedness of the company is $1,600,000. However, nearly $600,00 of that debt represents shareholders loans.. The long term debt of Canadian Well Servicing Ltd., as of May 31, 2004, was deducted before calculation of retained earnings."
"The tenants apply pursuant to s. 49(2) of The Residential Tenancies Act for leave to appeal a decision of the Court of Queen's Bench reviewing a decision of the Rentalsman. HELD: Application allowed.  1) The parties agree that the rent for July was paid on July 27. The landlord then immediately applied for and was granted a writ of possession. 2) The tenants advise that the landlord holds the equivalent of one month's rent as security for the payment of the last month rent of the tenancy. The landlord claims it is a security deposit. 3) The tenants claim they tendered the arrears on the basis that the landlord would not apply for a writ of possession and that the arrears were accepted on that basis. 4) The Court of Queen's Bench Chambers judge dismissed the appellant's appeal the same day saying 'the rent for August has not been paid and not paid by required time, appeal is dismissed'. 5) The first issue on appeal is whether the Chambers judge erred in finding the Rentalsman had jurisdiction to make the order granting possession on the basis that 'the rent was 15 days in arrears when the Notice of Termination of the tenancy agreement was served and the tenant has failed to vacate the premises in accordance with the Notice' if the landlord accepted the rent in lieu of seeking a writ of possession. The second issue on appeal is whether the Chambers judge erred in considering that the subsequent month's rent was not paid.","The tenants apply pursuant to s.49(2) of The Residential Tenancies Act for leave to appeal a decision of the Court of Queen's Bench reviewing a decision by the Rentalsman. HELD: Application allowed. 1)Did the Chambers judge err in considering that the subsequent month's rent was not paid?  2)The rent was 15 days or more in arrears when the Notice of Termination of the tenancy agreement was served and the tenant has failed to vacate the premises in accordance with the Notice. Based on the evidence provided, the Landlord's claim has been sufficiently proven and that an Order should be made placing the landlord in possession of the rental premises."
"The Crown asks that the accused youth be detained. The Crown concedes that there is no reason to detain the accused youth to ensure her attendance in court or to prevent further occurrences. The Crown asks that she be detained because the crime is so horrible, the case is so strong and the public in La Ronge are so disturbed and shocked by the occurrence that to release the youth would cause a loss of confidence in the administration of justice. HELD: The court does not keep a person in custody simply because they are accused of committing an offence. There must be a necessary and substantial reason to keep a person in custody before they have a trial. The accused youth will be released on strict conditions that will continue until her trial is complete.","HELD: The youth was released on strict conditions which will continue until her trial. The Crown conceded that there was no reason to detain her in custody to ensure her attendance in court, before anyone has given evidence against her, under oath, in a court of law and before she has had a chance to defend herself at a trial. In effect, the Crown says that because several persons have told the police that the accused youth committed a serious offence, I should confine her to custody even before her trial, before any evidence has been given against her in a Court of Law, and before her defence is given. The public in La Ronge and area are so disturbed and shocked by the occurrence, that to release the youth would cause a loss of confidence in the administration of justice on the part of the public.. HELD: 1)The public is aware that every person is presumed to be innocent until they are accused of committing an offence. There must be a necessary and substantial reason to keep a person in custody before they have a trial.. 2)If the youth is convicted at trial, the public will be aware that the appropriate sentence, according to law, will be imposed.. The police have investigated and are still investigating the circumstances surrounding the injuries to the victim and the legal process is underway. There is no evidence at all that this youth will be danger if released, or that her release will cause any other danger to the community. 3)The Public is aware of the Public's Awareness that we do not keep someone in custody simply because they are charged with an offence; there must be an appropriate sentence according to the law. If the youth was convicted at the trial, there is no need to keep her locked up until she has a trial; the Crown has conceded that the Crown is not a party to the Criminal Justice Act. 4)The youth will continue to be in strict conditions and continue to continue to remain in custody until the trial."
"The two accused entered a guilty plea to committing an assault causing bodily harm contrary to s. 267(b) of the Criminal Code. HELD: A fine plus a probation order with strict condition can accomplish the principles of sentencing. Each accused is fined $1,500 with a probation order for two years. Corrigendum received dated March 19, 2010 and added to fulltext.","The accused entered a guilty plea to committing an assault causing bodily harm contrary to s. 267(b) of the Criminal Code. The accused had a previous criminal record, but did not file a victim impact statement, instead choosing to rely on the information contained in the pre-sentence reports in relation to each accused.. The accused claimed his injuries were greater than those presented by the Crown, and the accused minimized their involvement and culpability for the offence. HELD: The court imposed a fine of $1,500 plus a probation order for 2 years. The court directed that the accused comply with the terms of the probation order. The Court ordered that the victim impact statements be adduced, as they are subject to the general provisions of s. 724(3). Taking into consideration both the aggravating and the mitigating circumstances, the principles of sentencing, the facts and the circumstances of the accused, the court cannot conclude that incarceration in a facility is an appropriate disposition in the circumstances."
"The plaintiff filed a number of duplicate claims on behalf of a number of individuals. The issue was whether the claims should be issued. HELD: Section 7(1) of The Small Claims Act provides that a Provincial Court Judge acts as a gatekeeper to insure that claims comply with the Act before they are issued. In this role, the Provincial Court judge is exercising a quasi judicial function. Counsel for the plaintiff has clearly indicated that the claim is a test case. The plaintiff seeks declaratory relief. A substantial amount of the claim involves an allegation of breach of contract, but neither the plaintiff nor the proposed defendants were signatories to the contract. Accordingly, they would not be entitled to the benefit of the agreement. As virtually all of the potential issues raised by these claims are declaratory in nature, they are outside the jurisdiction of the Provincial Court. Any litigation over these issues must be done in the Court of Queen's Bench.","The plaintiff sought to have summonses issued for matters that were, prima facie, outside the jurisdiction of the Provincial Court. Dismissing the summons, that the court refused to issue the summons for reasons provided in the Interim Ruling. The issue was whether or not to issue summonses pursuant to s. 7(4) of The Small Claims Act. The issues raised by the claims were important issues to the potential Plaintiffs and may well be worth litigating, but that litigation, in my view, must be done in the Court of Queen's Bench, by either issuing a new claim or by way of enforcement proceedings of the claim upon which the agreement referenced above was made."
"The defendant obtained a tender to bank, blend and load coal at the plaintiff's coal preparation plant. In performing the contract, the defendant experienced equipment problems resulting in the plaintiff having to rent equipment from the defendant's predecessor. The plaintiff terminated the contract without any prior warning or notice to the defendant and brought an action for reimbursement of monies advanced under the contract and expenses incurred for the equipment rentals. The defendant counter-claimed for damages arising out of the termination of the contract, for services performed under the contract and for extras which had not been paid. Plaintiff entitled to reimbursement for overpayments and equipment rentals; defendant entitled to fair and reasonable compensation for extras for which court awarded the sum of $10,000. Both parties were in breach of the contract, the plaintiff's breach occurring because the volumes of coal supplied did not approximate the tonnages represented in the contractual documents. The clause excluding liability for errors in the forecast did not excuse the plaintiff because the actual volumes were not even approximate to the forecasted tonnages and the rates bid by the defendant were directly related to the anticipated tonnages. Absent evidence as to how the plaintiff arrived at the information used in the calculation of the forecasted tonnages, no negligent misrepresentation could be found, as there was no evidence that the information was negligently obtained. In respect to claims where on the evidence there was a loss, but it was difficult, if not impossible to quantify, damages were awarded even where it could be said the amount is a matter of guesswork.","The plaintiff/defendant sought reimbursement of monies advanced to the defendant by counterclaim and expenses it incurred for equipment rentals and other activities it claimed were required because of the failure of the defendant to perform under the contract. The defendant, under its contract, was required to maintain and service the banks, ditches, railway tracks and roadways for the purpose of banking, blending and lifting coal. The contractual obligation to maintain the banks was to be construed by the wording in the contract, and any variation in wording between the original invitation for tenders and the 1985 invitation for tender was inconsequential. The plaintiff was awarded the contract and commenced operations in late July 1985 and continued until terminated without prior notice by the defendant on March 11, 1986. The contract was cancelled by either party following written notice thirty-30 days in advance of such intention or by mutual agreement by both parties."
"The Crown appealed a conditional sentence of 2 years less a day imposed after the respondent pled guilty to three break and enters of dwelling houses and theft and possession of stolen property in February and March as well as two breaches of undertakings in March and June 2000. HELD: The conditional provision was removed as time spent on electronic monitoring and post sentence efforts were considered. A conditional sentence was not available in the circumstances. The 38 year old had 49 prior convictions. The sentencing judge noted the accused's 3.5 years of sobriety, community support, education and technical trade training, and positive pre-sentence report but failed to consider the gravity of the offences, the need for deterrence, and above all, protection of the public. The respondent had no sooner finished parole than he began to commit these crimes.","The Crown appealed a conditional sentence of two years less a day imposed on the respondent after he pled guilty to the following charges: breaking and entering a dwelling house and breaking into a jewellery store; breaking into another house and stealing property. The sentencing judge noted the respondent's alcohol problem, his three and one-half years of sobriety and that the respondent did so well on probation he was released early at his own request in December of 1999. She considered a positive pre-sentence report and the fact the respondent spent time on remand. HELD: Appeal allowed. 1)When one reviews the record it is easy to understand the position taken by the Crown which is for a penitentiary sentence. 2)When the sentencing judge reviewed the record she was of the view that there was a danger to the public that the offender was in a position to commit these offences. 3)The offender was 38 years old with 49 prior convictions."
"The Crown sought leave to appeal a conditional sentence of 9 months of time served plus 2 years less 1 day, including 3 months on electronic monitoring, and 2 years probation with a 10 year firearm prohibition on each charge to be served concurrently. The sentence was imposed for robbery with threats of violence contrary to s.348(1)(b) and s.334(2) of the Criminal Code which were committed in March 2000 while the accused was on probation. The appellant and co-accused were convicted of breaking and entering a private residence. The accused took $25 from the premises and held the 68 year old victim while the co-accused went to look for a knife after threatening to cut off his fingers. The following day the two accused used threats of violence while robbing a pharmacy and a witness testified the accused yelled to the co-accused to kill the victims. The co-accused who was convicted of assault received 7 years in prison for the robbery concurrent with 5 years for the B &amp; E. The 23 year old aboriginal who had a Grade 3 education had a prior record of 42 criminal convictions including eight violent or weapons related offences. HELD: Leave was granted. The appeal was allowed. The sentence of 4 years in prison on each charge to be served concurrently took into account time served on remand and electronic monitoring. The sentence was demonstrably unfit and fell outside the range of sentences previously imposed. The sentencing judge relied solely on the principle of rehabilitation, essentially ignoring the other sentencing principles including the level of gravity, the principle of deterrence, the need to denounce such acts, the sentence imposed on the co-accused, and the need to protect the public. A sentencing circle was inappropriate given the level of violence, his risk to re-offend, his consistent ignoring or refusal to follow court orders, and the fact that a penitentiary term was called for in such circumstances. He had violated various forms of community release orders including bail and probation 16 times. He had a history of drug and alcohol abuse and had not attended treatment.","The Crown sought leave to appeal the sentence imposed on the respondent after a sentencing circle. HELD: The Crown appeal was allowed. The sentencing circle was inappropriate in these circumstances given the level of violence, the respondent's high risk to reoffend, his consistent ignoring of or refusing to follow court orders and the fact a penitentiary term was called for. The Crown argued that the sentencing circle should reflect the gravity of the offence, not the severity of it. Allowing the appeal, setting aside the sentence and imposing a sentence of four years imprisonment from this date on each charge to be served concurrently, that the offender had a record of 42 criminal convictions including eight violent or weapons related offences and had violated various forms of community release orders including bail and probation orders some 16 times.. He had a grade 3 education and did not have significant employment history. In his pre-sentence report he was considered high risk for reoffending."
"This was an application for an order extending the time to apply for leave to appeal and for leave to appeal. Sections 13 and 14 of the Companies' Creditors Arrangement Act govern the appeal. The applicant took no steps to appeal within the 21 day period due to an inadvertence of its lawyer. HELD: The appeal was dismissed. The plain and ordinary meaning of the words of s. 14(2) of the Act is that only the court appealed from has power to extend the time within which leave must be sought. Section 14(2) of the Act prevails over s. 9(6) of The Court of Appeal Act, 2000.",This is an application for an order extending the time to apply for leave to appeal and for leave on appeal. The applicant took no steps to appeal within the twenty-one day period due to an inadvertence of its lawyer. The court has the power to extend the time either under s. 13 and 14 of the Companies Creditors Arrangement Act which empowers the appeal court to grant leave or for leave in appeal. HELD: The application was dismissed.  1)The applicant cannot bring itself within s. 14(2) of the Act. The Court of Appeal Act and its provisions relating to the protection of the applicant's intellectual property and the preservation of his or her intellectual property must be considered. 2)The Court of Queen's Bench has the right to make its own decisions.
"The accused applies for relief pursuant to the Charter on the basis of post-charge delay denying her the right to have her trial in a reasonable time. HELD: There was a Charter breach and the appropriate remedy is a stay of proceedings.  1) The length of delay in this case from the date of charge to the date of trial is approximately 31 months. The Supreme Court proposed as a general guideline a delay of 8 to 10 months in Provincial Court as acceptable. This is consistent with the reality in Buffalo Narrows, where trials are set within 6 months of entering a plea. 2) 12 months of the delay can be attributed to the accused. 6 months was deducted from the delay for inherent time requirements in arranging for the accused's appearance in Court. The remaining delay of 13 months is either attributable to the Crown or caused by factors outside the control of the accused. 3) In this case the accused has suffered actual prejudice in that the delay in bringing this matter to Court from the time of swearing the Information to the date of trial has prejudiced the accused's ability to make full answer and defence and her right to a fair trial. While the restrictions on employment opportunities caused some prejudice, this could have been overcome by applications to amend her conditions of release. 4) There have been four trial dates set on these charges, resulting in a lengthy delay to a verdict being reached. No explanation is offered for the adjournments except for the last adjournment caused by bad weather.","The accused applied for relief pursuant to the Charter of Rights on the basis of post-charge delay denying her the right to have her trial in a reasonable time. There had been four trial dates set on these charges, resulting in a lengthy delay to a verdict being reached on the charges. HELD: There was a Charter breach and the appropriate remedy was a stay of proceedings.  1)There was a breach of the accused's Charter right to apply for relief. 2)There were no waiver of the delay. 3)The court found the prejudice to the accused outweighs the public interest in having her tried for the charge. The court found that there was a heightened public interest, as there is in offences of this nature, in having trials set within six months of entering plea. The Court found the accused could have applied to amend her conditions of release to alleviate some of the stress and frustration she was experiencing."
"The parties' hostility prevented them from reaching an agreement on interim parenting arrangements for their two-and-a-half-year-old child. There was a no contact order in place pending the outcome of domestic violence charges against the father (who had not seen the child for four months). The mother had nothing positive to say about him. They disagreed about the extent of his marijuana use, and the extent of his involvement with the child. He agreed to abstain from drugs around the child and for 12 hours before access. The mother expressed concern the father was a flight risk because he was from Egypt and had family support outside the country. Sole custody to the mother, with supervised access for a period of time (to reintroduce the father to the child), moving to increasingly longer periods of daytime access. The father must complete a parenting course to better learn how to meet the child's various needs. There was insufficient evidence to show he is unable to protect the child from her severe nut allergy. There was insufficient evidence to establish he is a flight risk. Even if he had threatened to flee with the child, it is relevant that he lacks the means to do so. While there has been unpleasantness and some violence between the parties, the evidence does not establish domestic violence of a nature that would require supervised access on an ongoing basis.","The mother sought to have the father supervised. The father had not had contact with the child since January 2010. Given her age the parties agreed there would need to be a gradual reintroduction between the father and child and that this should be managed by utilizing the services provided by Veith House. HELD: Joint custody was granted. The court could not categorize the violence that occurred between the parties during the incident in question, nor the other unpleasant events that occurred in their relationship, as domestic violence requiring the father's access to be supervised."
"This decision is supplementary to [1993]TWL QB93506. Applications to further divide matrimonial property and to vary spousal maintenance. The husband had declared personal bankruptcy since the date of the original orders obtained under the Matrimonial Property Act and Divorce Act. HELD: 1)The husband's obligation to pay maintenance was reduced to $1 per month and the arrears accruing after the date of his assignment into bankruptcy were cancelled.  2)The wife's counsel requested that the court value and divide all of the matrimonial property equally notwithstanding the bankruptcy, because she might pursue a constructive trust claim for her 1/2 share as against the husband's trustee. 3)The court valued all of the matrimonial property and determined that 56% of this value should be paid to the wife, and only 44% to the husband, given amounts he had spent since the separation.  4)The court left unresolved the issue of which matrimonial assets might be exempt under the Bankruptcy Act and therefore available to the wife.","In November 1993 following a trial involving the divorce of the parties, including corollary relief on such questions as spousal maintenance and the division of matrimonial property, the Court granted the respondent wife 56% of the estimated asset value and the respondent husband 44%. The wife sought a variation of the previous maintenance order in November in light of his bankrupt financial situation and his inability to earn any income at this time. HELD: 1)Division of property divided based on the respondent's evidence that he did not take up farming and his subsequent decision to assign himself into bankruptcy made the calculation of what each party could hope to recover from the marriage assets problematic at best. 2)The respondent's claim for set-off should be allowed. The wife was entitled to a share of the $1,100.00 payment which came due in November. 3)The petitioner did not pursue. livestock operation on the farm for a number of reasons, one of which being the fact that he required surgery on his back. making it impossible for him to physically do the work. 4)A hearing date was set for May 13 at which the respondent was asked in accordance with the prior judgment to complete the division. 5)The wife's motion for a variation sought by the respondent to include all of the remaining farm lands, remaining farm machinery and grain on. hand would normally go to satisfy the unsecured creditors of the respondent under his bankruptcy. 6)The court concluded based mostly on the petitioner's evidence, that while this was a matrimonious asset, it was also a valuable farm operation which he could arrange to carry on a livestock operation and revive the farm income. 7)The Court concluded that the petitioner wasted the matrimony asset to the detriment of the wife. The Court declined to allow this aspect of her. claim. 8)Reimbursement of legal fees In my opinion the respondent should be granted the same privilege."
"This is an application for leave to appeal, and leave being granted, an appeal by the Crown from a sentence imposed against a young offender pursuant to the Youth Criminal Justice Act. The respondent pled guilty to a charge of robbery, an offence contrary to s. 344(b) of the Criminal Code. The respondent was sentenced to 90 days secure custody, 45 days community supervision, 1 year probation and a 10 year firearms prohibition. HELD: Appeal allowed orally. The sentence is set aside and a sentence of 12 months closed custody, 6 months community supervision, 1 year probation and a 10 year firearms prohibition was imposed in addition to the 90 days closed custody already served at the time of the appeal.  1) It was clear that the primary concern of the sentencing judge was that, in the wake of the Supreme Court of Canada decision in R. v. B.W.P.; R. v. B.V.N. 2006 SCC 27, a custodial sentence might not be open to him at all. It is the Court's view that the sentencing judge's conclusion that the decision in B.W.P. virtually ruled out custodial sentences for young persons under the Youth Criminal Justice Act was unwarranted. The gist of that decision is that under the Act the principle of general deterrence is not a factor to be taken into account and cannot be used to justify a sentence harsher than the circumstances of the offender and the offence would warrant. Nor is specific deterrence to be considered as a separate factor. 2) It is the Court's view that a long custodial sentence is necessary to accomplish the task of bringing the seriousness of the offence to the respondent's attention, and provide meaningful consequences to reinforce societal values without negatively affecting the respondent's likelihood of rehabilitation.","This was an application for leave to appeal and, leave being granted, an appeal by the Crown from a sentence imposed against a young offender pursuant to the Youth Criminal Justice Act. The sentence was set aside and a sentence of 12 months closed custody, 6 months community supervision, 1 year probation and a 10 year firearms prohibition was imposed in addition to the 90 days closed custody already served at the time of the appeal. HELD: Appeal allowed orally. 1) The sentence imposed was demonstrably unfit, failing to take into account the seriousness of the offence, the culpability of the offender, the criminal history and other circumstances of the respondent, and the principles of sentencing set out in the Act.  2) The sentencing judge focused considerable attention on the decision of the Supreme Court of Canada in B.W.P., which he took to mean that the principle of general deterrence was not a factor to be taken into account and cannot be used to justify a sentence harsher than the circumstances and the respondent's offence would warrant. Nor is specific deterrence to be considered as a separate factor."
"The parties entered into a handwritten agreement with regard to the feeding and maintenance of 100 cows. The plaintiff was to provide labour and the necessary equipment to feed and maintain the cows for $.50 per cow per day. The defendant was to provide the feed and medicine. At paragraph 6 the contract stipulated that the plaintiff was to receive a bonus for each live calf that he got to pasture. The amount of the bonus was left blank. The plaintiff sues the defendant, claiming a bonus for the 2004-2005 year and the 2005-2006 year. HELD: The claim is dismissed. In law an agreement to come to an agreement is not enforceable. This is especially true where an essential term regarding remuneration has not been agreed to. The parties agreed that they would settle on the bonus amount later on but they never did. The plaintiff believes he is still entitled to a bonus. The Court cannot make the agreement for the parties.",The parties signed a handwritten agreement on the 20th day of October 2004. The contract was to cover feeding and maintenance of one hundred and one cows to be boarded at the plaintiff's farm. The plaintiff was to provide labor and equipment necessary to feed and maintain the cows and a bonus of $ was to be paid to the plaintiff for each live calf that he gets to pasture. HELD: The action was dismissed. 1)The plaintiff did not contemplate payment of a bonus because the cows had been more carefully bread and calving was expected to occur and did occur in the more mild temperatures of April and May. 2)The court found that the contract was not enforceable and dismissed the action.
"FIAT: The plaintiff seeks an order confirming the order nisi for judicial sale. HELD: Application dismissed. The Court will not set aside the order nisi for judicial sale on the basis that the application for leave was premature or that the statement of claim was not noted for default. However, the application for confirmation of the sale is premature as the property is to be listed for 6 months. There does not appear on the evidence to be a sale to be confirmed. The plaintiff is prepared to make an offer, but does not appear to have done so. The draft bill of costs submitted contains numerous items which occurred prior to the granting of leave and there is no order from the Court authorizing pre-leave costs, nor any evidence as to why the Court might consider pre-leave costs. On a renewed application for confirmation of judicial sale, it would be preferable to have evidence directly from the listing agent setting out the steps taken to market the property and detailing for the Court any offers received. There will be no costs awarded for this unsuccessful application.","FIAT: The plaintiff seeks an order confirming the order nisi for judicial sale.

"The accused plead guilty to two counts of sexual assault. The victims were his granddaughters. The assaults were alleged to have occurred between 1983 and 1991. A sentencing hearing was held because there was significant disagreement on the facts. The Crown alleged three aggravating factors: 1) that the sexual assaults were numerous, 2) that the accused touched the victims directly on their skin and not just on their clothing and 3) that there was digital penetration by the accused on both victims. HELD: At a sentencing hearing, the Crown must prove aggravating factors beyond a reasonable doubt. The Court held that the two victims were sexually assaulted by the accused on numerous occasions over a period of a number of years. The Court was satisfied these sexual assaults were a common occurrence on every occasion that the accused was in the company of his granddaughters. The Court found that the accused touched the victims under their clothing on numerous occasions and that there were a couple of occasions that the accused digitally penetrated each victim. Finally, the Court concluded that the accused got bolder over time and took more liberties and chances with his victims.",The accused was charged with two counts of sexual assault contrary to s. 724(3)(e) of the Criminal Code. HELD: The accused was found guilty of both counts. The evidence of the victims was sufficiently credible to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that there was digital penetration. The accused got bolder as time passed and took more liberties and chances to get more. The Court concluded that the accused was the abuser and consciously or unconsciously touched the victims under their clothing on many occasions. These sexual assaults were a common occurrence on every occasion. The Crown sought a sentencing hearing pursuant to s724(4)(e). The accused agreed to testify.
"A large diseased elm tree fell on a truck and injured the plaintiff driver. For some years prior to the accident, the defendant had operated a hazardous tree removal program. An inspector had examined the tree that fell. The inspector had no expertise relating to trees or their diseases, nor did his immediate superior. For the plaintiff, that there is a prima fade duty of care owed by the Department of Transportation to users of highway against reasonably foreseeable hazards, including the falling of trees onto the highway. Further, the defendant had a duty to use a reasonable standard of care in the operation of the hazardous tree removal program. The defendant was negligent in failing to train the inspector properly. The Court referred at length to the Supreme Court of Canada decision in Just v. British Columbia. The defendant's claim against the third parties (owners/occupiers of property on which tree stood) was dismissed.","The plaintiff was killed when a tree fell on his truck, crushing him inside the cab. He was now a paraplegic. The plaintiff's action was originally framed in nuisance and negligence but was discontinued when the Attorney General refused to discontinue the action against the defendants. Dismissing the action, that in order to establish that a duty of care arises in a particular situation, it is necessary to bring the facts of that situation within those of previous situations in which the duty has been held to exist.. The plaintiff was in good health and driving his half ton truck on a public highway near Falmouth, Nova Scotia.. The defendant had hired an expert to examine the plaintiff's tree and found that the tree had not fallen due to DED but from Ganoderma applanatum, a fungus which is common on stumps but rare on the area of wound parasite.. An expert should then examine the wound."
"The plaintiffs original application was supported by her solicitor's affidavit. The Defence wanted the solicitor removed. The solicitor agreed to withdraw from the original application but wanted to appear on the Defence's interlocutory application to strike. Ordering the solicitor not to continue in the original or any related applications, that a lawyer has a duty not to give evidence in a matter in which he or she is involved as counsel except in merely formal or uncontroverted matters. Here the applications were so closely related that where it was improper to act in one, it was improper to act in the other.","The applicant solicitor applied to strike the defendant's application to remove him as solicitor for the plaintiff, alleging negligence. Application granted; defendant to amend plaintiff's originating notice to allege negligence; intervenor to cross-examine solicitor who had submitted affidavit supporting motion to strike. Application dismissed; solicitor to continue as solicitor in the employ of the defendant solicitor in Nova Scotia; application to strike granted; the applicant solicitor's amendment granted so that he is entitled to amend the plaintiff's original application to claim negligence. Intervenor granted; costs awarded to the defendant in the amount of $650 and costs to the intervenor as requested; the plaintiff was to remain on the stand as both witness and counsel."
"An application was brought under ss.58 and 59 of The Bankruptcy and Insolvency Act seeking approval for a proposal made by Gustafson Pontiac Buick. The proposal had received the necessary proportion of support from Gustafson's creditors. One unsecured creditor opposed the application. HELD: 1)Under s. 59(2), before it can approve a proposal, the Court must be satisfied; (a) that the terms are reasonable; (b) that the terms are calculated to benefit the general body of creditors; and (c) that the proposal is made in good faith. 2)In determining whether to approve a proposal, the court must consider not only the wishes and interests of creditors, but also the conduct and interests of the debtor, the interests of the public and future creditors and the requirements of commercial morality. 3)If, however, a large majority of creditors, i.e., substantially in excess of the statutory majority, have voted for acceptance of a proposal, it will take strong reasons for the court to substitute its judgment for that of the creditors. 4)Gustafson had met the criteria set out in the Act and the authorities referred to in Bankruptcy and Insolvency Law of Canada, and accordingly the proposal was approved.","This was an application pursuant to ss. 58 and 59 of the Bankruptcy and Insolvency Act for the approval of a proposal made pursuant to s. 50 of the Act by Gustafson Pontiac Buick Cadillac GMC Ltd. (Gustafson). At the meeting of the unsecured creditors to approve the proposal, six members of the class of creditors voted against the approval representing approximately $430,000 of the indebtedness of the corporation. The proposal was primarily calculated to benefit Prairie Security Fund and the guarantors of the secured creditors of. the corporation and not the general body of creditors. Only Oak Bluff appeared in opposition to the application for Court approval. The grounds for opposing the application were set out in Houlden and Morawetz. Law of Canada, 3rd ed. (1993) Vol. 1, p. 2-144.8 Generally, the court must be satisfied that the terms of the proposal are reasonable or are not calculated to. benefit the creditors. equally. If, however, a large majority of creditors, i.e.,. substantially in excess of the statutory majority, have voted for acceptance of proposal, it will take strong reasons for the court to substitute its judgment for that of the creditor."
"The accuseds were charged under ss.300 and 301 of the Code with (i)committing and (ii)publishing a defamatory libel against a police officer. They filed a plea of justification as permitted under s.611(1) of the Code. The Crown denied the truth of the plea pursuant to s.611(4) and the matter proceeded to trial. At the opening of their trial the accuseds applied for an order declaring ss.300 and 301 of the Criminal Code to be of no force and effect on the basis that they constituted an unreasonable limitation on their rights and freedoms guaranteed under ss.2, 7 and 11 of the Charter. The Crown admitted that ss.300 and 301 limited an individual's right to freedom of expression as provided by s.2 of the Charter but argued that this infringement was justified under s.1 of the Charter. HELD: Application allowed in part.  1)The onus of justifying the limitation of a right or freedom is on the party seeking to uphold the limitation and the standard of proof is by a preponderance of probability. 2)The standards against which a limit on a right or freedom guaranteed by the Charter can be shown to be reasonable and demonstrably justified are those underlying values and principles essential to a free and democratic society. While the right of free speech is important in our society, it is not unrestricted. 3)In order to justify an infringement of this right, it must be shown that: (i)the impugned legislative provision has an objective of pressing and substantial concern and (ii)there is a proportionality to the legislation in that: (a)the measures must be fair and not arbitrary, carefully designed to achieve the objective in question and rationally connected to the objective; (b)the means should impair freedom of expression as little as possible; (c)there must be a proportionality between the effects of the limiting legislation and the objective. S.300 of the Code meets these tests, and is therefore a reasonable limit on free speech and is valid. 4)Ss.611 and 612 of the Code, which permit a plea of justification do not create a reverse onus on the accused. They are procedural and merely serve to put the Crown on notice as to the accused's defence. The Crown must still prove that the alleged defamatory libel is knowingly false beyond a reasonable doubt. 5)S.301 of the Code makes it an offence to publish a defamatory libel whether or not the accused believes it to be true. S.301 is therefore not a reasonable limit and is invalid. ADDENDUM: The Court ordered that the agreed statement of facts set out at pp. 2 and 3 of the judgment not be published nor broadcast in any manner.","The applicants apply for relief pursuant to s. 300 and 301 of the Criminal Code. HELD: The application for relief is granted. 1)The accused are found guilty of defamatory libel. 2)S. 300 of the Code constitutes a reasonable limit prescribed by law as can be demonstrably justified in a free and democratic society. 3)The Court must consider all expression that is potentially restricted by s.300 of the code, not only the expressions involved in this particular case. 4)The court must not be diverted by the offensive content of the particular speech giving rise to the Charter challenge. 5)The offence of defamation is a serious one and the limitation imposed on freedom of expression is negligible. 6)Defamation is a form of defamation which can be justified under s.2(b) of the Charter. The Court must be guided by the values and principles essential to a free, democratic society such that respect for the inherent dignity and worth of the human person is a significant facet. The principles underlying the principles of free, open, respectful society are at issue."
"Guardian was the general liability insurer for Kellogg. Royal was the primary insurer as holder of Kellogg's blanket fleet coverage. Kellogg's employee was involved in a motor vehicle accident while on company business but was driving his wife's vehicle at the time of the accident. Royal denied coverage and refused to defend on the basis of an exclusionary provision regarding the use of substitute automobiles. It was held at trial that Royal was not obligated to participate. HELD: 1)The case law reveals some inconsistencies with respect to the relationship between the duty to defend and the coverage provided by the policy. Where the policy clearly does not provide coverage, the insurer had no duty to defend. Where a policy only provides coverage for some allegations the insurer is only obligated to defend those allegations which may trigger the obligation to indemnify. When a policy is ambiguous some courts have adopted Thames and have stated the mere possibility that the policy may provide coverage is sufficient to oblige the insurer to defend. 2)Section 209 provides no guidelines as to the scope of the inquiry the judge may engage in. The chamber judge did not define the scope of his inquiry and stated that the standard suggestion that Guardian must raise an arguable point was 'off target'. To determine whether an insurer has the obligation to defend a chamber judge must examine the coverage provided by the policy. The judge made no finding of ambiguity in the exclusionary provision. He simply determined the Honda was not covered by the Royal policy and did not decide the issue of indemnity. 3)The affidavit evidence indicated that the parties lived in the same premises thus that argument was without merit. CONCURRING JUDGMENT: The appeal was dismissed for different reasons.  1)There has been an acceptance of the general concept that the duty to defend is broader than the duty to indemnify. To order an insurer to defend a chamber judge need be less sure the policy provides coverage than would be the case for an actual determination of liability under the policy. 2)There was a factual element which could not be determined on this application such as whether a partially deflated tire constitutes a breakdown within the meaning of the policy and whether the automobile the employee was driving was owned by someone living in the same dwelling. 3)The question centered around the words used in clause 5 of the policy and who it referred to. There were inconsistencies in terminology. The policy should not be interpreted as though the restriction it contains on what automobile can be used as a temporary substitute should be ignored.","This appeal arises from an application for directions pursuant to s. 209 of the Saskatchewan Insurance Act. The appellant, Guardian Insurance, is the general liability insurer of the respondent Kellogg Canada Inc. (Kellogg). The respondent agreed it had an obligation to defend but submitted that Royal also had a duty to defend in the name and on behalf of the insured. The chambers judge found that Royal was not obligated to defend because the Honda involved was not insured by Royal. The issue to be resolved on appeal is whether the chambers judge erred in his application of the principles of contract interpretation when he decided the Honda was not a 'temporary substitute automobile' within the terms of the Royal policy. HELD: 1)The chambers judge did not have the factual basis before him to support his interpretation of the policy and form his conclusions. 2)The issue of indemnity arises only when the pleadings disclose a claim which, if proven at trial, would be covered by provisions in the insurance policy. When the allegations do not come within the policy coverage, the insurer has no obligation. 3)The Court was in a good position as any court will ever be to interpret the meaning of 'insured' in clause 5(c) of the Act."
"The applicant applies for amendment of the judgment dated March 19, 1999 as it relates to costs. At the end of trial, the applicant requested the Court to reserve on the matter of costs. The applicant intended to make a submission for award of solicitor and clients costs. Evidence was led at trial about insubstantial offers made directly between the parties. Further evidence now indicates that substantial offers were made through council although not led at trial. The applicant argues that solicitor and client costs of $70,000 should be awarded because the offer to settle of $250,000 is close to the total judgment award of $230,000 including party and party costs of $20,000. The respondent takes the position that the estate was willing to pay reasonable maintenance costs and the quantum of maintenance could have been summarily determined without the necessity of extensive discoveries and without a lengthy trial. The respondent submits the approach of a needs-based assessment was upheld by the judgment and is always the approach always taken on behalf of the estate. The respondent argues the real question is whether the parties were acting bona fide during their negotiations and the issue should not be determined on the basis of the closeness of the offers. HELD: Solicitor and Client Costs of $70,000 are not appropriate in this case. The applicant's conduct was not entirely pure. The applicant was made aware in a prior judgment that under The Dependants' Relief Act there is nothing to indicate that a person is entitled to part of an estate as a beneficiary but rather that a beneficiary is entitled to maintenance. In spite of this ruling the applicant continued to claim the whole of the estate and to pursue full disclosure of the financial worth of the estate. Solicitor and client costs are within the discretion of the court but such discretion is exercise only in rare and exceptional circumstances. The conduct of the respondent cannot be characterized as reprehensible, scandalous or outrageous. The respondent's unwillingness to make full financial disclosure did contribute to the increase of costs but is insufficient to merit full solicitor and client costs. The Court awards fixed costs to the applicant in the amount of $47,000 together with disbursements.","The applicant applies for an amendment of the judgment of March 19, 1999 insofar as it relates to costs. At the conclusion of trial, counsel requested that reserve on the matter of costs. It is now clear that the applicant intended to make a submission for award of solicitor and client costs of approximately $70,000. Evidence was led at trial about insubstantial offers made directly between the parties. The evidence now shows that substantial offers were made through counsel. The applicant argued that the position taken before the Court was always to claim that the entire estate should be transferred to satisfy Jade's maintenance. The respondent argued that it needed to know the full extent of the estate so as to properly determine the applicant's entitlement to the estate. HELD: 1) The judgment in that particular requires an amendment since there was no evidence before the court at trial that substantive offers made by counsel for the parties were made prior to trial and not from the time of entering the judgment until the judgment is satisfied.  2) The Court was satisfied that the issue of costs should be re-examined. It was appropriate to fix the costs to the applicant in lump sum.  3) The applicant was asked to consider the respondent's position that under the Dependants' Relief Act, 1996, there is nothing that indicates that a person entitled to part of an estate is a beneficiary but rather that a beneficiary may be found entitled to'maintenance'. The evidence at trial was led by counsel who was not before Court at trial.  4) It is not an appropriate case in which to order full solicitor/client costs in order to avoid taxation.  5) The court has an inherent power to vary its own order so that to carry out what was intended or even to reconsider or withdraw the decision so long as the order has not been perfected."
"The accused, Cote, applied for remedy pursuant to s.24 of the Charter of Rights stating that he was denied the right to be tried on a fraud charge within a reasonable time. Twenty-two months passed between the laying of the charge and the trial date. Cote was not responsible for the delay and actively pursued a speedy trial. The delay was caused by the Crown's failure to provide timely disclosure. HELD: The charge was stayed. In applying the decision of the SCC in R. v. Morin, the court found that 22 months is an unreasonable and exceptional period of delay and is of sufficient length to warrant an inquiry. This case had no particular complexity above the norm for cases of this kind and did not require this delay. Cote did not directly or indirectly waive his s.11(b) right to be tried within a reasonable time. Cote was subject to substantial and sufficient prejudice by the delay. He suffered damage to his political career, embarrassment from media reports, unemployment, and economic hardship. The court balanced the individual's right to be tried within a reasonable time with society's interest in having the matter proceed to trial despite delay. Here the defence was not seeking to delay the trial and use the protective shield of s.11(b)as an offensive weapon.","The accused was committed to stand trial on one of the fraud charges. He now applies to this court for a remedy pursuant to s. 24 of the Charter of Rights and Freedoms. The application is based primarily on the accused's position that he has been denied the right to be tried on the fraud charge within a reasonable time. HELD: 1)The Court found that the accused had suffered an unnecessary additional 9 months of unemployment, economic hardship and other prejudice in the form of embarrassment from the numerous media reports of the charges. 2)The prejudice to the accused has been substantial and sufficient to tilt the balance in favour of requiring a judicial stay. 3)The length of delay in proceeding with the preliminary hearing falls to the Crown as does the one-month delay from the first appearance on May 12 to the third appearance on June when sufficient disclosure had been made to allow the accused to make an informed election. The total delay amounts to 9 months. 4)The balancing of competing interests is difficult, but in this case, the prejudice is substantial. It does not excuse them from the delay that was the result of its tardiness."
"The parties were married for 13 years and had three children. Both parties appeared to have a standard of living higher than their personal annual income would dictate; the husband by funneling many of his personal expenses through his company and the wife with the financial assistance of her parents. The wife sought lump sum spousal support to cover the cost of her tuition for a three year course in a divinity college. In addition to the matrimonial home, the parties owned various rental properties. Joint custody of the children ordered with primary day to day care to be with the wife; in the event that the parties cannot agree on any major issue concerning the children, the final decision will be made by the wife; income attributed to the husband for child support purposes; piano lessons and musical instruments found to be extraordinary expenses within the meaning of s. 7 of the Guidelines but soccer, tennis and horseback riding are not; no spousal support ordered; all property equally divided. The wife's father had given her one rental property from which the rental proceeds went to the mortgage and into the parties' joint bank account; the husband was extensively involved in the operation of the property. This property was found to be a gift to the wife that became a matrimonial asset during the marriage as it was operated as a family venture. A second rental property was purchased by the husband and the wife's brother; the wife considered herself a partner in the venture even though her name was left off the deed. This property was also found to be a matrimonial asset.","The parties agreed to share joint custody of the three children of a numbered company solely owned by the father. The father was opposed to the payment of spousal support in any form, arguing that it involves every second weekend. The mother argued that the father was not committed to maintaining the children's relationship with their father, and that he should pay basic guideline support for the children in the amount of $650 monthly. The parties also agreed that primary care would remain with the mother. HELD: Custody: The parties agreed that a Joint Custody Order was to be issued and primary care shall remain with her. There was no basis for an unequal division as listed in s. 18 of the Matrimonial Property Act; the father had been extensively involved in the operation of the property since it was purchased and that the couple considered this property to be a joint business operated for the benefit of the family; the mother was prepared to consult but wants the final say when they cannot agree; meaningful consultation is unlikely in the foreseeable future."
"The accused was charged with driving a motor vehicle while his licence was revoked when he was found operating an all terrain vehicle (ATV) on a highway. Accused found not guilty; the accused could not have obtained a licence to drive an ATV on the highway because it is a prohibited vehicle. Before one can be found guilty of this offence, it must be proven that they were driving a motor vehicle of a type or class for which they could have been properly licenced to drive on a highway.","The accused was observed by police officers driving his all terrain vehicle (ATV) along a highway. His driver's license was revoked and he was charged with driving a prohibited vehicle on the highway under s. 11, but the only issue at trial was whether this made the accused guilty of the offence of driving a motor vehicle on a highway while his licence was revoked contrary to s.287(2) of the Motor Vehicle Act. HELD: The accused was found not guilty. The words'motor vehicle' and 'ATV' in the Act do not include an ATV and that even if those words did, the accused should be found guilty because his license revocation is irrelevant since he could never have been licensed to drive an electric vehicle. It was vehicle of the wrong type or class to get license. The accused's conduct was lawful. The only issue is whether this makes him guilty of driving the motor vehicle while his license is revoked and his 'driver's license' was revoked. The offence was committed while the accused was driving the ATV."
"The tenants appealed a decision of a hearing officer under s. 72 of The Residential Tenancies Act. The hearing officer determined that the landlord's claim for non-payment of rent had been established and that an order for possession as warranted. The hearing officer directed that the order of possession would be deferred if the tenant paid the rent that was owing and future rent. The tenants argued that the hearing officer erred in not considering that the premises were infested with bed bugs and the tenants had been forced to incur personal expense to remedy the problem. They sought to adduce new evidence by affidavit on this point at the appeal. HELD: The Court declined to admit the affidavit evidence about bed bugs. However, the matter was remitted to the hearing officer for rehearing because the reasons provided by the hearing officer were deficient. The Court held that it was impossible to tell whether the hearing officer considered the tenants' evidence at the hearing, made findings of fact in that regard or whether equitable jurisdiction should be invoked in this situation. The reasons are inadequate to allow a meaningful review of the decision.","The tenants appeal the decision of a hearing officer under s. 72 of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006. They contend the hearing officer, who rendered her decision on May 31, 2012, committed several errors of law and seek to have the matter remitted back for re-hearing. HELD: The appeal is allowed. The matter is remitted to the Hearing Officer for rehearing pursuant to s. 70(11)(c) of the Act. The Court finds the reasons inadequate to allow for meaningful review of the decision and for this reason the matter must be remitted forward to the Court of Appeal."
"SGI applied on behalf of the defendant for an order under Queen's Bench Rule 107A(c) and s. 7 of The Contributory Negligence Act for leave to add the City of Saskatoon as a third party to the action. The defendant is being sued by the plaintiff for damage caused to a construction site under a bridge in Saskatoon. The damage is alleged to have been caused when the defendant's truck left the ramp leading onto the bridge and fell into an excavation pit. The defendant argues that the City should be added as a third party because the City did not take proper steps to clear snow from the ramp, which provided a surface for his vehicle to launch off of. HELD: The application to add the City of Saskatoon as a third party was granted. The applicant has made out a prima facie case against the proposed third party. There is no prejudice to the plaintiff because he has settled with his insurer and is requesting settlement with the defendant's insurer. There is a causal connection between the cause of action plead in the statement of claim and the third party notice. It is immaterial at this stage that the City may have an absolute defence.","FIAT: This is an application by Saskatchewan Government Insurance on behalf of the defendant to an order pursuant to Queen's Bench Rules and s.7 of The Contributory Negligence Act granting leave to the defendant, William J. Schmidt, to add the City of Saskatoon as a third party to this action. The defendant is being sued by the plaintiff for damage to a construction site under the Senator Sid Buckwold Bridge caused as result of his truck leaving the surface of the road at the head of the bridge going over the guardrail and falling into the excavation pit. The plaintiff alleges that the road condition was icy on the exit ramp leading up to the bridge and the city had not taken steps to address the icy road surfaces. HELD: The application was granted as requested. 1) There is yet another ground on which the City is absolved from liability. The Supreme Court of Canada in Lewis recognized that it was entirely permissible for local authority to limit its liability. Section 154(1.1) of The Urban Municipality Act, 1984 states that a city is not liable for damage caused by the presence, absence or type of any wall, fence, guardrail, railing, curb, pavement markings, traffic control device or barrier. No action may be brought pursuant to subsection (1) for the recovery of damages.  2) The applicant has already commenced separate action against the city for damages resulting from the truck leaving its road. The applicant argues that adding the city as a party will allow all damages to be considered and where responsibility should lie for damages arising from the Truck leaving the road in one proceeding. The City opposes the application and argues that s.308 of The Cities Act, S.S. 2002, c. C-11.1, which reads: 308 city of ss.2.1 and ss.7, which states: Having reviewed the pleadings and pleadings, it would appear that the third party was a major player in undertaking the work which is the subject of the plaintiffs loss and claim.  3) The application is purely one of procedure and no substantive rights between the parties can be satisfied."
"HELD: The defendant was ordered to present argument on the return date on whether the circumstances warranted consideration as an “exceptional circumstance” pursuant to s. 37(2) of the Act, to determine whether the application should proceed.","FIAT. Default judgment at case management was granted in the within matter December 1, 2014 against the defendants, Mario Di Battista and R-Rock Concrete (2013). (R-Rock) in the amount of $19,393. HELD: The default judgment was set aside pursuant to s. 37(1) of the Small Claims Act, now in excess of 1 year from the granting of the judgment. The applicant sought to have the summons issue upon the respondent, Discovery Ford Sales Ltd... Given the inordinate amount of time that has elapsed from the grant of the default judgment, the Court directs that upon the return date argument is to be presented first as to whether the circumstances warrant consideration as an 'exceptional circumstance' permitting the application to proceed.. Second, whether on the merits, the judgment ought to be set aside."
"HELD: The issues were determined as follows: 1) the applicant applied pursuant to The Seizure of Criminal Property Act, 2009, as that version of the Act was in place at the time of the seizure. The respondent argued that s. 35.1 did not apply at the time of seizure, because it was not in the Act at the time of seizure. The respondent argued that the two-year limitation period pursuant to The Limitations Act applied to the application with the date of seizure being the date of discoverability. The respondent also argued that the 2009 Act did not have retrospective application. The court found that the applicant applied pursuant to the 2009 Act and therefore the matter was assessed from that perspective. Section 35.1 of the 2009 Act required applications for forfeiture to be made within two years from the director becoming satisfied that the property sought to be forfeited was proceeds of unlawful activity or an instrument of unlawful activity. The court found that the words “Notwithstanding The Limitations Act” at the beginning of s. 35.1 served to provide an intention to prioritize the content of s. 35.1 over The Limitations Act. An affidavit filed by the applicant indicated that the director became satisfied that the property was an instrument of unlawful activity after August 2016. The director’s application was brought four months later, well within the two-year limitation period. The court then considered whether the 2009 Act had retrospective application and found that B. had the same legal position and faced the same jeopardy regardless of the version of the legislation, and therefore, there was no retrospective problem;  2) s. 7 outlined the test to apply. The court accepted the expert’s evidence with regards to the significance of the factors evidencing drug trafficking and how common they were to the drug trafficking trade. The applicant’s evidence also showed that the person alleging to purchase the truck from the respondent was not the purchaser and the purchase price was $8,000, not $16,000. The court found it more likely than not that the money was proceeds of unlawful activity; and 3) B. did not provide evidence or argument to support the exception that forfeiture would clearly not be in the interests of justice. The property was found to be proceeds of unlawful activity and the forfeiture order was granted.","This is an application by the Director under the The Seizure of Criminal Property Act for an order directing the forfeiture of $10,475.00 to the Crown in Saskatchewan pursuant to Part II.1 of the 2009 Act. The property had been seized by the Regina Police Service (RPS) from William Ross Butler in 2008. Since the RPS filed notice of dispute in response to those proceedings, the Director applied to this Court for a forfeiture order pursuant to s.35.1. HELD: The application was brought four months later and fell comfortably within the two year limitation window prescribed by s. 35.1.. The Director filed the affidavits of the officers who were involved in the search of the property in support of the Director. The Director argued that the current legislative mandate reflected in s. 2009 Act is prospective in operational effect and not retroactive.. The evidence on when the Director 'became satisfied' the seized property constituted proceeds of unlawful activity is found in the Affidavit of Tammy Pryznyk sworn December 15, 2016.. In the circumstances, the Court accepted the Director's evidence as an expert qualified to express an opinion in the area of controlled drugs and substances seized before this legislation came into force.. The Limitations Act, SS 2004, L-16.1 bars commencement of proceedings two years after the date of discoverability. The reality is that the Director commenced proceedings under the 2009 act thus the Director’s authority to pursue a forfeiture application must be assessed from that perspective alone."
"HELD: The court sentenced the accused to a global sentence of 10 years for the manslaughter conviction. A one-year concurrent sentence was imposed for the conviction of prohibited possession of a firearm. The court gave him credit at the rate of 1:1.5 for his time on remand, resulting in a net global sentence of six years, five months to be served in a federal penitentiary. The Gladue report was considered and the background of the accused was assessed as an enormous mitigating factor. The court found that this was not an appropriate case to make an order pursuant to s. 743.6 of the Code both because of the multiple Gladue factors and because it had addressed the principles of denunciation and deterrence in the global sentence.","The accused was originally charged with second degree murder with regard to the death of his cousin. He pled guilty to possession of a firearm while prohibited from doing so. The Crown argued that a global sentence of 10 years was appropriate given the multiple Gladue factors relevant to the accused taken as a whole, including his extensive criminal record, his current violent record and his utterances about white men being rapists and pedophiles. HELD: The accused was sentenced to a concurrent sentence of 1 year to 12 years for the manslaughter conviction and 1 year concurrent sentence with no parole eligibility until Gordon had served half of that sentence pursuant to s. 743.6(1) of the Criminal Code. The court reviewed the various cases provided to it by counsel for the Crown and defence and found that the Crown must demonstrate a foundation for such additional rigour in the sentencing of the offender. Although the Crown provided the Court with multiple cases, the Court found that it should not be relied upon in support of a 15 year global sentence for the offence of manslaughter. Having considered all of the purposes and principles of sentencing as outlined in ss. 718, 718 and 718.2 of the Code including the totality principle and the Gladue factor, the court has determined that a total of 11 years is appropriate in this case to be served in a federal institution."
"The applicant sought a declaration that the province was responsible for providing school buildings for delivery of the public school program and that when buildings must be leased, the province bore the associated costs. The applicant, which leased six school buildings from the Roman Catholic Church, submitted the respondent was required to reimburse the applicant for leasing costs. For the respondent, that the Education Act requires a request be made of the Minister in proper form and receive Governor in Council approval. Because the applicant failed to report to the Minister, the respondent was not required to pay the leasing costs. Where the Minister received a request in the proper form and where it was determined leases were necessary, the leasing costs would be the respondent's responsibility.","The applicant school board sought a declaration that the Province of Nova Scotia is responsible to provide school buildings required for the delivery of a basic Public School Program to the students of the province and the Province bears the responsibility for negotiations and payment of rental costs associated with the leases. The issue was whether the Minister of Education (Minister) was required to reimburse the Cape Breton Board for the costs incurred by the Board in leasing the school buildings from the Church. The applicant board sought to have the declaration declared that it was the Province responsible to supply school buildings to the Board and that the cost of such a lease was the responsibility of the Province. HELD: Where the Minister has received a request in the proper form and determined with the approval of the Governor in Council that it is necessary to lease a school building in order to meet the Province's statutory obligation, the cost will be the province's responsibility. The lease costs are to the same extent as would be the costs of supplying the building free of costs. There shall be no costs."
"An appeal from an order which quashed an interim order of the Labour Relations Board (LRB) pending the determination of a grievance by an arbitration board, even though no proceedings were pending before the LRB and even though it had no power to make a final order respecting the proceedings before the arbitration board. At issue was whether s5.3 of the Trade Union Act authorized the Board to make such an order. HELD: The appeal was dismissed with costs.  1)The Board recognized the question to be a jurisdictional question. The standard of review is whether the decision was correct rather than patently unreasonable. 2)The chambers judge arrived at the correct conclusion whether from the point of view of the plain meaning of the words of s5.3 or the context of the entire statute or a purposive approach.  3)S5.3 refers to the 'board' which is defined by s2(c) to be the LRB and accordingly referred to applications and orders of the LRB. The interim power is not only based on the final power but is also part of the final power and both are part of the same process. 4)S25(1), when read with ss(1.1) and (1.2) indicates an intention on the part of the legislators to grant exclusive jurisdiction to arbitration boards to deal with disputes arising out of the interpretation of collective agreements. 5)Whatever the scope of s42, it cannot be used to release the restrictions of a statutory provision the very purpose of which is to define the jurisdiction of the LRB to act in respect of such matters.","This appeal was from an order which quashed an interim order of the Labour Relations Board pending the determination of a grievance by an arbitration board, even though no proceedings were pending before the Board and even though it had no power to make any final order respecting the proceedings before the arbitration board. HELD: The appeal was dismissed with costs in the usual way. Whether one approaches the question from the point of view of the plain meaning of the words of s.5.3, or from the context of the entire statute, or a purposive approach, the result is the same. The chambers judge arrived at a correct conclusion."
"At issue was whether the right of appeal to a board of revision against a municipal tax assessment was exercised properly having regard for s303(1) of the Rural Municipality Act and how and when notice was given. The company posted the notice of appeal by registered mail the day before the expiration of the 20 day appeal period. The notice arrived at the post office on a Friday, the day after the period expired and was picked up by the administrator the following Monday. The Appeals Committee refused to direct the board of revision to hear the appeal on the basis the company failed to give notice within the period prescribed by s303(1) and concluded that the board did not have the power to extend the time. HELD: The appeal was allowed. The board of revision was directed to hear and determine the assessment appeal. 1)The Committee did not err in deciding the prescribed time period for an appeal could not be extended.  2)The less formal expression 'to give notice to' as used in the Act is a less exacting term than 'to serve notice upon'. Wascana Energy exercised its right of appeal properly, or at least effectively, requiring the board of revision to entertain the appeal.","The question in this case is whether the right of appeal to a board of revision against a municipal tax assessment was exercised properly, or at least effectively, having regard for the governing provisions of the statute and the fact of how and when notice of appeal was given. HELD: The appeal from the decision of the Committee was allowed with costs as usual and an order directing the board of revisions to hear and determine the company's appeal. The court found that the legislature intended to have the right exercised properly. The phrase'may give notice in writing' must be taken by implication to allow for notice to be given by means of registered mail. If it were otherwise, the administrator would have declined to act upon the notice and the board would not have the power to extend the period. If the enactment allows for giving notice by registered mail, then this case gives rise to a different set of issues. At best, this amounts to substantial compliance of near perfect sort. At worst, it amounts to a complete failure to exercise the right to appeal within the prescribed period. This is a comparatively narrow context, concerned as it is with the meaning of the word give in virtual isolation, removed from the purpose of the subsection and the objectives of its terms."
"The plaintiff lawyer commenced an action for fees and disbursements in the amount of $4,647.85. The proposed garnishee, SPMC, paid $337.46 into court and brought an application for an order pursuant to Rules 411 and 415(1) of the Queen's Bench Rules of Court. An order that any further amounts due and owing from SPMC to the company be paid into court to be disposed as directed by the court was granted with taxed costs to SPMC. Labour Standards filed notice of potential wage claims. The plaintiff obtained default judgment and made an ex parte application for payment out of the monies paid into court by SPMC. HELD: The applicant/plaintiff was to be paid all monies paid into court by SPMC with respect to the two files together with accrued interest less the amount previously paid out. The claim by the Minister of Labour was dismissed. Although the monies paid into court according to the decision in Polyco Window Manufacturing Ltd v. Prudential Assurance Co create a fund from which creditors must be paid, the claim by the Minister of Labour as of the date of the application was not a proven claim. No certificate had been issued and no judgment had been entered as of that date. A judgment had been filed by the plaintiff. He was the only party entitled to the monies.","The plaintiff practised law in the Province of Saskatchewan and commenced an action against the defendant, 626170 Saskatchewan Ltd., for fees and disbursements in the amount of $4,647.85. On March 9, 1999, the plaintiff obtained a garnishee summons issued prior to judgment against the said defendant and served it on Saskatchewan Property Management Corporation (""SPMC"") the proposed garnishhee. As a result of the garnishehee, the sum of $337.46 was paid into court to the credit of Q.B.G. 639 of 1999 and $968.39. On April 13, 1999 the Minister of Labour served a notice with the registrar of the Court of Queen's Bench of their claim with respect to potential wage claims owing by the defendant company to its employees pursuant to s. 54 of The Labour Standards Act. At the time of the application for payment out, Tapp had not obtained judgment against either defendant company and there was no certificate of the Minister on file. That order was granted by Justice Wright together with costs to SPMC to be taxed. HELD: The claim was dismissed. 1)The claim was not proven. 2)The plaintiff was a practising lawyer in the province of Saskatchewan. 3)No certificate had been entered by the Minister as to the date the application was made. 4)There had been a third party claim by the Director of Labour Standards directed that the application be made by notice of motion and that all parties interested in the funds should be served."
The accused was charged with failure to provide forthwith a breath sample contrary to Criminal Code s.254(5). HELD: The accused was found not guilty. The court accepted the evidence of the accused where there was a discrepancy between the testimony of the officer and the accused. The mental element of the offence of refusal consists of intentional non-compliance. The officer in his conversation with another officer said he could not understand why he was not getting a proper sample. There was a reasonable doubt that the officer did understand why he was not getting a proper sample and could not provide the accused with adequate instructions.,"The accused was charged with failing to comply with a demand made to him by a peace officer pursuant to s. 254(2)(a) of the Criminal Code to provide forthwith a sample of his breath as in the opinion of Cst. Rozario. The accused chose not to disclose in his disclosure information the name of the 'ride along' nor even that there was a ride along.. HELD: The accused's evidence was accepted. The officer's lack of cander in giving his testimony raised doubts in my mind as to his forthrightness in respect to other important details in this matter. For reasons which will discuss later in this decision, where there is a discrepancy between the testimony of the officer and that of the accused, the Court accepts the evidence.  1) The accused was not intentionally trying to avoid providing an adequate sample. He was attempting to supply sample as directed by the officer. 2) The officer was wearing white sunglasses placed on top of his head. He testified that when the police vehicle approached his vehicle from the rear, its lights were very bright.. He reached over and “flipped” the rear view mirror of his vehicle and pulled over to the right as he did not want this vehicle to continue to follow him.. The officer testified that he was on patrol in the Paddockwood District when the accused's vehicle swerved to the left side of the highway more than necessary as he approached it.. He was told to blow into the machine. He blew three times in all. He did not inform the accused of anything.. The accused wrote on the Promise to Appeal served on him: “I did not refuse breathalyser”.  3) Although the accused had not told the young, inexperienced officer of why he thought he may have been having difficulty blowing sufficient sample for the officer, he did tell the court that he is asthmatic.. His asthma is worse when exposed to animal hair.. The evening before he helped his son skin a deer which his son had just shot.. He had to use his prescribed inhaler then and again at the party where he had had his two or three beer.. He did remember the officer telling him that it was like blowing up a balloon.  4) The evidence was that the officer stopped the second test as the accused was blowing outside the mouthpiece again.. He waited for the ready light to come on.. He explained to the accused that he needed steady breath and that his lips had to be sealed over. He ceased the test. ran another set of"
"The appellants applied for leave to amend their notice of appeal in regard to an order requiring them to post security for costs with respect to certain interlocutory applications. The application was opposed, inter alia, on the basis that the allegations which underlie the proposed amendment were not justiciable issues before the trial judge, were irrelevant on the application and were not ruled on by the trial judge. Application to amend the notice of appeal allowed; the amendment is reasonably necessary for the presentation of the appeal and will not occasion prejudice to the respondent. The respondent's opposition to the application fundamentally misconceived the role of a chambers judge who is asked to grant leave to amend a notice of appeal. It is not the role of a chambers judge to rule on the substantive merits of the arguments the appellants wish to make. The focus in this situation is on whether there is any prejudice to the respondent as a result of this issue being raised by amendment rather than in the original notice of appeal.","The appellants apply for leave to amend their notice of appeal. Leave is required because the notice was filed more than 20 days ago: Rule 62.04(4).. The application is opposed by the respondent 2301072 Nova Scotia Limited and the intervenor. As, in their view, their arguments in opposition to the amendment relate to the merits of the point raised by it, those arguments are for a panel and not chambers judge to consider. The amendments will not interfere with the date set for filing the appeal book or result in any wasted effort to address the appeal as originally framed."
"HELD: The appeal as to the convictions and the sentences imposed was dismissed. The court found with respect to each issue that the trial judge had not erred: 1) the defence had acknowledged the appellant had used force and that his spouse had not consented to it. Therefore the appellant could not argue on appeal that the trial judge failed to take implied consent into account. The trial judge was entitled to accept the spouse’s testimony as she was not cross-examined at trial. There was nothing in the transcript that showed the trial judge took a zero tolerance approach. The trial judge found that defence of de minimis was not open to the appellant based on her finding that the application of force by the appellant was more than trifling. On appeal, the court could not substitute its view of the evidence from that of the trial judge; 2) the trial judge found that the appellant intentionally drove in a manner that he knew created a danger for others and to frighten his spouse. She was entitled to conclude the appellant’s conduct was a marked departure from that expected of reasonably prudent driver. The evidence was reasonably capable of supporting her decision; and 3) the appellant had not identified how the trial judge had erred on any of the grounds an appeal court could consider. It was not open to it to intervene only because it would have weighed sentencing factors differently from the trial judge.",HELD: The appeal from the dangerous driving conviction was dismissed. The trial judge found the accused guilty of dangerous driving and assault. The evidence was nonetheless reasonably capable of supporting the decision made by the trial judge. The court found that the accused had intentionally driven his vehicle and pushed the complainant to the side of the road to avoid an accident. The accused conceded that all elements of the offence had been made out which necessarily included the intentional application of force. The Court held that the evidence was found to support the accused's conclusion.
"On appeal from 106 SaskR 277. 47 year old respondent, former President and Chief Executive Officer of STC, had been awarded $165,000 (18 months) for wrongful dismissal. He had successively served three Crown Corporations over a period of ten years. On appeal held the award of damages was not inordinately high. The court however reduced the damages by $16,500 as it disagreed with the trial judge's determination regarding mitigation of damages. Appeal allowed to the extent of reducing the damages from $165,000 to $148,500.","This is an appeal from an assessment of damages in a wrongful dismissal action brought against Saskatchewan Transportation Company by Leo Larsen, its former President and Chief Executive Officer. For the most part we can find no tenable basis for concluding that the award of damages was inordinately high. The trial judge assessed the damages on the general principles, that the object of these awards is to compensate for the loss of income sustained in consequence of the wrongful dismissal; second, that their measure is prima facie the amount that would have been earned had the employment continued subject to deduction of such amounts as in the ensuing months are either earned or should be earned in light of the duty upon persons suffering losses to keep them to minimum. The Crown Employment Contracts Act had set aside contractual provisions for payment on dismissal contained in all Crown contracts, and directed instead that payment be determined in accordance with common law principle. The appellant was awarded $165,000, an amount that was exorbitant."
"An application to vary the terms of a 1995 consent judgment such that the applicant would have sole custody. Alternatively he sought an order preventing the mother from removing their daughter from Saskatchewan. The father obtained an ex parte order preventing the mother from removing the child from the province until the return date of the motion. The mother had always been the primary caregiver and had custody since the separation in 1994. The father had exercised regular and frequent access. She was given exclusive possession of the matrimonial home under the terms of the consent judgment which contemplated the home would be listed for sale and the net proceeds divided between the parties. Subsequent to the consent judgment the applicant went through bankruptcy proceedings in which he transferred his interest in the home to the trustee who then sold that interest to the respondent such that the applicant no longer had any interest in the home. HELD: 1)Relocation was neither foreseen nor reasonably contemplated by the judge making the original order. The threshold criteria was thus satisfied. 2)The trial of an issue was required as the matter could not be decided on the basis of affidavit evidence. The child had a close relationship with both parents. The disruption as a result of a change in custody or removal of the child from the community could not be assessed. 3)The applicant's request for interim relief was denied. If the mother proceeded with her move a revision of the access provision would be appropriate. 4)The child's best interest is the proper test to be applied (Cote) having regard to the factors identified by the Supreme Court of Canada in Gordon. 5)The applicant became aware in early June of the mother's intention to move to British Columbia and did not object. The timing of the application, a few weeks prior to the proposed move, raised the suspicion that it was the respondent's decision to sell the matrimonial home which prompted this application.  6)Costs were left to the trial judge.","The applicant sought an order preventing the respondent from removing their daughter from the Province of Saskatchewan. The consent judgment provided that the applicant would have sole custody of the child and that relocation was either foreseen or would have been reasonably contemplated. HELD: The application was granted. The trial of an issue was required. 1)The applicant did not take the position that it was the respondent's decision to sell the matrimonial home that prompted this application. 2)The respondent was aware that the child had always been the primary care. giver. During the marriage she was stay-at-home mom and raised their daughter. 3)The child had a close relationship with both parents, however that only scratched the surface in terms of the relationship between the parent and child. As a result of a change in custody or removal the child from the community would be required. 4)The Court reviewed the factors identified by the Supreme Court of Canada in Gordon, supra. 5)While there is no legal presumption in favour of the custodial parent, her views are entitled to great respect, the Court was not able to reassess the effect of a disruption as a consequence of the change in Custody or Removal of the Child from the Community."
"FIAT. The accused, charged with trafficking in a narcotic, sought an order for a judicial stay of proceedings pursuant to s.24(1) and (2) of the Charter on the basis his right under s.11(b) to be tried within a reasonable time has been breached. HELD: The application was dismissed. The delay was not unreasonable.  1)The 25 months between when the charge was laid in May 1996 and the trial date in November 1998 was sufficiant delay to raise the issue of the reasonableness of the delay. Defence did not waive delay. 2)There was no reason given for the three and one-half month delay between the swearing of the information and the arrest. The accused's right to a fair trial had not been prejudiced by the total time delay. His right to security of person and to liberty were not affected. 3)Seven months delay was due to scheduling delays resulting from defence's application to remove prosecution counsel who had previously represented the accused. The Crown acted in good faith in opposing the application and had a meritorious position. 4)All other proceedings were within the systemic guidelines. 5)Prejudice to his liberty was minor as he was on bail since shortly after his arrest. He was able to make full answer and defence. He was employed throughout since his release. His inability to enter long term contracts or travel out of province would have existed for 21-1/2 months of the 25 month delay in any event. 6)Individual and family stress is to be expected. The minor prejudice beyond the normal and expected was not sufficient to outweigh society's interest in bringing those charged with criminal offences to trial.",FIAT. The accused sought a judicial stay of proceedings pursuant to ss.24(1) and (2) of the Charter on the basis his right under s.11(b) to be tried within a reasonable time had been breached. HELD: The application was dismissed. 1)The Court found that the delay in the circumstances was not unreasonable. 2)The accused had been on bail since shortly after his arrest. He agreed the delay had not resulted in a diminution of his ability to make full answer and defence. 3)His right to a fair trial had not been prejudiced by the total delay involved. The Court described the prejudice to his liberty interest as minor.
"FIAT. The plaintiff applied for summary judgment in his claim for dismissal without just cause. The plaintiff was initially hired as body shop foreman but additionally acquired the title of assistant manager. When the body shop manager became ill that work load also fell to the plaintiff. It was during this period that the performance of the plaintiff, described by the defendant as serious misconduct, resulted in his termination. There was no issue of a lack of mitigation as the plaintiff accepted a job with another autobody shop but at a much lower rate of pay. The action was brought pursuant to the simplified procedure outlined in Part 40 of the Rules of Court. HELD: Damages were to be calculated by the parties for the 7 month notice period based on his income and value of benefits over the previous year, less the 6 weeks pay received, and less wages and benefits received from his new employment. Jurisdiction was reserved to hear further evidence should the parties not reach agreement. 1)By using the words 'shall grant judgment unless', Rule 488 requires the presiding judge to grant judgment except in the circumstances outlined in s.488(a)and(b). The test is not whether there is contradictory evidence in the affidavits but whether despite the contradictory evidence the issue(s) can be decided in the absence of cross-examination and it would be otherwise unjust to do so. If the court can assume the defendant's evidence is true and still grant summary judgment there is no genuine need for a trial. 2)As noted in numerous decisions, whether an employer is justified in summarily dismissing an employee is ultimately a question of fact. The plaintiff was not terminated because of poor job performance in performing his contractual duties as foreman and manager but because of his alleged poor performance in doing the job normally assigned to two persons. The employer has the right to expect that employees will not disparage their immediate supervisors or other employees in the course of their employment and certainly not to clients or customers of the employer. The type of conduct here would not justify dismissal the first time it came to the employer's attention if the employee had been guilty of such conduct while performing only his own job function. 'Griping' is not uncommon in the workplace. The case law seems uniform that one or more warnings to an employee must be given before it can be said such activity 'fractures the employment relationship'. The category of misconduct can be said to change from poor attitude to disobedience or insubordination where dismissal results after one or more warnings. 3)The plaintiff was entitled to 7 months notice to reflect the fact that junior management positions are fewer in number and the considerable wage difference between management and non- management positions.  4)The plaintiff was entitled to taxable costs.","FIAT: The plaintiff applies for summary judgment in his claim for dismissal without just cause brought pursuant to the simplified procedure outlined in Part Forty of the Rules of Court. The defendant opposes the application and requests summary trial. HELD: 1) The defendant shall grant judgment unless the presiding judge is unable to decide the issues in the action in the absence of cross-examination; or, it would be otherwise unjust to order a summary trial or the trial of specified issue or issues. Taking all factors into account, the defendant bears the burden of demonstrating there is a genuine need for trial.  2) In this case the alleged misconduct of the plaintiff would have justified him being warned to not continue such conduct, but it falls far short of conduct justifying cause for termination. 3) The plaintiff's counsel put forward a realistic assessment of an appropriate notice period of 7 months, which he considered an appropriate time period to which the plaintiff was entitled."
"The son of unmarried parents, who had graduated from high school, was working part-time, living with his mother and had not made a final decision on a further course of study sustained a serious brain injury just a few months after his 19th birthday. He required extensive rehabilitation and would not regain his pre-accident physical and intellectual capacity. The mother successfully applied for a reinstatement of child support which had been discontinued by consent, pre-accident, when the son was residing with the father. The son, now 23 years old, was upgrading his high school marks at the time of the hearing and hoped to be admitted to a community college program. The father appealed. Appeal dismissed; the judge's decision to award support was not premised upon a finding that, pre-accident, the son had made a clear decision to pursue a further course of study but on the fact that the son intended to pursue his education and had not withdrawn from parental charge at the time of the accident. There was no evidence to support the allegation that the usual Guideline amount was 'inappropriate' in this case; the Act prohibited the consideration of public income assistance when fixing child support; given the uncertainty about the son's future, this was not an appropriate case for a time-limited order.","This was an appeal from an order made pursuant to the Maintenance and Custody Act requiring the appellant father, Gilbert Hill, to pay maintenance for his son, who was now 19 years old. HELD: The appeal was dismissed with costs payable by Mr. Hill to Ms. Davis in the amount of $2,000. The Court was not persuaded that the judge erred in concluding that the child had not withdrawn and was unable to withdraw from his parent's charge at the time of the accident. It was not an appropriate case for a time-limited order. There was no evidentiary basis upon which the judge could conclude that the Guideline amount was inappropriate and depart from it."
"The plaintiff, who was injured in a rear-end motor vehicle accident, applied for summary judgment and an interim payment of damages. Application for summary judgment granted; application for interim payment dismissed. There was no 'air of reality' to the defendant's defence; whether or not the plaintiff's brake lights were working, to strike her vehicle from behind on these facts meant that the defendant was either travelling too close or didn't have enough care and control of his vehicle. The plaintiff was making a significant claim for damages but she suffered from numerous previous injuries and conditions relating to her health; any damage assessment would depend largely upon credibility and the medical evidence at trial; to assess interim damages in this case would be a most difficult task and would only be a haphazard guess. The plaintiff's claim was also complicated by the fact that it could possibly be subject to the 'minor injury' cap on damages.","This was an application for summary judgment pursuant to Civil Procedure Rule 13.01 and an interim payment under the Civil Procedure Rules 31.01. The plaintiff was operating her motor vehicle and said in her affidavit that she was struck from behind by one of the defendants named in the motor vehicle accident. The defendant argued there was a significant amount of other factors relating to the health of the plaintiff. HELD: The appeal was allowed and the costs were set aside. 1)There had to be an 'air of realty' to the defendant's argument. 2)Any amount of assessed damages which might be arrived at would depend largely upon credibility and medical evidence at trial. 3)The plaintiff was making a significant claim yet when one listens to defendant's counsel and reads the material attached to the plaintiff's affidavit, one concludes there is a significant number other factors that the plaintiff has not been able to establish. 4)Costs in the cause of the action would be a haphazard guess."
"The accused successfully challenged the sufficiency of the grounds to issue a search warrant that was used to search her residence. Although the Information to Obtain was based on information from an anonymous, unproven source, the source's information was corroborated by independent information as to the accused's employment and residence. The only corroboration of the presence of a crime (a suspected marijuana grow operation) was from a FLIR test. The court found that the evidence did not rise above the level of suspicion, albeit strong suspicion. Corroboration of the employment and residence of the accused did not provide particular support for the informant's credibility; neither were results of the FLIR test and the presence of covered windows sufficient corroboration. The Crown appealed. Appeal allowed; new trial ordered. Although the trial judge articulated the proper test and began by analyzing whether the warrant could have been issued, the issue was later mistakenly transformed into whether he, himself, would have issued it. By weighing the probative evidence, the trial judge effectively substituted his views for those of the issuing justice and wrongly required the issuing justice to draw proper inferences as opposed to reasonable inferences.","The Crown appealed the decision to quash the respondent's search warrant, alleging that it was issued without sufficient information. HELD: The appeal was allowed and a new trial ordered. The trial judge substituted his view of the evidence for that of the issuing judge. The court found that what began as an analysis of whether the warrant could have been issued became an exercise where the judge ultimately considered whether he would have issued it. The judge applied the standard of review that he so ably articulated in R. v. Garofoli, [1990] and found that the evidence obtained as a result of the search was 'credibly-based' and that there was evidence of a marijuana grow operation in the residence. The evidence obtained from the tipster was not sufficient to establish a reasonable and probable grounds for the search. The Court found that even had the warrant been properly quashed, the respondent would have been found to have been acquitted. A new trial was ordered."
"This is an application by the accused for an order that evidence obtained by way of a telephone interception be ruled inadmissible because it is irrelevant. Alternatively, the accused seeks exclusion of the intercepted communication on the basis that it was conducted in violation of s. 8 of the Charter and ought to be excluded under s. 24(2). The accused is charged with abuse of a position of trust contrary to s. 153(1)(a) of the Code. HELD: The evidence is admissible. The accused's application is dismissed. 1) After examining the transcript of the conversation, it is immediately evident that the contents of the communication are relevant. The complainant and the accused are discussing the intimate details of their relationship. The conversation is logically probative to the charge. 2) The learned provincial court judge did in fact have sufficient evidence before him to issue the telephone intercept authorization. The complainant was prepared to initiate a telephone call to the accused and engage him in a conversation which would likely cause the accused to make admissions or statements which could be confirmatory of her allegations. 3) The authorization clearly permits the police to intercept private communications in relation to an offence under s. 271(1) of the Code. That investigation was live and bona fide at the time that the authorization was obtained. The law in this country is that evidence of other crimes revealed during the course of a lawful intercept process does not render the evidence obtained inadmissible in relation to an offence not named in the authorization. The focus is on whether the interception was lawfully obtained and executed, not on what is discovered. Here the police obtained a valid authorization to intercept private communications in relation to an offence under s. 271(1) of the Code. During the investigation of that charge, they obtained evidence which is relevant to an offence under s. 153(1)(a) of the Code. The fact that the offence of s. 153(1)(a) is not named in the authorization nor included as an offence for which an authorization to intercept private communications could be obtained, does not affect the admissibility of the evidence. Therefore, there is no Charter breach. 4) Even if the evidence was obtained in violation of s. 8 of the Charter, such evidence is considered non-conscriptive evidence. Where the evidence is non-conscriptive, the court ought to go on to do a balancing as to whether or not the evidence ought to be excluded pursuant to s. 24(2) of the Charter. The factors to be considered are trial fairness, seriousness of the breach and the effect of exclusion. In this case if there is a breach, it was not serious and was inadvertent, the result of unmindful draftsmanship. There is no evidence of bad faith. There is no evidence of manipulation. The seriousness of the breach, if there was one, was minimal, and to admit the evidence would not bring the administration of justice into disrepute.","The accused applied for an order that evidence obtained by way of a telephone interception be ruled inadmissible because it is irrelevant. Alternatively, he sought exclusion of the intercepted conversation on the basis that it was conducted in violation of s. 8 of the Charter. HELD: 1)The evidence was relevant and admissible and ought not to be excluded. The learned provincial court judge did in fact have sufficient evidence before him to issue the telephone intercept authorization.  2)The Court reviewed the provisions of the Criminal Code and the relevant case authorities and concluded that there was no Charter breach and that the evidence was admissible. 3)There was no evidence of bad faith, bad faith or manipulation. The evidence should be considered to be conscriptive evidence because the consenting party essentially acted as police agent in. the course of the conversation. It was reasonable to presume that such a scenario could quite likely result in producing evidence highly relevant to the investigation."
"Counsel for the plaintiffs brings two notices of motion seeking 1) the opportunity to cross-examine a deponent on her affidavit and 2) an order to compel one of defendants to supply pre-certification notices to all persons who may be eligible to participate in the class action that is contemplated. HELD: The motions are dismissed with no order as to costs.  1) One of defendants contends that 7 people alleged by the plaintiffs to be viable class members have already entered into a full and final settlement with the defendant. This defendant earlier sought to examine these individuals. The Justice of this action at that time did not allow the examination but instead made an order permitting the defendant to file affidavits on the issue. This is the source of the affidavit the plaintiff seeks cross-examination on. The order also allowed the plaintiffs to file reply affidavits, which they chose not to do. There is nothing in the original order that could be interpreted as saying that the plaintiffs could cross-examine on the affidavit. In the view of the Court, having chosen not to file reply affidavits pursuant to the original order, it is not reasonable for plaintiff's counsel to embark on a totally different approach several weeks after the deadline has passed. There is also some concern that the actual purpose of the proposed cross-examination would be more general and broad-ranging than a mere challenge to the defendant's assertion that the individuals at issue have already entered into full and final settlements with the defendant.  2) In its barest sense, plaintiffs' counsel requests that the defendant supply a plaintiff by way of sending pre-certification notices to its clients. The Court is aware of Lewis v. Shell, where an Ontario court ordered notice to potential class members. However, that case is not similar to this case. In the Lewis case, the Court was faced with concern over the defendant contacting individuals who might be potential class members for the purpose of obtaining early settlements. Moreover, the Ontario class actions legislation is less restrictive than Saskatchewan's. The section of the Class Action Act which may permit such an order refer to a 'class action,' not an 'action.' As this case is still in the pre-certification stage, it is not yet a class action within the meaning of the Act. Spavier v. Canada also indicates that pre-certification motions of this sort would rarely be successful in this jurisdiction.","The plaintiff brought a motion pursuant to s. 12 of The Class Actions Act of Ontario for an order compelling the defendant to produce a list of proposed class members who had been provided with a letter and related package by the defendant (relating to test of their premises for contamination). The defendant moved to dismiss the motion on the basis that the plaintiff could not rely on s. 14 prior to certification of the action as a class action. HELD: The application was dismissed. 1) This is still an 'action' and not a 'class action'. An action is defined as an action that defined the Queen's Bench Act as meaning 'an action certified as class action pursuant to Part II' and Class Action is defined under s. 43(2) of the Class Action Act. 2) The plaintiff was granted leave to cross examine the defendant on her affidavit. 3) The court reviewed the words of s.14 and s.24 of our Act in my view and the context of the preparation of the Moore affidavit. 4) Based on the plain wording of Justice Ottenbreit J.’s judgment, the Court found that the limitation is suspended only if the action is certified. 5) The Court was not prepared to broaden the scope of the s.12 provisions of the Ontario Class Proceedings Act to include a suspension of the limitation period for actions that are not certified. 6) It was important to note that the practices and the implementation of The Rules of Court do not get suspended merely because this matter has been certified."
"At issue is the amount of Income Replacement Benefits (IRB) payable to the appellant by SGI. The parties agree that the calculation of the IRB as provided by s. 117 of the Act is the annualized sum of $28,889.75. The appellant takes issue with SGI's reduction of the amount determined in accordance with s. 117 of the Act by calculating the appellant's net income in accordance with s. 135 to s. 138 of the Act. HELD: SGI has correctly calculated the appellant's IRB when it made the requisite deductions as set out in s. 137 to find the appellant's net income, and then reduced the net income to 90% to determine his IRB. It would be neither a rational nor fair interpretation to reduce a full-time earner's IRB by 90% and not the other types of earners. It would be neither a rational nor fair interpretation to deduct income tax, employment insurance premiums and Canada Pension contributions from only full-time earners. All earners are subject to these payments being deducted from their income but for their inability to earn an income because of an automobile accident. The further deductions to obtain the non- earner's IRB are in keeping with his earning reality.","HELD: The court found that SGI had correctly calculated Montgrand's IRB when it made the requisite deductions as set out in s. 137 and (3) of the Act and reduced the IRB by 90% and not the other types of earners. It would be neither a rational nor fair interpretation to deduct income tax, employment insurance premiums and Canada Pension contributions from only full-time earners. All earners are subject to these payments being deducted from their income but for their inability to earn an income because of an automobile accident. The legislation attempts to find the non-earner's earning reality. The IRB for the 181st and subsequent days following an accident should not be less than the amount received for the first 180 days after the accident. HELD: SGI was correct in applying Regulation 102 of the Pre-judgment Interest Act. The Court found that the Act is intended to correlate a victim's income replacement benefit against which s. 117(4) is designed to be measured is that of 'weighted average' calculation. 1) The Court held that s. 136(1) is subservient to the other provisions of this Division and no further reduction ought to be made. 2) SGI did not err in holding that the income replacement benefits payable during the post 180 day period were not less than what Montgrand received pursuant to s. 116(1). SGI appealed SGI's calculation of interest on monies owed to Montgrand on the basis of pre-judgement interest. SGI argued that the act was intended to be a 'governed by' or 'affected by' the provisions of the Personal Injury Benefits Regulations. However, the Court of Appeal referred the matter of determination of the calculation of Montgrand’s IRB (the “IRB”) for both the first 181 day period and post 180 days to determine his IRB. Counsel for Montgrand appealed the SGI calculation. Counsel now concedes that the insurer was correct."
"The appellant contests an order for $600.00 monthly spousal support given by a Chambers judge on an application to review a previous order which granted the respondent $300.00 monthly spousal support for a period of 1 year. The parties were married for 24 years following a 2-year period of cohabitation. They have 2 adult children, one of which is largely supported by the appellant. Both parties have some health problems. Originally, the appellant was ordered to pay the respondent $300.00 in monthly spousal support for a period of 1 year. Given the appellant's health difficulties and the fact that he was nearing retirement, the trial judge noted that the respondent would do well to become self-sufficient as soon as possible. The Chambers judge who reviewed the original order found that, during the year period the respondent was collecting spousal support, she had not engaged in any gainful employment. She had sold her house and used the proceeds to spend over 4 months living in Hawaii and Jamaica. She obtained probationary employment just after filing a notice of motion but lost the job before the hearing commenced. HELD: The appeal is allowed, the orders of the Chambers judge for spousal support and costs against the appellant are set aside. The Chambers judge imputed an income of $14,289 to the respondent on the basis that she was capable of working 30 hours per week at minimum wage. He did not indicate why he did not find her capable of full time employment. The Chambers judge made an error in calculating the income of the appellant. He also discounted the expenses borne by the appellant in relation the maintenance of their adult child, who was a full-time student. It was incumbent on the respondent to establish that she was unable to become self-sufficient. The evidence did not begin to establish that and, in fact, clearly showed that she made little effort to do so within the year allocated by the trial judge.","This appeal from a spousal support order was allowed orally from the bench for the reasons set out in Rimmer v. Adshead 2004 SKQB 536 (CanLII). It is clear that Ottenbreit J. set an order for fixed and short term in order to give the respondent an opportunity to find appropriate employment and become self sufficient.. The evidence did not begin to establish that and, in fact, clearly showed that she had made no effort at all to do so within the year allocated by the order and prior to the filing of the notice of motion, and little effort between that time and the hearing of the application."
"The appellant pled guilty to perjury and was sentenced to two years imprisonment. He appealed the sentence as being excessive and too harsh. Allowing the appeal and varying the sentence to nine months, that while perjury is a very serious offence, the sentence exceeded the range imposed for offences of this nature.","This was an appeal of a sentence of two years imprisonment for perjury imposed by the Provincial Court on October 8, 1992. Dismissing the appeal, that the upper end of the range of sentences for this offence did not appear to have reached 2 years. The aggravating factors were serious and fell within a lower classification of time to be served."
"The Wife sought an interim distribution of matrimonial property and periodic maintenance for the 2 children of the marriage, aged 16 and 13. The Husband had not made an interim lump sum payment in the amount of $2,000.00 ordered in May and had undertaken to provide support monies after harvest. The Husband claimed that the value of the crop harvested was less than the farm expenses and resisted any change in the previous interim orders made. HELD: Application dismissed. The Court was not prepared to make the interim orders requested on the basis of the contradictory affidavits filed. A pre-trial was directed.","The applicant sought an interim distribution of matrimonial property and interim support for her two children, ages 16 and 13. An interim order granted exclusive possession of the parties' farm home with the exception of the tool shed and other parts of the farm yard. Both parties were ordered to have no contact with one other and to pay $2,000 lump sum. support for the children at the end of the 1994 harvest. The respondent was ordered to pay periodic child support if he got a job off the farm. HELD: The application was granted and the respondent was prohibited from contacting the applicant and from going to her home or her workplace. An earlier consent order forbade the respondent from disposing of the property. Since then, the respondent has continued to dispose of farm machinery and the 1994 crop. The applicant has sought an order prohibiting him from entering the farm home and the farmyard now that he is finished farming for the year. An extended order in May prohibiting the husband from accessing the tools shed and farm yard retroactive to July 1. The husband was also ordered to be denied the right to enter any tool shed or farm yard after he has finished farming. The Court was not prepared to vary or extend the order of May27 and the extended order of October 19 which forbids the husbandfrom approaching the home quarter."
"FIAT. The Crown applied to have a witness, who was an unindicted co-conspirator and separately charged with drug offences arising out of the same investigation, declared adverse pursuant to s9 of the Canada Evidence Act. She had contradicted her prior video taped statement made shortly after her arrest and had demonstrated hostile attitude towards the Crown. The defence took the position that she was now telling the truth; that the statement was improperly obtained in breach of the confession rules of voluntariness and the statement did not meet the requirements set out in R. v. K.G.B. HELD: The witness' prior statement may be introduced in evidence for the substantive truth of its contents. It will be for the jury to decide what, if any, portions of such statement they wish to accept. 1)A prior inconsistent statement cannot be introduced in evidence for its substantive content, unless the requirement of necessity, and a threshold of reliability arrived at on a balance of probabilities are established. When, as here, a witness recants, the requirement of necessity is established. The real issue is whether the prior statement meets the test for reliability. When, as here, there is only one demonstrably false piece of testimony in the statement, which does not implicate anyone but rather attempts to exonerate someone, the Court was not prepared to say ipso facto the statement is unreliable. 2)The independent evidence sufficiently corroborated her statement in enough different particulars that, but for the demonstrably false portion, it met the threshold of reliability.","FIAT. The Crown applied to have the witness declared adverse pursuant to s.9 of the Canada Evidence Act on the basis that in the course of giving her evidence to date, she has demonstrated a hostile attitude towards the position of the Crown, and hascontradicted in a substantial way, her prior video-taped statement made shortly after her arrest. HELD: The Crown sought to use the prior statement, not only for the purposes of impeaching her credibility at trial, but also as substantive evidence that may be left with the jury at the end of the trial. 1)The evidence of the police officer who interviewed the witness prior to her arrest was unreliable. 2)The Crown was entitled to place the witness's prior statement on the evidence for its substantive content, unless the requirement of necessity, and a threshold of reliability arrived at on a balance of probabilities are established."
"The accused, employed as doorman and relief bartender at the time of the altercation, was charged with assault causing bodily harm in which the complainant sustained significant injuries to his head and face. Three crown witnesses and five defence witnesses testified as to the altercation in the bar. HELD: The accused was found guilty. 1)The self-defence argument was not accepted. Neither s.34 or s.37 of the Criminal Code justified the assault. 2)The testimony of the Crown witnesses was accepted. The complainant was no threat to the accused in his inebriated state and the accused took advantage of the situation to administer a beating to him. The injuries were not consistent with the scenario described by the accused and the witnesses.","The accused was charged with assault causing bodily harm. HELD: The accused was found guilty. 1)The Crown did not accept the defence's argument that the accused was acting in self-defence. Even if he was, he used more force than necessary. Neither s.34 or s.37 of the Criminal Code justifies the assault. The accused did not commit assault.  2)The court accepted the accused's evidence that he threw only one punch, or Lillis'evidence that he and Layman knocked the victim out by falling on him. The injuries were not consistent with this scenario."
"The parties were married in September 1996 and subsequently separated in April of 1999. The parties both seek custody of their only child born in October 1997. The issues before the court is interim custody and primary residence of the child, access by the other parent and interim child maintenance. The parties filed evidence that was considerably contradictory relating to each other and respective abilities as parent. viva voce hearing was held to assist determining the questions of credibility. The mother aged 31 years of age, is employed as secretary. The mother remained at home during the first year of the child's birth then returned to work. The mother suffered from post partum depression following the child's birth and as result attempted to commit suicide. She was hospitalized for three weeks to receive psychiatric assistance. The psychiatrist who treated the mother states the mother is unlikely to have future suicide attempts and has responded well to treatment. The child was with the mother every afternoon during her hospitalization and the mother bonded with her son. The father is currently employed at Ipsco on shift work and is currently living with his parents. The father has had the child since the separation and the child has had little access with his mother. HELD: The child's primary residence should be with the mother. Based on the information before the Court, the mother has always been the primary caregiver of the child and remained at home with the child for the first year of his life. The mother was responsible for the child's day to day needs, health care and child care. As well the father asserts that he was involved in the child's health care needs but was unable to name the child's pediatrician. The father will have access to the child for three days when he is not working including overnight access. The father's gross annual income is $48,897 which results in a payment to the mother for child maintenance in the sum of $393.00 payable on the first day of each and every month until further ordered by the Court. In addition the father will responsible for 75% of the child care expenses.","HELD: The Court ordered interim custody of the child. The Court found that S.W.S. was the primary caregiver for the child and that C.J.S.'s needs were met by the primary caretaker, who was also an abusive man with an alcohol problem. The primary caregivant, who had been diagnosed as clinically depressed and addicted to alcohol, was unable to care for her child for the first year of his life and was incapable of caring for him as a result of the alleged attempt to commit suicide. She was to have access for the three days he was off work each week and was to maintain the child's health and well being for the rest of her life. The court found that the primary primary careant was the child, and the Court ordered that the child should have access every day of the week."
"The respondent was recruited by the respondents. Her job was to start quality assurance practice. She accepted an offer of employment, giving up her own company to do so. After 15 months she was dismissed. The trial judge in her action for wrongful dismissal and negligent misrepresentation did not find any negligent misrepresentation but awarded damages equivalent to five months notice for wrongful dismissal. The appellant appealed the dismissal of her claim for negligent misrepresentation and the notice period for her wrongful dismissal. The respondent cross-appealed the damage award, claiming the trial judge failed to take into account the appellant's failure to mitigate. Appeal and cross-appeal, that the evidence supports the trial judge's findings, and he did not make any errors in law.","The appellant appealed the dismissal of her claim for negligent misrepresentation and also the notice period for wrongful dismissal. The respondent cross-appealed claiming the five-month notice period should be reduced due to the appellant's failure to mitigate her loss.

"The Crown applied for an order forfeiting a vehicle pursuant to s.16(1) of the Controlled Drug and Substances Act. The registered owner applied for an order declaring her interest in the vehicle was not affected by any forfeiture order. The owner was passenger when 28.3 pounds of marijuana was discovered in the trunk of her Lincoln. She was found not guilty of trafficking and possession of marijuana for the purpose of trafficking. The driver was found guilty of possession for the purpose of trafficking. The trafficking charge against him was judicially stayed. HELD: An order of forfeiture issued pursuant to s.16(1). The application for relief was dismissed. 1)It was not necessary to address the Charter submissions with respect to s.19(3) because Crown counsel consented to the respondent's application being viewed as an application for relief from forfeiture under s.20. 2)It was impossible to conclude the respondent 'appeared innocent of any complicity' in the offence for which the driver was convicted and that she 'exercised all reasonable care to be satisfied' that the Lincoln was not likely to be used in the commission of the offence. 3)Section 11 of the Charter applies only when person has been charged with an offence. There was no charge against the respondent at this time. 4)The Act distinguishes between three types of persons who might own, or have an interest in, conveyance which is 'offence-related property': the interest of person convicted of the offence is forfeitable pursuant to s.16(1); if the person has been neither convicted nor charged and appears innocent of any complicity in the offence; someone charged with the offence which gave rise to the forfeiture application (as here). The forfeiture is not, except with respect to an offender, arbitrary. In view of the provisions available under the Act to obtain relief from forfeiture it cannot be concluded that empowering a court to grant an order of forfeiture constitutes cruel or unusual punishment.","The Crown applied pursuant to s. 16(1) of the Controlled Drug and Substances Act for an order forfeiting the Lincoln to Her Majesty in Right of Canada. Both individuals were charged with trafficking in marijuana and possession of marijuana for the purpose of trafficking. Both were found guilty of possession of the drug and judicially stayed the charges against them. The Crown sought an order declaring that her interest in the Lincoln was not affected by any forfeiture order. HELD: The Crown's application was dismissed and an order of forfeiture was issued. 1) The Court must be satisfied that the accused is innocent of any complicity in the designated substance offence and that she exercised all reasonable care to be satisfied the property was not likely to have been used in connection with the commission of that offence. 2) The court must be able to grant relief to those who have a reasonable interest in property forfeited pursuant to the Act. The Court is not obliged to grant this relief. 3) Section 16(3) provides the authority for the court to make an order pursuant to ss. 19(3), s. 20(4) and s. 12 of the Charter. Section 19(d) provides that the court can order forfeiture of property that is of interest to a person who has been convicted of a designated substance offense and who has not been a convicted or charged with the offence. 4) It is not necessary to address the Charter submissions with respect to s19(3). The Crown consented to the submission being viewed as an application by the accused being 'a person who was charged with an offence of trafficking'. 5) The Crown must satisfy the judge hearing the application that there is some evidence that she may have had knowledge of the existence of the marijuana in the trunk of the vehicle. The accused was found not guilty on both counts. 6) Section 20(3)(d) is an application for relief from forfeiture pursuant to S16(1). The Court has the authority to order the forfeiture of a vehicle that is used to transport controlled drugs and substances."
"The mother had custody of the 12 and year olds under the terms of the January 10, 2000 consent judgment. The father applied to vary child support in November on the basis of his reduced income. HELD: The application was dismissed with costs to the petitioner fixed at $1,000. The onus is on the applicant to provide cogent, independent or objective verification of change of circumstances. This application was brought 10 months after the pre-trial conference. It was of no consequence that someone may come into the home rather than using commercial day care service. There was no change in the father's hours of work or the schedule. The only change was that the mother was no longer available to provide care during Saturday of his access weekends. The mother was not to schedule activities during the father's access periods without his consent and he was to provide 7 days written notice if he chooses not to exercise access during specified times. This was not a variation of the custody/access regime but rather specific directions to provide some predictability for the children.","HELD: The application was dismissed with costs fixed in the amount of $1,000. The consent judgment provided that the petitioner was not to schedule activities for the children during the respondent's access periods without his consent. The respondent had custody of their two children, Rikki-Lee, age 12 and Lucas, age 7, under the terms of the consent judgment. The court found that there had not been any material change in the circumstances of the children as the petitioner's income was reduced and referred to his 1999 tax return indicating an income of $42,386.34. It did not constitute a variation of the custody/access regime but rather, specific directions with respect to execution of the access regime."
"The plaintiff sues the defendant town for water damage sustained to her former residence when frozen pipes burst. The plaintiff claims she told the Town Office to shut off her water supply and the failure to do so let to the damages being sustained. HELD: The claim is dismissed. 1) There is no evidence that the plaintiff gave clear instructions to the town to shut off her water. 2) The proximate cause of the damage was turning off the heat and power without ensuring that water line, toilets, and the water tank had been properly drained. 3) The plaintiff sustained no damages herself. She admits she negotiated the sale price of $50,000 with her daughter prior to any damage being sustained to the property. No adjustment had to be made to her daughter thereafter for any 'loss' occasioned. Any claim would have to be made by her daughter not her.","The plaintiff brought an action for water damage sustained to her former residence when frozen pipes burst. She alleged that she instructed the Town Office to shut off her water supply and the failure to do so led to the damages being sustained. The Town of Martensville disputes that such instructions were given and that, in any event, the cause of the pipes bursting was not as result of the water not being turned off, but rather because the plaintiff had the power and heat disconnected. HELD: The action was dismissed. The plaintiff's action could not succeed for the following reasons: 1)The plaintiff had no further standing, having legally divested title and not received any less value on the sale of the property in the process.  2)Any claim at this point would have to be made by her daughter, not her. The Court cannot find on the evidence that clear instructions are given by the plaintiff to the town to disconnect the water service. The evidence demonstrates a misunderstanding at best between what the plaintiff believed she was requesting and what in fact she did instruct. This cannot be construed as negligence in the circumstances by the town nor by the Town nor does the fact that the plaintiff was having her power disconnected make this action impossible. 3)The Court found that the action was unable to succeed because of the defendant's negligence."
"Fulltext of judgment follows: Following the conviction of the respondent on a charge of trafficking in morphine contrary to section 5(1) of the Controlled Drugs and Substances Act, the prosecutor asked the sentencing judge to make a DNA order under section 487.051(3) of the Criminal Code. The judge declined to do so for the reason this was the respondent's first drug offence and she had no record of violence. With respect, we are of the opinion the judge erred in declining to make the order. The error lay in the judge's failure to have regard for the offender's record as a wholeÃ¹she has 53 prior convictionsÃ¹and to have adequate regard for the objectives of section 487.051 as identified in R. v. Briggs 2001 CanLII 24113 (ON C.A.), (2001), 45 C.R. (5th) 99 (Ont. C.A.). In light of the nature of the respondent's current offence, her lengthy record, her history of recidivism, and the relatively modest impact an order would have on her privacy and security interests, we are satisfied an order should have been made. Accordingly, and in the best interests of the administration of justice, there will be an order under section 487.051(3) in Form 5.04 for the taking of bodily samples from the respondent. If any directions should be required in relation to the execution of the order, the parties are given leave to informally apply for such directions through the Registrar's office.","Following the conviction of the respondent on a charge of trafficking in morphine contrary to s. 5(1) of the Controlled Drugs and Substances Act, the prosecutor asked the sentencing judge to make a DNA order under s. 487.051(3) under the Criminal Code.

"In the evening, the accused inmate and his two co-accused inmates placed themselves in close proximity to the complainant inmate at table at the Penitentiary. The co-accused threw hot liquid from the cup directly into the complainant's face and the three inmates commenced stabbing the complainant with weapon. second complainant inmate attempted to intervene to assist the first complainant and the accused and co-accused began to stab the second complainant. The first complainant suffered severe first and second degree burns to his face and to his shoulders as well as numerous puncture wounds and lacerations but was not critically injured. The accused was charged with aggravated assault on the first complainant and common assault on the second complainant. None of the inmates testified at trial other than the accused. The accused testified that he felt he was being shunned in the Block and had received threats from the first complainant and others in the complainant's group who were brandishing shanks earlier that day. The defence argued that the Crown failed to prove that the injuries caused to the first complainant fell within the definition of 'wound, maim, disfigure or endanger life'; and that the acts done to the first and second complainants were in self-defence as contemplated by s. 34 of the Criminal Code. HELD: The accused was convicted of both counts. 1) In relation to the accused's defence of self-defence pursuant to s. 34(2) pertaining to the first complainant, the Court found the accused did not believe that he was being assaulted within the meaning of the law and, even if he did hold this belief, such a belief was not reasonable in the circumstances. Further, the Court did not accept, on a subjective or objective basis, that the accused reasonably believed that the first complainant had the present ability to carry out the threat, notwithstanding that the physical aspect of the assault need not be imminent or immediate. Lastly, the Court found that the accused did not believe that he had no other option. The accused admitted that he had other options but chose not to avail himself of them. 2) The Court found it did not need to assess the application of s. 37 of the Code in relation to the common assault charge. Rather, the Court found s. 27 of the Code applicable and determined that the second complainant was legally justified to use as much force as was reasonably necessary to prevent the commission of an offence which would be arrestable without warrant. The Court found the second complainant was clothed in legal justification and the accused was not entitled to the protection of s. 34(1) because the accused provoked the assault, and the force he used was more than necessary to defend himself as the accused was armed with a shank and the second complainant was not.","The accused was charged with aggravated assault and one count of common assault relating to a violent incident that took place in the maximum security unit of the prison. The accused and two alleged victims were inmates at the prison and were being held on 'B' Block, range designated for gang members. Given that the incident was captured by two security videos, there is no doubt as to what happened.. The issues raised by the accused pertain to how his actions ought to be characterized. HELD: The accused was found guilty of both counts. 1)The accused's actions against the victim were done in self-defence as contemplated by s. 34(2) of the Criminal Code. The Crown had established beyond a reasonable doubt that the accused and the two alleged victim were involved in a 'joint' assault within the meaning of s. 21(1)(b). 2)The Court reviewed the three elements of the accused’s defence and concluded that bodily harm to the victim was objectively foreseeable by him as a probable consequence to the plot to which he was a party. The Court reviewed whether the accused reasonably believed that the victim had been assaulted. 3)The Crown was entitled to call recognition evidence in accordance with the principles set out in R. v. Leaney, [1996]. S.C.R. 321 (Alta. C.A.])."
"The applicant applied for judicial interim release under s. 20(b) of the Extradition Act and s. 679 of the Criminal Code. Romania sought extradition of the applicant so that he might serve a 3 year prison sentence imposed as a result of a conviction in Romania for criminally negligent homicide with respect to a motor vehicle collision where the accused, while impaired, hit a pedestrian and killed him. The applicant offered surety from the Romania community in Saskatchewan who did not appear to have known the accused for long and offered to put up his car as bond. The applicant had common law spouse in Saskatchewan but owned no real property. HELD: Although the Crown conceded that the applicant had met the relatively low threshold of showing that his application for leave to appeal his extradition order was not frivolous, the Court of Appeal declined to release the applicant. The Court of Appeal held that there is an elevated risk of flight in light of the fact that the applicant has exhausted all appeals in Romania and is facing a 3 year prison sentence. Canada's international obligations in extradition proceedings require the Court to look more severely at the risk of non-appearance than it would if the application was made solely under s. 679 in respect of criminal proceeding in Canada. The sureties offered by the applicant were not sufficient to ensure his attendance at Court. The application for judicial interim release was dismissed.","HELD: The application was dismissed. The applicant was granted judicial interim release pursuant to s. 20(b) of the Extradition Act and s. 679 of the Criminal Code. The factual background to this application is as follows: The applicant is a Roma and Romanian national who has resided in Canada since his arrival here exactly eight years ago.. The applicant seeks his extradition from Canada so that he might serve a three-year prison sentence imposed as a result of his conviction, in that country, for criminally negligent homicide (an offence equivalent to that of manslaughter in Canada). The applicant has no real property and Romania views the potential forfeiture of his personal vehicle as being of little assurance that he will surrender himself into custody pending the Minister's decision on his surrender to Romania.  1) The applicant's status as a Convention refugee and Canada's non-refoulement obligations do not displace the well-established requirement that a court considering an application for judicial interim released in an extradition proceeding must limit the assumption of risk of non-appearance more severely than the Court would do in an application by an offender made directly under s. 7 of the Code.  2) The application for interim release is dismissed.  3) Romania's submissions as to the deficiencies in the nature and extent of the sureties proffered by the applicant are compelling and the Court has concluded that the risk is such that it cannot be sufficiently mitigated by release conditions which, on the materials before it, he might be able to meet.  4) There is no reason to consider the third test under s679(3)(c)."
"Civil Procedure Injunction HELD: The first portion of the statement of claim is an attempt by the plaintiff to have the Court take jurisdiction over a matter that is already before the Saskatchewan Human Rights Tribunal. While the court has jurisdiction to hear human rights complaints, the jurisdiction only arises after the tribunal process has been exhausted. Since the tribunal procedure has not been completed, the portions of the statement of claim dealing with the human rights complaint are stayed on the basis that the underlying issues may only be heard by the court upon application of the Chief Commissioner of the Saskatchewan Human Rights Code pursuant to s. 29.6 of the Code. With respect to the claim that the defendant breached The Animal Protection Act, the essence of the claim is to seek damages against the plaintiff for the loss of the service dog. That portion of the claim must be struck because the plaintiffs cannot circumvent the provisions of The Animal Protection Act, 1999 nor eliminate the defendant’s right to be charged and tried in Provincial Court through the expediency of claiming a declaration in a civil suit. The third claim is that the defendant was negligent in allowing other children to interact with the service dog will not be struck because, assuming the facts in the pleadings are true, the claim for damages is viable. Likewise, the fourth claim that the defendant intentionally inflicted mental and emotional suffering on the autistic plaintiff will not be struck as is not plain and obvious from the pleadings that the claim cannot succeed. The plaintiffs’ application for an interlocutory injunction was dismissed because the claims that have not been struck are not rationally connected to the injunction, even assuming the remaining claims present a serious issue to be tried they do not justify a finding that the plaintiffs will suffer irreparable harm if the injunction is refused and the balance of convenience weighs in favour of not granting an injunction.","HELD: The Court dismissed both applications. The Court found that the plaintiffs had not succeeded in their application for an interlocutory injunction, and that the Court had failed to provide sufficient evidence to support its decision. The court found that s. 23 of The Saskatchewan Human Rights Code gives it an exclusive and unfettered authority to address the needs of its citizens."
"HELD: The court found the following with respect to each issue: 1) the grandmother was a person of sufficient interest regarding the children pursuant to s. 6 of The Children’s Law Act, 1997 and had standing to bring her application for custody; 2) it would be in the best interests of the children, now aged ten and nine years of age, to have their primary residence with their grandmother as she was their psychological parent. They had resided with their grandmother for most of their lives and it was important to maintain their relationships with their school and friends. The respondent would have regular weekly parenting time with the children; and 3) the evidence was inadequate to consider child support.","The third party in this matter is the maternal grandmother who is making an application for joint custody of the two children. HELD: There is an interim order designating the grandmother as a person of sufficient interest. This designation was made pursuant to s. 6 of The Children’s Law Act, 1997, s. 1997, c.8.2. The grandmother was the primary caretaker of the children for 18 years. Prior to this, the father was granted supervised access to the children every second weekend for seven years. The mother was granted interim custody in August 2015. The father is to move the children from primary care of the grandmother to his primary care. There is no evidence that the grandmother is a person with sufficient interest regarding the children. There are photos of the father with the children in the summer of 2011, the spring and summer of 2012 and the fall of 2013. The grandparents lived with the grandmother for the past seven years and have resided with her for the last four years. They have two children, aged 10 and 9 years.. The grandmother is the primary caregiver for the children and is the grandmother of the parties’ oldest child, Arty, who was born in January 2015. She was the biological mother of both children. The parties had been in a relationship for 25 years and the grandmother resided in the common-law residence with the father. The relationship between the grandmother and the father had deteriorated over the past few years and she was unable to bring this matter back to court requesting continuation of his access visits. The court reviewed the extensive affidavit material filed by counsel on behalf of both parties and found no difficulty in determining the grandmother was a person sufficient interest in the children as her access visits were sporadic prior to the mother moving out of the home and into her new home. There were no issues with respect to the grandmother having access with her children."
