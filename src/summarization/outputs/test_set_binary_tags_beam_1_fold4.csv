3_2003skqb93.txt,"The company applied for an order granting court approval of a proposal made by its creditor pursuant to Part III of the Bankruptcy and Insolvency Act. A former 28-year employee objected on the grounds pension plan members should be treated as a different class of creditor rather than under the unsecured creditor classification ascribed to them by the proposal; the indemnification of past directors under the terms of the proposal was inappropriately wide. He submitted the unfunded pension liabilities constitute trust funds pursuant to provincial pension legislation (the Pension Benefits Act s.43(3)) and as such the pension fund claimants are entitled to preferred or secured creditor status. HELD: The Proposal was accepted.  1)Provincially created statutory trusts such as the one created by the Pensions Benefits Act are not recognized in bankruptcy including Proposals submitted under the BIA. The Trustee and the company acted appropriately in identifying the nature and status of the pensioners' claims. Although it might have reflected the status of his claim against the employer outside the BIA, the specific objection did not constitute a valid ground of legal objection to the Proposal. 2)The Proposal met the statutory and judicial criteria for acceptance by the Court. The Court takes into account the interests of the debtor, general body of creditors and the public at large in maintaining the integrity of the bankruptcy legislation. Of the 15 employees in the same position, 12 voted in favour of the proposal, 2 failed to file proofs of their claims; 89 percent of all creditors voted in favour of acceptance.  3)Each party was to assume their own costs of the hearing.","The applicant company applied for an order granting court approval of a proposal made by it to its creditor (the 'W.R.T. Proposal'), pursuant to Part III of Division I of the Bankruptcy and Insolvency Act. The applicant company and the Trustee accepted that the terms of the indemnity set out in the Proposal with respect to present and past officers and directors was too widely cast and inappropriate. The Trustee, which represents a former 28 year employee, accepted that its pension plan members should be treated as a different class of creditor than the unsecured creditors who had been represented by the proposal. At the December meeting of creditors, approximately 93 percent of the creditors who identified as creditors who supported the applicant's proposal voted in favour of acceptance. The February meeting of the Trustees was adjourned to allow certain questions raised by the creditors to be further investigated and to permit examination of the director. At that meeting of all creditors, 89 percent of them voted in favor of the proposal. The trustee made an application to the Registrar in Bankrupty for court approval. Notice of Objection to the application was filed on behalf of an unsecunded creditor. The trustee was appointed by the Company to act as trustee and submitted the pro proposal as set out on his behalf. The proposed amended para. 9.1 of the W.R.'T. proposal was consistent with the provisions of ss. 50(13) of the Act and ss.50(13). The Trustees voted in the favour of the applicant and 2 opposed it. The Public-at-Large in maintaining the integrity of bankruptcy legislation favored the applicant. Taking into account all of these interests the Court concluded that the proposed amended proposal did meet the statutory and judicial criteria for acceptance by the Court. Accordingly the Pro proposal is accepted and the draft order filed may issue including the amendment to para. 8.1. The Court ordered the amendment of the proposals as set forth in the revised para. of the draft orders filed upon this application pursuant to Rule 92 of the BIA. The court reviewed the interests the trustee had raised and the submissions made by the applicants at the hearing of this application. Taking the interests and the applicant company's position in bankruptcy pursuant to the Act, the Court authorized the amendment. The Chief Executive Officer (CEO) had been appointed by him to act in the TrustEE's role as trustee. The CEO's position was that the unfunded pension liabilities constituted trust funds pursuant to provincial pensions legislation"

The trial judge concluded on the evidence that the blood alcohol level at the time of the offence was different from the time of the offence, and found that the Crown could not rely on the presumption of identity. He ruled, however, that they could rely on the presumption of accuracy, and placed an onus on the appellant to raise a reasonable doubt on the whole of the evidence. The appellant appealed. Allowing the appeal and ordering a new trial, that the trial judge committed a fundamental error of law by ruling that when the Crown is forced to rely on the balance of the evidence, the accused must raise a reasonable doubt, a burden that clearly remains on the Crown.","This was an application for leave to appeal from a decision in the Supreme Court of Canada dismissing an appeal from the appellant's conviction under s. 253(b) of the Criminal Code. The Crown adduced breathalyzer readings of 110 and 120 milligrams. The expert was asked to relate the readings shown by the tests to the alcohol consumed by the appellant. He stated that the readings were not consistent with the evidence of consumption given by the accused. The trial judge concluded that the appellant had not raised a reasonable doubt on the whole of the evidence. Allowing the appeal and ordering a new trial, that the Crown is entitled to rely on the presumption of accuracy."
c_2009skpc31.txt,"The accused, Chisum Log Homes and its sole director Gary Varga, are charged with operating a processing facility without a licence contrary to s. 18.1(1) of The Forest Resources Management Act. The accused corporation assembles log home packages. The packages are sold to customers across Canada. The accused corporation buys wood from area operators such as L&amp;M to be used in its packages. L&amp;M through its contractor P&amp;E, harvest wood from the forest and sell the wood to pulp mills, saw mills and other customers such as the accused. These area operators and their contractors have Forest Management Agreements and Forest Product Processing Facility Licences. In August and September 2007, the area operator L&amp;M delivered logs to the accused. The accused took additional steps to prepare the logs for inclusion in their log home packages which they sold. The accused does not have a Forest Product Processing Facility Licence. The issue in this case is whether the Crown has shown that the accused requires such a licence. HELD: 1) The definition of 'manufacture' in the Act is extremely broad as it says, 'means any step taken'. Given this definition is not difficult to find based on the evidence presented that the steps taken by the contractor in cutting the logs is more than simply harvesting as it is defined in the legislation. See R. v. Provincial Forest Products, 2000 SKQB 371. 2) The Court is satisfied that the accused corporation, Chisum, took steps to manufacture the forest product for the log home market. Steps such as debarking were steps taken in the manufacture of a forest product for market.  3) Given the wide definition it is the Court's view that many facilities, including a retail lumberyard, could be captured within the definition. Given the stated purpose of the Act, it is appropriate that the requirement for a Processing Facility Licence be restricted so that it does not apply to every entity that manufactures a forest product. 4) The processes Chisum is involved in encompass the substantial conversion of the forest product into logs to be used in the log home industry. The process is not insignificant, nor is it a process which is removed from the sustainable use of forest lands and the need to maintain and enhance the health of forest lands. The Court concludes that Chisum was required to have a Processing Facility Licence. 5) Pursuant to s. 81 of the Act, Gary Varga, as President of Chisum, is also guilty of violating s. 18.1 of the Act.","The defendant, Chisum Log Homes and Lumber Ltd., was charged with operating a processing facility without a licence contrary to s. 18.1(1) of The Forest Resources Management Act, F-19.1. The defendant was the President and sole Director of Chisums. The company assembles log home packages in the Weyakwin district north of Prince Albert. These packages are sold to customers across Canada and around the world. The defendants suggest that once forest product is harvested and the dues and fees paid, they are no longer forest products and are thus no longer governed by provincial legislation. HELD: The defendant is guilty of operating a material processing facility (FPF) without a license contrary to the Forest Resources management Act, f-19(1). The evidence was tendered by agreement. The court found that the process used by Chisuma is more than simply harvesting as it is defined in the legislation. The creation of a chisum log is processing and must require a processing licence. The process detailed in P-1 encompassed the substantial conversion of the forest product into logs to be used in the log home industry. The application of the FPF to the defendant was not a matter of law but of fact."
d_2001nssc85.txt,"The applicant was aware that allegations of abuse had been made against him in an alternative dispute resolution process undertaken by the Province with respect to his former employment. He applied under the Freedom of Information and Protection of Privacy Act for certain information concerning these allegations. The FOIPOP Privacy Coordinator denied access and the applicant appealed. Appeal allowed; in all cases where the claimants had signed release forms the applicant is to be supplied with information as to the number and nature of allegations made against him and the names of the complainants; the specific dates and times of all allegations made against him; the evidence collected in relation to the investigations undertaken as a result of the allegations; the number and dollar amount of payouts made for actions attributable only to the applicant; and information as to whether any of the allegations leveled were dismissed or unproven. The appeal should proceed as an appeal de novo. The applicant was not seeking information from R.C.M.P. files and the release of information which the police had passed on to the Department of Justice would not harm law enforcement as the information was compiled by the Province for its own purposes. The complainants had been required to execute releases whereby the information supplied could be used for various specified purposes, all of which potentially involved public disclosure or disclosure to the applicant. Law enforcement protection was lost when a release was obtained from the complainants and the information was passed to the Province. There was no unreasonable invasion of the claimants' privacy. The applicant was entitled to know what he had been accused of and should have the right to correct the record.","The appellant was unsuccessful in obtaining information pursuant to the Freedom of Information and Protection of Privacy Act. The information was requested in an expeditious fashion. The appellant appealed the denial of access. He argued that the disclosure would hinder the investigation of institutional abuse and that offering compensation would potentially hinder the public's understanding of the process. He also argued that there were a number of errors in the Act which would impede the investigation. The administration of the Act was also not aware of the errors. The application was also unsuccessful in blocking access to the information requested. Throughout the course of the trial, the appellant was given information about a number that had been made public, including the extent of the abuse, the type and frequency of the alleged abuse, and the identity of those accused. The transcript of the sentencing hearing was also refused. The appeal was dismissed. The degree to which the various roles of the Department of Justice, the Departmentof Justice, and Public Safety became meshed and interchangeable was clearly set forth in paras. 11-33 of the affidavit of the Justice Minister. The portions of the transcript of sentencing hearing were also refused as requested. The denial of the information was grounds for an inquiry into the extent to which public officials were required to participate in the sentencing hearings. As the transcript was not evidence of the actual sentencing hearing, it was not necessary to infer that the transcript could not be obtained from the sentencing proceedings."
b_2013skqb407.txt,"HELD: The Court held that the cause of the damage was high humidity in the building caused by water leaking into it from the roof. The failure of the tenant to maintain the floor caused approximately 25 percent of the damage to the floor. The estimated span for the flooring was 20 years. As the lease was in good standing at present and would expire in 2018, the age of the floor at that time would be 17 years. The Court awarded to the landlord the amount of $836, which was 25 percent of 3/20 of the damages claimed. The business loss claimed by the tenant was $4,800. Thus the net setoff owing by the landlord to the tenant was $4,800 less $836. The defendant tenant was awarded costs of the three-day trial of $2,500.","The tenant sued the landlord for damages alleging negligence by failing to clean, wax and polish the vinyl tile floor in the building, thereby permitting moisture to penetrate between and underneath the tiles resulting in lifting and cracking. The landlord sold the building to the tenant at the time of the lease, retaining the exclusive use of a portion of the basement under the lease. The tenant opened a restaurant for $168,000 in 2008 and spent seven years renovating and cleaning the building. The building suffered water damage in two areas resulting in the closure of the restaurant and a number of customers having to close their restaurant for several days. The ceiling tiles in the restaurant had been stripped, polished and painted five times in excess of standard reading for normal building material and were not properly maintained. The damage to the floor was $22,281 and the tenant was contributorily negligent to the extent of 25% of the damage. The tenants sued for economic interference alleging the landlord interfered with the sale of the building and sought damages for economic damage. HELD: The tenant was awarded judgment in the amount of $6,464 plus $2,500 in lieu of taxable costs. The court accepted that the tenant is contributorily responsible to the amount at the end of the 25 year lease. Leaking of water through the ceiling onto the floor did necessitate closure of a restaurant, causing a reduction of customers who could reasonably be expected to be put off by the unsightly ceiling and floor tiles, and deterioration of the vinyl floor tiles could be attributed to poor maintenance lack of sufficient polish and waxing. The evidence does show that a part, but only a part of the moisture entering into the subfloor was due to the negligence of the tenant in failing to properly maintain the floor. The plaintiff is entitled to judgment against the landlord in the sum of $3,964 for economic harm."
6_2003skqb3.txt,"The applicant sought a declaration that the charges against her could not constitute professional misconduct without contravening the Charter and Saskatchewan Human Rights Code; an order of prohibition to prevent the SAPLN discipline committee or Association from hearing the charges; a declaration that the charges are res judicata; an order for particulars; costs. HELD: The application was dismissed in its entirety with taxed costs to SAPLN.  1)No order for further particulars was made at this time. The Hearing Notice particularizes the factual allegations and is specific as to time and their nature. 2)The only matter previously considered by the discipline committee dealt with whether there was any professional misconduct established arising out of criminal convictions for illegal picketing prior to the applicant becoming a member of SALPN. 3)The Act provides an adequate alternate remedy, which should be pursued. There were no special circumstances upon which the court could exercise its discretion to determine the merits of this application or to provide the relief sought.","The applicant seeks an order declaring the charges cannot be professional misconduct without contravening provisions of The Saskatchewan Charter and The Saskatchewan Human Rights Code and an order of prohibition to prohibit the discipline committee from hearing the charges. HELD: 1) The applicant is a member of the Association and is charged with professional misconduct contrary to s. 24 of The Licensed Practical Nurses Act. 2) The facts are alleged to support the conclusion that the applicant is guilty of professional misconduct. 3) The application for a writ of prohibition from proceeding with the hearing of the charges is denied. 4) The court must not entertain an application where there is a convenient alternative remedy available. The procedure on appeal, the composition of the senate committee, its powers and the manner in which they were exercised are probably to be exercised by a body which was not a professional court of appeal and was not bound to act exactly as one nor likely to do so. 5) The Court must not be limited in its application of the doctrine of the 'adequate alternative remedy' as a bar to judicial review. The Act provides an elaborate complaints investigation and discipline process, with access to the courts through rights of appeal for the member being disciplined. The statements referred to are incorrect and he knew or should have known them to be incorrect. He displayed these statements while he was picketing Planned Parenthood. He took photographs of aborted fetuses and showed them to patients and potential patients. He also displayed these pictures of aborted fetus. These facts supported the conclusion the applicant was guilty of Professional misconduct. The Court would therefore seek a writ or order for particulars, costs and filing of an application for an order for a hearing."

HELD: On a review of all material filed, the Court concluded that it was not possible to resolve the matter summarily. The Court directed a trial of the issues between the parties.","FIAT. The applicant applied for an order varying the support provisions of a 1989 judgment. He sought an order requiring a total payment of $570.75 per month for both children. The wife had recently obtained full time employment and was unable to participate in any activities with her new employment. An agreement was reached in 1989 in accordance with paragraph 2(c) of the 1989 judgment reducing maintenance from $1,200 per month to $500 per month.

b_2000skqb420.txt,"FIAT. An application for summary judgment under Part Forty. In issue was whether a solicitor is bound by an undertaking to protect an expert witness for its professional fees. The defendant solicitor, who represented several farmers and farming companies in suits brought against Saskatchewan Crop Insurance Corporation on a contingency fee basis, confirmed in writing in 1993 that his office would undertake to protect the plaintiff consultants for their fees and disbursements and to pay interest at a rate of 12% per annum. The plaintiff was hired to provide technical evidence as to crop losses and damages the farmers claimed as a result of actions of SCIC. When all of the claims were dismissed at trial, the solicitor rejected the plaintiff's demand for payment arguing he had no obligation to pay as the farmers' actions had not resulted in the recovery of any monies. The plaintiff sued the solicitor in 1997 for professional fees of $37,604.33. The plaintiff objected to certain portions of the defendant's affidavit. HELD: The plaintiff was awarded $37,604.33 plus interest at 12% per annum as provided for in the undertaking, and costs of the action.  1)The plaintiff commenced its action under the general rules but amended its claim without objection to continue under the Simplified Procedure. 2)Portions of the defendant's affidavit were struck as being hearsay and opinion or related to matters immaterial to the proceeding.  3)The applicant's admissions at discovery did not confirm the interpretation of the undertaking set out in the statement of defence. It was obvious the plaintiff's officer recognized the farmers were intending to fund their costs from a settlement or judgment and that disbursements, including the costs of any expert's reports commissioned by them or the defendant, would be paid by his clients regardless of the outcome of the suits. 4)The only conclusion that could be drawn was that defendant guaranteed payment of the applicant's account regardless of the outcome of their mutual client's actions. A solicitor is presumed to know the cannons of the Law Society including c.XVI, comm.10 of the Code of Professional Conduct with respect to undertakings. The solicitor's undertaking in 1993 was absolutely clear. The addition of the word 'protect' put the question beyond doubt. His inquiry in 1997 made it clear the defendant recognized his responsibility and was hoping for some resolution of the applicant's account.","FIAT. The plaintiff was hired to provide technical evidence as to crop losses and damages the plaintiffs claimed resulted from the actions of the defendant. The defendant was employed by the farmers on contingency basis to prepare their reports. The plaintiffs' action did not settle. They proceeded, finally, to trial and dismissed all of the claims. The court held that a solicitor bound by an undertaking to protect an expert witness for its professional fees would receive interest at a rate of 12% per annum. The portions of the affidavit that were not evidence were not used as evidence but rather relate to matters immaterial to the proceeding. The judge found that the respondent guaranteed the payment of the plaintiff's account regardless of the outcome of the mutual client's actions. The only conclusion that could be drawn from the facts was that the Respondent guaranteed the Payment of the applicant's account irrespective of the outcomes of their mutual client’s actions."

Finding the defendant solely at fault, that evidence from the accident reconstruction as to the angle of impact supported a conclusion the defendant was travelling faster than she realized and was inattentive. Damages were set as follows: impairment to hearing in left ear assessed at $8500, damage to left knee assessed at $2500. Exacerbation of a pre-existing back condition which produced consequences in the severe range was assessed at $31,500.","The plaintiff suffered a concussion, hearing loss, neck injury and a knee injury when he was hit by a vehicle driven by the defendant. The second plaintiff suffered neck stiffness and a minor hand injury when his vehicle crested a hill and came into view. He was taken to hospital by ambulance to hospital. The third plaintiff suffered serious neck stiffness, hearing damage and a broken ankle. He underwent further surgery for his injuries. The medical evidence showed he had been travelling at a high rate of speed (55 to 60 km/h) for the past 3 years. The court considered the angle of impact at which the defendant vehicle came into contact with the plaintiff vehicle and concluded that the collision occurred at about 125 to 130 meters from the intersection. The Court concluded that both parties were responsible for the accident. The plaintiff's inattention, coupled with a probable higher rate of rate of Speed than she estimates, rendered her solely responsible for this accident and she was not justified in entering the lane of opposing traffic."

During his employment as professional truck driver, the accused had driven into construction zone on highway and hit another vehicle that had been stopped. The three teenage occupants of the vehicle were killed and flag person was severely injured as result of the collision. The accused was sure that he had not been asleep at the time of the accident but felt that he had not been paying attention. He had not noticed any of the signs posted at 100-metre intervals after the start of the construction zone 1.6 km south of the accident. The accused was 41 years of age. He had obtained his A-1 driver’s licence in 2009 and had clean driving abstract. He was married and had three children. He had recently been diagnosed with mild sleep apnea. He expressed remorse to the victim’s families and suffered from post-traumatic stress disorder.| HELD: The accused was sentenced to three years in imprisonment on the first count and three years concurrent for the second and third counts, and one year concurrent to the other counts on the fourth count. He was prohibited from operating a motor vehicle for five years and from possessing a firearm for 10 years after his release from imprisonment. The aggravating factors in the case were that the accused’s inattentiveness caused the death of three people and severely injured another person. The impact of the children’s deaths was devastating on their families. The accused was a professional driver and capable of exercising more skill and vigilance, especially when he was operating a semi-trailer truck in a construction zone. The mitigating factors were that the accused pled guilty and expressed profound remorse. He had not been drinking and had a clear driving record. The accused was at low risk to re-offend.","The accused was charged with three counts of dangerous driving, one of which was driving a motor vehicle that struck the victim of a construction accident. The victim was a young flag person standing near the vehicle when the collision occurred. The accused had been operating a semi unit when the vehicle struck the vehicle. The driver had been charged with operating a motor Vehicle in a manner that was dangerous to the public and thereby caused the death of the flag person. The defence had objected to the accused's use of drugs and alcohol. The Court sentenced the accused to six years imprisonment, plus a 10 year driving prohibition, a nine year prohibition order and a secondary DNA order were all set aside. The sentences were to be consecutive to each other, with the exception of the 10 year driver prohibition which was to be imposed after the sentencing hearing. The offences were determined to be the result of the accused’s inattention to detail in his victim impact statements. The defendant’ s. 718.2 Criminal Code offence was causing death and causing bodily harm. The impact on the three young men was so severe that they were knocked unconscious. The effects on the driver were severe. The injuries to the three other individuals were severe and the effects of the collision on the defendant”s family and friends. The court was satisfied that the accused had not only been in the construction zone but also had driven through it himself. The evidence showed that the defendant had been in regular operating mode for the past two years and that his actions were inattentive to the victims”. The collision was fatal and the defendant was sentenced to six-and-a-half years imprisonment. The aggravating and mitigating factors as outlined in s.718.1 of the Criminal Code were used to determine the appropriate sentence. The offender was found guilty of operating a vehicle in a fashion that was in harmony with the principles of sentencing contained within the Criminal code. The principles of sentence, along with the impairment of mental health and the need to denounce those who commit these offences, were to provide a vehicle for rehabilitation and to assist the public with recovery.

The plaintiff discovered that one of the defendants had shares being held at the defendants' solicitor's office and instructions were given to the sheriff to seize and sell the shares. The sheriff attended to seize the shares but the defendants' lawyer objected. At issue was whether the legal office could refuse to hand over the shares to the sheriff pursuant to a solicitor's lien and whether the shares were exempt from seizure pursuant to the Saskatchewan Farm Security Act. HELD: The law firm was ordered to produce and deliver to the sheriff the shares of the defendant in the third corporation; costs were fixed at $750. 1) The right of the law office to refuse to produce and deliver the shares to the sheriff had not been made out and court process was thwarted. There was no evidence to determine the amount owing from the defendant or the third corporation for legal work; a valid solicitor's lien was not demonstrated. 2) There is a difference between the seizure and sale of shares in a company and the seizure and sale of a piece of farmland and the argument that the Executions Act or the Saskatchewan Farm Security Act restricts the seizure fails.,"FIAT: The applicant seeks an order from the court requiring the legal office of the Judicial Centre to produce to the sheriff of Prince Albert, the shares owned by the respondent company's president pursuant to the June 5, 2001 writ of execution. The president's shares are part of the records of the company and as such they are subject to a solicitor's lien for legal work done for the company. The shares in the company are outstanding and subject to the solicitor's Lien. HELD: 1) The solicitor's obligation arises out of s. 66(3) of The Legal Profession Act and the Saskatchewan Farm Security Act. 2) The sheriff has the power to seize shares pursuant to The Executions Act. Upon seizure, the president has the right to sell the shares in order to collect the outstanding debt. 3) The court found that the end result of the seizure and sale of the shares will be sale of farm lands. That leave of the court must be obtained before the court can refuse to grant the shares to the receiver. 4) Given the totality of what is before the Court, the claim for lien is not made out. 5) The shares are exempt from seizure pursuant to S. 8 of The Saskatchewan Farm security Act. 6) The Sheriff has the authority to seize the shares pursuant the Executions act. 7) The Court found that s. 21(1) of the Saskatchewan farm security act has application. The s. 7 lien entitling the applicant to keep his or her property in possession and to transport it to another party for the purpose of doing justice to other persons besides their respective clients, is not a lien at common law. The applicant has no better right to retain documents than his client would have if he was bound to produce documents to him. 8) The claim for a lian is not properly made out in this case. The claim is not allowed to determine the amount owing by the applicant for legal services done for it. 9) The applicant's affidavit does not allow the court to determine what amount owing him. 10) Given all the evidence before the judge, the general rule that a solicitor’s lien can be raised against all persons claiming through the client must be qualified by consideration of whom the rights accruing from the lien are claimed. 11) The application to compel the sheriff to pay costs to the applicant is dismissed.  12) The portion of the writ issued by the sheriff that the sheriff could not enforce was $750."
c_2002nssc30.txt,"The borrower in a mortgage foreclosure action counterclaimed against the lender and joined the insurer of the mortgage and experts he had retained for advice in the development on the basis of negligent misrepresentation. During discovery of the borrower's former solicitor it was revealed that the solicitor may have given the borrower a warning that the financing arranged was inadequate. No privilege was claimed during the discovery process. The defendant brought an application for production of the solicitor's files and a copy of the borrower's employer and bank records intended to show his familiarity with business and financial affairs. Application allowed in part; solicitor's files with respect to terms of solicitor's retainer and non-legal advice or services are to be produced; employer's and banker's records not to be produced. The claim of negligent misrepresentation raised the question of reliance; evidence of knowledge would go to the borrower's state of mind and the solicitor's warning, if timely, would be relevant. The conduct of the borrower's present counsel in making no objection at the discovery amounted to waiver. There were no special circumstances existing with respect to the employer's and bank's records; the applicant made no effort to obtain the records until too late and the documents would have little, if any, relevance.","The plaintiff was a party to a mortgage foreclosure commenced against the defendants.

The defendant refused to honour the agreement and made a further discovery. The discovery was discontinued due to lack of time. The applicant applied to have the documents admitted into the discovery, and for an order requiring them to provide the documents requested, and all of the plaintiff's evidence excluded on the basis that it is subject to solicitor-client privilege. The application was dismissed.HELD: The application could not be dismissed. The court found that the plaintiff had waived his right to rely upon the representations of the defendants as he had been intimately involved in the planning and financing of the construction of this complex. There was no exceptional circumstance which would justify excluding the documents. The documents sought were found to be of sufficient relevance to the plaintiff that they could be of assistance to the cause of action."

HELD: The chamber's judge was in error in striking out portions of the statement of defence and counter-claim. The error consists of a failure to address the merits of the application. The Court of Appeal opted to deal with the merits of the application themselves, rather than remitting the matter back to Queen's Bench. While the allegation of fraud might have been pleaded more explicitly, the pleading is nevertheless sufficient to answer the requirements of QB Rule 173. The appellants should have been given an opportunity to amend their pleadings. The appeal was allowed and the application to strike was dismissed without prejudice to respondent's right to seek further particulars.","The chambers judge struck major portions of the statement of defence and counterclaim, striking portions of them in an error. The error consisted of a failure to address the merits of the application brought by the applicant, to address whether the impugned allegations met the requirements of Queen's Bench Rules, particularly in relation to the allegations of fraud. As for the requirements for Queen'sBench Rule 173 and Queen's Court Rules, the pleading was sufficient to answer to the requirements. As well, the allegations against fraud were sufficient to satisfy the requirements in Rule 173. The application was dismissed without order for costs in favour of the applicant."

The appellant's loss consisted of its inability to continue to obtain Mato products and sell them to its customers at a profit.

The requested relief cannot be granted unless the court has authority to order that a subdivision of land be effected outside the requirements of The Planning and Development Act. HELD: 1) Even if this was a proper case for the making of a vesting order, there is a further difficulty presented by the fact that the applicant school division is asking the court to order that a subdivision be effected, as a pre-condition to the vesting order. Whether under the former legislation or the present, the court is not free to subvert the statutory requirements in the exercise of its authority to make vesting orders. The court reviewed the relevant caselaw. 2) While the court is precluded from directing the Registrar to effect a subdivision that is prohibited by the legislation, a resolution of the matter could be achieved if, for example, after adjudicating on all the rights and obligations at issue, the Court was prepared to direct that the pre-conditions to subdivision approval be met by a party to the proceedings. Once the proposed subdivision meets the required standards and is approved, then a vesting order can be made in the appropriate circumstances under the provisions of s. 6.5 of The Land Titles Conversion Facilitation Regulations, or under The Improvements Under Mistake of Title Act. The court reviewed the applicable caselaw. 3) The court requested that further written submissions be provided by the parties on the matter of directing a trial of the issues.","The applicant school division asks for a vesting order regarding a presently unsubdivided parcel of land owned by the respondent. The applicant asks that the court has authority to order a subdivision of land outside the requirements of the Planning and Development Act. The respondent argues that the provisions of an agreement must, of necessity, be considered merged in conveyance. The application for a restraining order arises from an issue in the School Division's predecessor (the Kerrobert School Division) which had purchased land from the respondent, in the belief it was selling an existing parcel of property. The property that the respondent believed it was being sold to the applicant never legally existed as a separate parcel, and was in fact located within a quarter section owned by one of the respondent's relatives. The appellant argues that he is a bona fide purchaser with no notice of the Flads' interest and relies on the indefeasibility of his title. HELD: The appeal is allowed. The matter is directed to the trial of an issue and the court is not free to subvert the statutory requirements in the exercise of its authority to make vesting orders. 1) The respondent's application for an order directing the Registrar of Titles to register the Plan of Proposed Subdivision with respect to Parcel D is successful. 2) The applicant School Division is asking the court to order subdivision of Parcel G as a precondition to the vesting of the order.  3) The original transaction between the School division and the Flad was not concluded in an effort to avoid compliance with subdivision regulations, rather it was made in the mistaken belief that an already subdivided parcel was being transferred. The confusion was shared by the church and the administration. 4) The School Division advised that in seven years nothing has been resolved, prompting them to make this application. The Court is not entitled to directing the Court to make a vestencing order but is obliged to do so in the circumstances of this case."

Since the defendant was an uninsured motorist, the Facility Association defended the plaintiff's action against him; however, the plaintiff also brought an action against the insurer of a motor vehicle policy under which the deceased was insured. At issue was whether the Section D provisions of the deceased's insurance policy extended to cover the plaintiff. The deceased's insurance policy does not provide coverage to the plaintiff as the emotional harm suffered by her was simply too remote from the obligations contemplated by the contracting parties.","The plaintiff was killed when her cousin was struck from behind by a vehicle. She commenced this action to recover damages for nervous shock from the defendant. The defendant was an uninsured motorist at the time of the accident. She was present although she did not suffer any physical injuries and was not directly involved. She proceeded to advance a claim for nervous shocks as a result of the injurious act of the defendant who was an insured person under the policy. The plaintiff did not participate in the trial, the Facility Association and the defendant insurer settled her claim. The Court concluded that such was not the result.

b_2011nsca39.txt,"The police responded to a call from a woman identified as the defendant's girlfriend's mother to the effect that her daughter was being abused. Initially unable to locate the residence, they spoke to the girlfriend on the phone, who advised them that she was fine and did not require the police. They nevertheless continued to the residence, where they heard a scream from inside. Knowing that the defendant was a suspected drug dealer and potentially violent, they demanded entry into the home. The daughter opened the door and told them everything was fine, there had been no assault and she had simply wanted a ride home. From where they entered, the officers could see a person lying down in the bedroom. They approached the man, searched him for officer safety and then conducted a warrantless search to locate any other occupants. During the search, certain items were noted that caused them to obtain a search warrant, following which drugs were found. The defendant's argument that the search was illegal was unsuccessful as the court found that, in these particular circumstances, the police had a responsibility to enter the home without a warrant, do a pat down search of the accused and search for other occupants. Once drugs were seen in plain view, they proceeded to obtain a search warrant. Judicial notice was taken of the fact that complainants in domestic situations often recant due to threats of coercion by their partners. The defendant appealed. Appeal allowed; conviction set aside; although a violation of the defendant's Charter rights had occurred, the record was insufficient for this court to engage in a s. 24(2) analysis. Although it was reasonable, in the circumstances, for the police to search for the girl, go to the defendant's home and not simply leave once she told them she was fine, the trial judge erred in failing to consider alternatives short of police entry (such as conferring with the girl after they had her step outside and close the door) and the search of the home, without a warrant. Police authority to investigate such a call includes locating the alleged victim and determining if their assistance is required, but, without more, does not extend to the entry or search of the premises.","The accused was found guilty of several drug offences after being arrested. The accused had been charged with possession and use of drugs in a home where his mother had advised him that she was fine. The police had entered the accused's home after receiving a distress call from the accused. The call was not a 911 call but rather a 'coming to get your daughter' type call. The officer entered the home at approximately 10:30 p.m. The complainant advised the police that there was a person lying on the bed and that she had gone to the accused’s house.

The tenant received notice of the hearing late on Friday when the hearing was set for Tuesday morning. She immediately requested an adjournment as she was unable to attend personally. The tenant also submits that the notice failed to disclose a significant aspect of the complaint, namely the conduct of her boyfriend. HELD: Appeal allowed and the matter returned to the Director to schedule a new hearing with at least 7 days clear notice to be given of the date. The decision to grant an adjournment is inherently discretionary and should be made with a view to what is necessary to ensure justice is done between the parties. This should include consideration of the complexity of the issues, the tenant's personal circumstances affecting her ability to attend in person on short notice and any prejudice to the landlord if the request is granted. There is no evidence that any of this was considered by the Hearing Officer. Three days (including a weekend) is not sufficient time to make arrangements and prepare for any hearing. It is clear that the tenant took the matter seriously and spent considerable time preparing written responses to the landlord's claim as she knew it to be. On the issue of sufficiency of the Notice, the Court found that while the Notice outlined many issues, it failed to disclose issues relating to her boyfriend. Since these issues were only discussed at the hearing the tenant was unable to attend she was not able to advise in person or in writing that her boyfriend was now incarcerated and the issue resolved. The Hearing Officer, in accepting evidence from the landlord about the boyfriend when neither the Hearing notice nor the landlord's complaint contained notice of it, breached the rule of natural justice and due process. The reasonableness standard of review applies here.","The tenant appeals from the decision of the Hearing Officer granting the landlord possession of her rental premises. This self-represented tenant included, as grounds of her appeal, 'procedural violations' and'misinformation as to the purpose of the hearing'. HELD: The appeal is allowed. 1) The three days notice given to the tenant was insufficient to allow her to make arrangements to personally attend the hearing. The hearing notice was properly served personally. The tenant did not appear and the Hearing officer did not ignore the process. 2) The Hearing Officer, in accepting this 'boyfriend related evidence' when neither the Hearing Notice nor the landlord's complaint contained notice of it, breached the rules of natural justice and due process. The decision of whether or not an adjournment should be granted is inherently discretionary. The decisions must be taken with a view to what is necessary to ensure that justice is done between the parties. The discretion must be exercised judicially by the application of proper legal principles. 3) The notice to the landlord must contain sufficient particulars of the landlord’s claim so as to enable the tenant to prepare full and proper defence. The Hearing officer, in accept this “boyfriend’ related evidence” when neither it nor the tenant’ s complaint contained Notice of it breached the Rules of Natural justice and Due Process. The court found that both the failure to properly consider and grant the tenant the applied for adjournment in the particular circumstances of this case and the failure of the tenant with the particulars of her claim constitute reversible error. 4) The tenant”s request for an adjournments was not properly considered by the Hearing Office. The three-day notice given was insufficient. The four-day hearing notice raised numerous issues. It was understandable that the tenant would require some reasonable time within which to make arrangement to attend any hearing that was scheduled, to inform herself about her legal position and the nature of the nature and nature of her legal situation and to obtain assistance or advice from the Director’’ office or other persons in position to provide the same to her."

The court must consider the magnitude of the estate, the circumstances of the claimant, the strength of his or her moral claim to a share in the estate, and the situation of others having claims upon the testator.

The underlying action claims damages from the applicant with respect to the construction of a hog barn. The applicant was the general contractor. Each of the respondents issued a comprehensive general liability policy to the applicant. The law is clear that the pleadings determine whether or not the respondents have a duty to defend. If the claim alleges a state of facts, which would fall within the coverage provided by the policy, the obligation of the insurer to defend is triggered. The Court reviewed the claim and concluded that the true nature of the claim was that the applicant failed in its contractual duty to construct and deliver a hog barn suitable for the purposes intended. HELD: The application was dismissed with costs.  1) It is a fundamental principle of insurance law that a comprehensive general liability policy is not intended to be a means for a contractor to cover the expenses to correct its own faulty or defective workmanship. They are not performance bonds. 2) The claims in negligence are inseparable from the claims in contract and do not exist but for the contractual relationship. 3) The insuring agreement provided for the payment of all sums the applicant might become legally obligated to pay as compensatory damages because of property damage caused by an occurrence, which was defined to mean an accident. What is alleged in the underlying action was not an accident or occurrence.

The respondents take the position that under the policies they issued they are not obligated to defend (and to pay defence costs) for the claims brought against the applicant in the underlying action.

The application and breach are dismissed. 5) The defendant is also liable to pay costs in the amount of one-half of the claim. 6) The liability is only set out in the terms of the policy.

At the time of the trial they were leading separate lives but under one roof as neither would vacate the home. Given the respondent's age (77) the court did not want to specify a date that he had to move from the home. He had not left the home and the matter was scheduled to be heard June19/98. In the meantime a notice of appeal of the judgment was filed on behalf of the respondent. At issue was the interpretation of ss(1) and (4) of s15 of the Court of Appeal Rules. The respondent's counsel took the position that with the filing of the notice of appeal this court became functus. The petitioner argued the order for exclusive possession is an injunction and therefore is not stayed by the notice of appeal. Alternatively that the giving of directions as contemplated by the judgment itself would not constitute the taking of any 'execution of the judgment' or the taking of any 'further proceedings in the action' and therefore would not contravene Rule 15. HELD: All applications should be made to the Court of Appeal as the matter was now before that court. No case law could be found in support of either party. It was unnecessary to decide the issue as to whether Rule 15 operates to stay an order of exclusive possession.,"FIAT. The issues were around the interpretation of two rules regarding the application of Rule 15 and Rule 15 of the Court of Appeal. HELD: The execution of the judgment was stayed pending the disposition of the appeal. The court was prepared to provide directions. 1)The respondent was entitled to exclusive possession of the matrimonial home. The Court interpreted two of the rules respecting the appeal as follows: the giving of directions by the court would not constitute the taking of any further action or the taking in the action and would not contravene Rule 15. 2)The issue resolved around the interpretations of two conflicting rules regarding directions by this court as contemplated by Rule 15 which provide for exclusive possession and the possession of matrimonial property. No caselaw in support of the position of either party could be found. 3)The Court was directed to make all applications to the Court as directed by the Rule 15 notice of appeal bequests. 4)The parties were married for over 25 years and were now senior citizens. Given their age, the court did not want to specify a specific time period for the respondent to move from the matrononial home which was hoped that satisfactory alternate arrangements could be made within reasonable time to avoid the potential of the potential for a delay in a court order when his preferred accommodations might be available shortly thereafter."

That order had been made pursuant to s. 242 of The Planning and Development Act and required the respondent to comply with the zoning bylaw by desisting from operating an equipment storage yard on a parcel of land owned by him and to restore it to the condition it was in prior to his use of it. The respondent had purchased the land in 2009 and immediately began storing equipment and leaving junk cars and other materials on it. The applicant had tried to encourage the respondent’s voluntary cooperation with the bylaw but eventually issued the order. After the court granted the order, the respondent took no steps to comply with it and in August 2014, the applicant applied for an order declaring the respondent to be in contempt of court. The application was heard in September at which time the respondent submitted by affidavit that he had removed the old cars but believed that he was allowed to keep his equipment. He requested that he receive additional time. The respondent was given until December 2014 to comply with the order. At the hearing he deposed that he had spent a significant amount of time and money removing materials from the land and that he had found out from his counsel that his belief regarding the permitted use of the land was incorrect. Based on the appearance of the site, the applicant was not satisfied but agreed to adjourn the matter until May 2015 as nothing could be done during the winter. When the matter was reviewed in May, the respondent had removed more equipment but said that he was not able to move it all as he had no place to put the rest of it. The applicant requested that the court find the respondent in contempt and to impose appropriate penalties, authorize it to remove any remaining machinery and to add the costs of this removal and disposal to the taxes on the land and to make an order for solicitor-client costs in its favour. HELD: The respondent was found to be in contempt of court pursuant to Queen’s Bench rule 11-16(3) for his failure, without reasonable excuse, to comply with the terms of the May 2014 court order. The court authorized the applicant to remove and dispose of the equipment if the respondent had not done so within 30 days of the order issued. The court awarded solicitor-client costs to the applicant in the amount of $15,000 because of the respondent’s continued and unjustified failure to comply with the zoning bylaw. As the applicant might incur additional costs to remove the equipment, those costs would be added to the tax rolls of the property and become payable by the respondent if he had not purged his contempt within the allotted time.","The respondent was granted an order (under the 2014 Queen's Bench Rules) requiring him to comply with a 2014 order requiring him not to keep junk cars and abandoned vehicles on his land but to take steps to remove them from the land. The respondent applied for an order declaring him in contempt of court for his failure to comply. The applicant had previously been in contempt proceedings for failing to comply (see: 2014 Queen’s Bench Rules). The applicant now sought sanctions to further enforce the order and to vindicate the authority of the court. HELD: The respondent was found in contempt pursuant to Rule 11-27(1) of the 2014 Rules. The court was advised that the matter would be at the forefront of the province’S attention in the coming months and that the respondent would be able to continue to comply even if he was fined. The Court was also concerned that any additional financial sanction would be more akin to punishment than a fine. The defendant’ s conduct prior to the commencement of these proceedings did not generally warrant an award of solicitor and client costs but his continued and ongoing unjustified failure to compliance with the orders and the time it took him to complete the removal of the offending equipment would be of significant importance to the respondent. The contempt proceedings were ordered to be held for an amount of time exceeding the time they were authorized to be paid. The time that the court was required to impose fines was extended to February 2, 2015."

The Provincial Court Judge had acquitted him of a charge under s.253(b) on appeal. On appeal, the Court of Queen's Bench judge set aside the conviction and ordered an acquittal. The Crown appealed. HELD: Appeal allowed. 1)The trial judge erred in her assessments of the evidence and conclusions of the trial judge. In her analysis she made inaccurate assessments of facts and conclusions. The acquittal because of reasonable doubt on the.08 charge did not have a finding by the Court that he accepted the testimony of the testified witness that the blood alcohol was rapidly rising and was in the range of.068 to.81 at the time of driving. It was inconsistent with the facts and the judgment of the judge on those facts, which are his sole province, to say that the trial court did not say that Swan did not see any indicia of impairment. It is inconsistent with facts and his judgment on those factors, which is his sole Province, tosay that as the trial officer did, that the appellant did not show any indicial impairment. 2)Given the trial lawyer's acceptance of the expert evidence that the Blood alcohol was rising and in the Range of.68 to.81 at 8:00 p.m., along with the respondent's observation that he did not observe any impairment, the trial Judge ought to have concluded that the defence raised a reasonable doubt. This is a reversible error. The conviction cannot stand. The appellant is acquitted on the count of impaired driving. 3)The acquittal was reversible in that it was not necessary to deal with an argument that the Crown erred with respect to the nature of the charge when it focussed on post-driving conduct when the charge was care and controls. 4)The conviction cannot be set aside. The appeal must be allowed."

The pension of one spouse is matrimonial asset and subject to an equal division. The matrimony debts are matrimonies. The deceased is a high-school graduate and works outside the home.

8_2012skqb249.txt,"The accused was convicted of aggravated assault after stabbing another person several times in the mid-section. The Crown brought a dangerous offender application. The accused was 22 years old at the time of sentencing. His prior criminal record consisted of mostly youth convictions. The offender was a known member of an aboriginal gang. The evidence suggested he was somewhere in the middle of the gang hierarchy. The accused had professed some desire to leave the gang. He had written an article directed at other youth warning them of the pitfalls of gang affiliation. The article was published in a book distributed to at risk youth. The accused had looked into getting help to leave the gang, but admitted on the stand that he was not prepared to take steps to leave because he might need protection from the gang in the penitentiary. While incarcerated, he had gang drawings confiscated from him and he had been jumped by members of a rival gang while in custody. The accused had shown some initiative in taking anger management courses and had completed his GED while incarcerated. HELD: The offence was a serious personal injury offence within the meaning of s. 752 of the Criminal Code. The criminal record together with the evidence heard at the hearing establishes that when the accused has committed violent offences he has been under the influence of alcohol or drugs, under supervision by court orders in the community, has used a knife or had one in his possession and most of the offences were a result of the accused's affiliation with the Indian Posse gang. The Crown has established a pattern of repetitive behaviour within the meaning of s. 753(1)(a)(i). Dr. Holden assessed the accused and found him to be a high risk to re-offend violently. The Crown has also proven that the accused constitutes a threat to the life, safety, and physical or mental well-being of other persons as set out in s. 753(1)(a)(ii). The accused was declared a dangerous offender. However, the Court found that given the accused's youth, the fact that he had not had any of the intensive programming that is available in a federal institution and the fact that there was some chance the accused might leave the gang, a determinate sentence and long term supervision order would adequately protect the public. In imposing a determinate sentence, the Court also considered that the accused's acts of violence, with the exception of the predicate offence, had generally resulted in less than severe injuries to the victim and the accused had voluntarily taken some steps to address his issues while incarcerated. The accused was sentenced 6 years or 72 months in custody, less credit for remand, to be followed by a 9 year supervision order under s. 753.4(b).","The accused was found guilty of aggravated assault contrary to s. 268 of the Criminal Code and breach of an undertaking contrary to S. 145(3) of the Code. The Crown applied to have the accused declared a dangerous offender. The accused was convicted of attempted murder, breach of undertaking contrary and possession of a weapon dangerous to the public. The Court found that the evidence did not meet the statutory requirements of a dangerous offenders designation and that long-term offender designation was appropriate, with a term of imprisonment from four to eight years in penitentiary to a maximum of 10 years followed by lengthy supervision order toward the statutory maximum. The predicate offence was a serious personal injury offence within the meaning of s. 752 of the criminal Code."

At issue is what is meant by 'possession' in s.34(2)(a) and when Lake Air obtained possession or constructive possession of the trailers. HELD: The application was allowed with costs from Humboldt.  1)The parties filed an agreed statement of facts and focused on the priority issue as if the application had been brought under s.66. 2)'Constructive possession' means possession of the collateral by 'another person at the request of the debtor' as set out in s.34(2)(a). What constitutes 'possession' of collateral by the debtor within s.34(2)(a) was in dispute. Unless the property qualifies as 'collateral' a person cannot possess it as a 'debtor' within the meaning of the priority section. 3)The case law in Saskatchewan has interpreted 'possession' to constitute more than mere physical possession. Sections 22 and 34(2) of the new Act are essentially unchanged except for the addition of the constructive possession. S.22(2) restricts the scope of constructive possession somewhat but it applies only to s.22 not to s.34. 4)A person is not in constructive possession of collateral within s.34(2)(a) unless that person is a 'debtor' as defined, unless the collateral is 'collateral' as defined and unless another person 'obtained physical possession of the colateral at the request of that debtor'. 5)The first term of each lease agreement contained an acknowledgement by Lake Air that the trailer was delivered by Associates at the date and location set out in the lease. Such a clause is inconsistent with Lake Air having actual or constructive possession at an earlier date. Lake Air did not have constructive possession prior to December 1997 through either Bell or Mid-Canada. Neither was in possession of the trailers at the request of Lake Air.  6)The protection the Act gives to purchase-money security holders should be interpreted broadly.

The fact that the SGI files were still in their possession 11 years after the initial consultation showed that the firm was continuing to represent the plaintiff some 6 months after the original consultation, and were preparing to file a statement of claim. 2)The plaintiff's father was not involved. 3)The SGI notes produced from the SIA's conversations with the plaintiff's solicitor indicated that the Lavoie firm was still continuing to represented the plaintiff 6 months later than the initial statement of claims. 4)The applicants had some prejudice to the applicants by virtue of having destroyed the files, the death of the plaintiff, and the diminution over period of years.

The officer did not give evidence as to the grounds for his belief that the warrants met the s. 495(1)(c) Criminal Code requirement, i.e., that they were in a format set out in Part XXVIII and in force within the jurisdiction. In his charge to the jury the trial judge indicated that the arrest was for the assault against the third party and did not direct the jury to consider if the officer had reasonable grounds for believing that there were warrants outstanding. Allowing the appeal and ordering a new trial, that the evidence did not support the conclusion that the officer arrested the appellant for the assault on the third party and it was not made clear to the jury that they must make an essential determination if the officer had reasonable grounds as required in s. 495 of the Code, such that he was acting in the execution of his duty.","The appellant appealed his conviction following a trial in the Supreme Court before a jury on a charge that he did assault a police officer engaged in the execution of his duties contrary to s. 270(2)(a) of the Criminal Code. The police had responded to a disturbance call and found a person who was wanted by the police. When the police asked the person his name, the person gave a fictitious one. The appellant gave a police report to the police which was confirmed by the evidence. The officers responded to another disturbance call which was heard by the occupants of a residence nearby. The complainant confronted the police officer and kicked him hard in the abdomen. The two offences for which the warrants were issued and an offence arising out of the disturbance on LaHave Street were both charges for the police constable. The Crown appealed the conviction. Allowing the appeal and ordering a new trial, that the officer had the requisite grounds for belief as required by s. 495 of the Code."
5_2018skqb209.txt,"Contract Law – Sale of Land – FormationReal Property – Sale of Land – Oral Contract The plaintiff brought an action against the defendant for specific performance and damages. The plaintiff claimed that the defendant agreed to sell him three quarters of land. The defendant’s position was that there was no agreement and if there was, it was not in writing as required by The Statute of Frauds. The plaintiff made this application for a resolution of the initial question of liability as to whether an agreement was created and if it was, then proof of damages would follow. The plaintiff argued that a contract was created and that it complied with the statute because he made his offer in writing, via an internet-based land auction program, and the acceptance was orally communicated by a telephone conversation. Therefore, all the requisite elements of a valid land sale were present. The defendant had used a website to list 17 quarters of land for sale, including six quarters of relevance to the action. The website was intended to connect sellers of farmland with interested buyers in a type of “non-binding auction” to permit sellers to gauge interest in their land, find the best possible price and avoid realtor’s commissions if a sale were completed. The listing showed three groups of the farmland for sale, described as 1) three adjoining quarters (the subject quarters); 2) two quarters (the adjacent quarters) and 3) one quarter (unsold quarter). In his online comments to the defendant during the auction, the plaintiff said that he wanted all five quarters (the subject and adjacent quarters). The plaintiff bid on each of the above parcels and had the highest bid on the subject quarters, but that in itself did not guarantee the purchase under the terms of the online auction program. He stopped bidding on the adjacent quarters because he thought they were becoming overpriced. After the auction, the plaintiff consulted with family members regarding whether to pursue negotiations with any of the bidders. They discussed the problems that would occur if the subject quarters were separated from the adjacent quarters because the two blocks were owned by different individuals. The defendant then telephoned the plaintiff and gave him two package options for the sale, both of which resolved the identified problem by including the purchase of the adjacent quarters. The package options were to purchase the subject and the adjacent quarters for $1,050,000 (which was 5 percent more than the $625,000 the plaintiff offered for the subject quarters and his last bid of $375,000 on the adjacent quarters) or the subject quarters and one of the adjacent quarters for $840,000. At the end of the conversation, the plaintiff testified that he wanted to be sure that regardless of his response to the package option offers, he would be able to buy the subject quarters for $625,000. The plaintiff did not have concerns about the purchase because he said that the defendant told him that “we had them”. He believed that this indicated the defendant’s willingness to accept his bid on the subject quarters and that if he accepted either of the two options, then either of the newly accepted offers would replace the agreement respecting the subject quarters. The defendant’s interpretation of the conversation was that he declined to accept the offer on the subject quarters until he heard back from the plaintiff respecting the package options and then he would decide whether or not he would sell the subject quarters. He either misheard or misunderstood the plaintiff’s question about the subject quarters and denied that he gave any assurance that he would sell them to him regardless of his response to the package offers. The plaintiff called the defendant shortly after the first conversation and advised that he would not accept either of the package option offers but would immediately bring the deposit for the purchase of the subject quarters. The defendant told him to “hold off”. The plaintiff interpreted that to mean that there was no urgency regarding the deposit rather than that no agreement existed respecting the subject quarters. The defendant testified that he said he was not prepared to accept the deposit at this time, which meant that he was not prepared to accept the plaintiff’s bid on the subject quarters. Three days later, the defendant emailed the plaintiff and said that he would not be accepting the bid. The issues were: 1) whether a contract was formed; 2) if so, did the Statute of Frauds apply.  HELD: The plaintiff’s action was dismissed. He had not established on a balance of probabilities that he and the defendant were parties to a valid and enforceable agreement of sale regarding the subject quarters. The court found with respect to each issue that: 1) there was no contract. In interpreting the words of the first telephone conversation and the context of the bidding process, using the standard of the reasonable bystander, there was no consensus ad idem between the parties. The second telephone conversation had done nothing to alter that finding. Both the plaintiff and the defendant reasonably believed different things; and 2) the Statute did not apply as there was no contract.","The plaintiff and defendant were involved in a lawsuit regarding a sale of three quarters of land in the Rural Municipality of Hazel Dell. The plaintiff and prospective buyer had each made out packages of land for sale on an online auction platform. The defendant and plaintiff had each listed his farmland for sale and each made an offer to sell the land to the highest bidder. The bidding process for the land was very brief and the plaintiff and potential buyer did not bring any of their property to the table. The issues were determined through bidding and post-bidding. The contract was created and complied with the Statute of Frauds. The fact that the offer was made in writing and not in the form of an offer was the crux of the issue. The essence of the contract was that the two parties had agreed to make out the essential elements of a valid contract. The issue was whether the agreement was enforceable. HELD: The plaintiff was awarded general performance and damages and the defendant was awarded specific performance and loss. The court accepted that the defendant and prospective purchaser had an honest but incomplete understanding of the terms of the packages and that they were used to create a consensus. The evidence that the parties had disagreed was sufficient to constitute a breach of the contractual contract. It was not necessary to determine the facts of the case or to determine whether the contract had been breached. The Court ordered the defendant to make full and complete disclosure of any information that might be relevant to the litigation. The parties agreed that the requirement of writing under the Statutes of Fraud was an additional requirement to the usual essential elements, namely an intention to create legal relations, the essential element of compliance and the essential factors respecting the sale of the land. The contractual contract was not created solely on the basis of the defendant's offer. The package offer was not enforceable by the Statut of Fraud but was in accordance with its essential elements. The clause prohibiting the sale and acquisition of property by any third party is Statute-damaged. The provision of the StatUTE of Fraud is an essential element in the construction of a legally enforceable contract. There is no evidence that a contract was ever created between the parties that would have created the unsold quarter. The essential elements are the essential to the agreement and compliance with the terms. The only thing that could have created a legally enforced consensus is the Statuting of Fraud. The agreement was not breached because the defendant withdrew his offer. There was no evidence to support the allegation that the plaintiff had made any unreasonable or unreasonable effort to obtain information"
9_2009nsca91.txt,"The young person appealed his sentence on an aggravated assault conviction following a drive-by shooting and applied for release pending appeal. Although he alleged that he would suffer unnecessary hardship if kept in custody because he would fall behind in his schoolwork, prior to being remanded the youth had been asked to leave his high school as a result of safety concerns in the school. Application for release pending appeal dismissed. The young person would not suffer unnecessary hardship as he was able to attend high school classes several times per week in the youth facility while he awaited his appeal and, even if his appeal was successful, he would only have served four months custody before it was heard. Given the circumstances of the aggravated assault and his record of violent offences and numerous breaches of court orders, the court was not persuaded that the youth's release would be in the public interest.","The accused, a young person, pleaded guilty to aggravated assault contrary to s. 268(1) of the Criminal Code. Prior to being remanded, the accused was attending a youth centre where he also attended substance abuse and anger management programs. The accused was convicted of the charge, and was sentenced to 365 days custody followed by 122 days supervision in the community. The victim of the shooting appealed his sentence, arguing that his appeal was sufficiently meritorious that, by the time his appeal is heard, he would have served more than what is determined to be a fit sentence, and thereby suffer undue hardship if released. Application for release pending appeal dismissed; the accused applies for release from custody pending appeal. The Court of Appeal has a discretion to release the accused pending appeal and under the provisions of the Youth Criminal Justice Act it is not in the public interest to release him pending appeal; however, given the circumstances of the offence, his record of violent offences, and numerous breaches of court orders, release would be in the Public Interest. The onus on an appellant under s. 679(4)(a) of S. 671(1)(a), is much more stringent than for an appeal against conviction. The issues before the Court were the appropriate venue for an application for release and the circumstances in which the accused had been sentenced, the factors set out in the Youth Code and the preamble to the Act."
e_2009nssc318.txt,"The mother applied for retroactive support (table amounts and s. 7 expenses) for two adult children. The father resisted the application in relation to the oldest son on the basis that he was no longer a dependant child when it was filed. The evidence showed the son finished university before the application was filed. His graduation took place after, at which time he was already working full time and living with his girlfriend. He lived with his mother for few months because of relationship problems, but later moved back in with the girlfriend. He also received some assistance from his parents when he took time off work to retrain. The father felt the mother's application in relation to the younger son should be limited because of her unreasonable delay in making it. He argued retroactivity should be limited to three years from the date he received the application (months after it was filed). The mother argued formal notice was given when her lawyer sent a letter requesting additional support several years earlier. She asked the court for support retroactive to three years before that date, or longer (based on what she alleged was blameworthy conduct on the father's part). The evidence showed the mother was slow in responding to the father's request for particulars. Despite threatening legal action several times, it took her years to file the application. The wife's application for retroactive support in relation to the oldest son dismissed. He was no longer a child of the marriage when it was filed. He became independent when his schooling finished and he started working and living with his girlfriend. While his parents provided assistance during his relationship troubles and retraining, they did so voluntarily and not out of any legal obligation. Support for the younger son to be reassessed retroactive to three years from the date the application was filed (as opposed to received). The mother unreasonably delayed her claim by allowing it to languish for years. While normally the letter from her lawyer would be said to constitute effective notice, the notice here was voided by the mother's failure to prosecute the matter. The father did not engage in blameworthy conduct: he made efforts to respond to and settle the mother's claims; he paid a significant level of support; and he reasonably believed he was meeting his obligations. Here, the need for certainty for a payor parent weighs in favour of the father.","The parties were married for 22 years and have two children, aged 12 and 15. The oldest child left the charge of his parents and moved with his partner to Toronto, where they lived with their partner for a short period of time. The parties had two children: one of which was now independent and the other was a high schooler. The younger child continued to live independently with his mother. The older child required special education and a grade seven education to graduate. The mother applied to vary the period for which retroactive child support should be calculated, based on the respondent's contribution to section 7 expenses for the children. The father's application to vary was dismissed. The court did not have jurisdiction to consider the mother's application for retroactive variation of child support and a readjustment of the claim for section 7 expense pertaining to the older child. The issues were determined by the court to be the older son's blameworthy conduct and whether the father was guilty of blameness. The trial judge must not be blind to the prevailing social and economic conditions."

The mother was mentally competent and able to manage her own affairs at all times prior to her death; the Power of Attorney was granted solely for the mother's convenience as she was physically infirm. The daughter could only be called upon to account for her use of the Power of Attorney if it was used when the mother was incapacitated.","The plaintiffs sought a detailed accounting from their sister of her dealings with their mother's financial affairs pursuant to a Power of Attorney.

4_2006nssc88.txt,"The parties were married for thirteen years and had four children, who resided with the mother immediately following the divorce. The father paid one monthly sum ($6,000) comprised of both spousal and child support. Over a ten year period, all of the children had graduated from high school; two of the children had moved in with the father and he provided support directly to the other two children while they continued their education. After the first two children moved out of the mother's home, the parties orally agreed to reduce the child support payments. The parties were unable to negotiate a further reduction in the combined child and spousal support after the third child moved out of the mother's home. Since the parties' separation and divorce, the mother had not seriously pursued any educational retraining or furthered her education in her field of expertise; since the children had become independent, she occupied herself with volunteer work. The father now applied to terminate spousal support. The father shall continue to pay the sum of $3,000 per month as spousal support for one year; for the following year, the support will be reduced to $2,500 per month; in the following year, support shall be reduced to $2,000 per month, after which support will cease completely; the father shall continue his direct support of the children remaining dependant as they complete their current courses. Although the mother's effort in looking after four children and her absence from the workplace during the children's early years were significant factors, she had ignored her responsibility to move towards some sort of self sufficiency; given the number of children, the court extended the formula under the Spousal Support Guidelines beyond the maximum 13 year period; however, the mother must develop a reasonable strategy immediately to ensure that she either begins work in an area with better employment prospects or immediately attends courses to upgrade, refresh or enhance her ability to support herself.","The mother, who had been the primary caregiver of the four children for the past four years, and the father, who was the primary financial advisor, made regular payments of $2,000 per month to the mother, $25,000 to the father when the children left the mother's care, and $1,000 a month thereafter to the husband until they moved to Halifax, which was when the support was terminated. The father continued to pay the full child and spousal support and the mother destroyed any cheques she received in the previous $2k. The mother claimed she had no difficulty dealing with the father directly to obtain support. The evidence showed that she paid $52,000 in spousals and child support, and that the husband paid $25k in support which was deducted from the mother’s ongoing support payments. The husband continued to provide support to the parties, and in some cases, even after the children had left the care of the mother. The payments to the parents were substantial, and included an added charge of $20,000 for child and service charges. The parties’ income was reduced to $52 million in 2005, and 2005, respectively. The court found that the father’d paid $2.5 million in spouse and child care costs in the two years since the separation and in 2005 he was paying $25 million in child and support support. In some cases the father had also provided additional financial support, such as $1 million in excess kilometres and repairs, to the wife’ll. The wife had taken some voluntary steps to assist her in finding employment, but she did not pursue this as a career, and had not pursued any educational retraining or furthering her education in her field. The family history of the children leaving their mother”s care and moving in with their father or being supported by their father was not reliable. Her calculation of arrears under the old order was mostly speculative. She believed she received 40-41% of the arrear, and she did nothing wrong by relying on the evidence of her former employers. The defendant continued to make regular payments to support the children, and even though she was paying spousousal and child maintenance, she did so in a manner that was in breach of the terms of the agreement.

He was suspended from the program since approximately March 2000. There have been a number of legal proceedings between the applicant and the University since then. An appeal committee of the University held that the applicant be allowed to resume his residency training on probationary terms. This decision has not been implemented. At issue is a College of Medicine policy governing students who are funded by third party organizations or governments. The applicant is such a student. His third party funding was depleted during the time he was suspended. The College of Medicine insists he must find a third party sponsor prior to being allowed to resume his program. The Lieutenant Governor requested that a judge of the Court of Queen's Bench perform her role as visitor in this matter. HELD: 1) The court found the College of Medicine has not been objectively reasonable in the exercise of its discretion to insist that the appeal committee decision will not be implemented until such time as the applicant obtains third party funding. The court found it did not properly or fairly apply the third party funding policy on the facts. 2) The applicant is entitled to relief. The appeal committee decision will be implemented by the College of Medicine if the following conditions are met. The applicant must enter into a written agreement with the College of Medicine whereby he agrees that the money he was paid while on suspension is prepayment for all of the services he will perform for the College of Medicine in the remainder of his residency, that he will not claim any salary or monetary benefits available to other medical residents pursuant to the PAIRS agreement, and he will indemnify the College of Medicine if it is required to make payments to him pursuant to the PAIRS agreement during the remainder of his residency program. Further, PAIRS will enter into an agreement with the College of Medicine waiving the financial terms of the PAIRS agreement with respect to the applicant for the duration of his residency. 3) The applicant will be responsible for paying tuition fees, administration fees, insurance fees and any other college fees payable by other medical residents but he will be granted a credit for the fees deducted by the College of Medicine during the time he was suspended.","At issue was a College of Medicine policy governing students who are funded by third party organizations or governments. The policy states that in order for a student to return to the college of medicine he must acquire third party funding. The student had been suspended from the program for five years. The College of Physicians and Surgeons appealed the suspension with pay and lost its appeal. The university defended the decision, arguing that it had not yet exhausted its appeals within the internal laws of the university and that the student had not succeeded in fashioning an appropriate remedy. The plaintiff also sought judicial review. HELD: The Court of Queen’s Bench approved the college’S position that any exception to the policy would affect the integrity of the policy. It found that the College of medicine was at liberty to apply the policy as it had in the past and that it would not affect its ability to pay salary to other residents. The court found that such an exception would not have a practical effect on the integrity and integrity of its funding policy. The Court ordered that the college would retain the full court judgment and execution of the appeal. 1)The court found the College was not in a position to intervene in the matter between the plaintiff and the university in its ex officio role as a visitor. The fact that the plaintiff had not proven that he had been a flight risk or that he was being sexually assaulted by the student did not disqualify him from returning to the program. The applicant’ s position that there would be no harm in allowing the student to re-enter the program was not supported by the facts. 2)The plaintiff was awarded his salary as called for by the collective agreement and the College retained the right to deduct all other fees, administration fees and insurance fees from his tuition fees and he was awarded a probationary period of one year. The costs of the application were $15,000. 3)The applicant was awarded the costs of his residency program on a probationar period of six months. The cost of the re-entry period was $20,000, with the plaintiff to apply for a new third party sponsor. The University was awarded $25,000 in arrears of salary.

1997canlii786.txt,"The parties executed a separation agreement that resolved all matters corollary to their divorce and the Matrimonial Property Act. The respondent husband proceeded with an uncontested divorce. The appellant wife did not oppose the proceeding. She subsequently appealed the corollary relief judgment on the grounds that the underlying separation agreement is unconscionable and unduly harsh. She sought to introduce fresh evidence bearing upon the circumstances leading up to the divorce. Dismissing the appeal with costs, that even with the new evidence, the appellant still failed to demonstrate an adequate excuse for not responding to the divorce proceeding. There was no evidence that the appellant did not understand her legal entitlement at the time the agreements were signed, or that she did not appreciate that a divorce proceeding had been commenced.","The parties were married for seven years and had two children, one of whom was born in the wife's custody. The wife was in the process of divorcing her husband when she signed the separation agreement. She alleged that she was suffering from lingering depression and that she entered the agreement improvising a separation agreement to alleviate the symptoms of her depression. The husband had been paying a substantial sum for the separation to be paid by the wife. The parties separated in 1996. The mother moved with the child to live with the father. The father pursued a second marriage, which lasted only briefly. The daughter was involved with a common law spouse but had sexual relations with the husband. The marriage was tumultuous and included some incidents of domestic violence. The evidence before the Court was that the wife was clinically depressed and on medication and that her doctor had advised her not to sign the agreement without legal advice. The draft separation agreement embodied the terms of the original separation agreement and was drafted by the husband's lawyer only. The substance of the agreements was not dissimilar from those in the previous cases. The Court was not satisfied that the appellant had a reasonable excuse for failing to challenge the separation agreements at the time of their separation. The application to admit fresh evidence was dismissed. The test for admission of fresh evidence in a custody proceeding is not the same as in a default judgment where a substantial issue has been tried and the parties have reached a conclusion that the agreement is unconscionable and unduly harsh. The tests for admission and application to be allowed fresh evidence are based upon the premise that the judgments granted in this matter, which incorporate the separation Agreement, equate to consent orders. The judgments granted to the Court in the divorce proceeding are not based upon a traditional test that a party must satisfy it has a reasonable ground to challenge a decision made in a new proceeding. The results of the appeal will not be appealed."
d_2013skca21.txt,"The appellant appealed the Queen's Bench decision that denied him damages for defamation (see: 2010 SKQB 249). The trial judge held that the defence of qualified privilege protected the Union and its representatives (the defendants in the action) when the latter republished a grievance defaming the appellant by falsely accusing him of having participated in the harassment of an employee. The trial judge fixed a provisional award of $25,000. The appellant's grounds of appeal were that the trial judge erred in finding that the defence applied and by assessing damages at $25,000. The respondents cross-appealed on the ground that the trial judge had erred in denying them costs. HELD: The Court held that the trial judge had erred in finding that the defence of qualified privilege applied. Although she correctly identified the law, she had not correctly applied it because she had not given sufficient effect to 1) the wording of the defamatory expressions; 2) the circumstances in which they were published and, in particular, the chronology of events and the separate instances of publication; 3) the persons to whom the words were published; and 4) whether what was published on each occasion was germane and reasonably appropriate to the specific occasion. In general, the Court noted that the respondents could have fulfilled their duty to notify its membership of the grievance filed by the member who alleged the harassment and made its effort to find witnesses to support the member's grievance by sending out a general notice. It did not need to name the appellant and make the allegations it did to achieve its goal. The respondent overreached, thereby placing the statement that the appellant had participated in the harassment of the employee outside the ambit of the defence of qualified privilege. The Court awarded general damages in the amount of $100,000. It held that the trial judge's assessment of damages was erroneous and founded upon mistaken principles of law. The Court was not bound by the range of damages mentioned by the Supreme Court in the Church of Scientology decision but only to apply the principles established in it to the context of this case. The provisional award of $25,000 for general damages was erroneous because the respondents published the documents by mailing them and placing them on the Union's website, over the strong objections of the employer. The respondents left the documents on the website for 6 months after the employer demanded that they be removed. The respondents had never offered an apology and appeared not to have recognized the harm that had been caused to the appellant. An award of aggravated damages was subsumed in the general award and the Court agreed with the trial judge that punitive damages were not warranted because the respondent had not been motivated by malice. The respondent's cross-appeal was dismissed without costs. However, their position was clearly correct in the circumstances: it was not appropriate for the trial judge to decline to order costs in their favour on the basis of 'mixed results', because in defamation cases, the results are invariably mixed.","The plaintiff union and its representatives republished a grievance defaming a member of management by falsely accusing him of having participated in the harassment of an employee. The union and the Hospital both appealed. Appeal allowed; general damages at $100,000 fixed; the trial judge erred by finding the defamatory statements are protected by qualified privilege. The plaintiff union's action was dismissed and a provisional award of $25,000 was fixed. The court reviewed the history of the grievance and found that defamatories had been published in part in the Union's grievance and that their publication would have a negative effect on the plaintiff's reputation. The trial judge correctly referred to the labour relations context and the purposes for which the communications were posted are more appropriately considered with respect to the defences to the tort of defamation. The jurisprudence may be tending to extend the cloak of absolute privilege to what has been described as'steps preparatory to judicial proceedings' but the purpose in this case was not so intimately connected with the process as to justify the extension of the defence of absolute privileges. The publication of the defamed statements destroys any possible claim that the Union might have to absolute privilege."

The accused was grossly lacking in mental abilities, had limited and basic comprehension, had the mental capacity of a young child and these facts were not likely to change anytime soon. The accused had extreme difficulty paying attention to the court proceedings and appeared incapable of doing so. He played with toys in the prisoner's box, paced around and pestered the deputy sheriff sitting with him for much of the proceeding.HELD: The accused was incapable of paying attention to the court proceeding or participating in a meaningful way because of his mental disability. The accused said that his lawyer was the judge, could not answer when asked what the judge's role was and he had limited insight into why he was in Court. The accused met the portion of the limited cognitive capacity test which requires an understanding of the nature of the proceedings and their possible consequences and the accused is capable of communicating his version of the events surrounding the allegations, but there is no possibility he could participate in a meaningful way in the trial. According to R. v. Jobb, the limited cognitive capacity test does not require that an accused be able to make rational decisions beneficial to himself, the Court's inquiry is limited to whether an accused can recount to their counsel the necessary facts of the offence to present a defence. The accused in this case was found fit to stand trial because he had a memory of what happened during the alleged offence despite having virtually no ability to participate in the proceeding.",The accused was found unfit to stand trial for various offences. The Court found that the accused was not only grossly lacking in mental abilities but also had a limited understanding of the nature of the proceedings and its possible consequences.
b_2009nsca127.txt,"A couple signed a separation agreement which included a provision whereby they agreed to renounce and waive any claim in the estate of the other and any right to share in the estate of the other, which terms were incorporated into a corollary relief judgment. When he died, the former husband had not changed his will, which left the residue of his estate to his former wife. The Chambers judge held that the separation agreement had not revoked the will and the former wife was entitled to the testamentary gift. The mother of the deceased appealed. Appeal dismissed; although the Chambers judge's reasoning was flawed, the appellant had failed to produce any legal authority that a contractual promise to renounce, given for consideration before the death of a former spouse, binds a person to renounce a testamentary gift after his death. Even if the former spouse were so bound, there did not appear to be any privity of contract which would allow the appellant, who was not a party to the separation agreement, to enforce it.","The testator had left his wife, the residue of his estate, a few years later. They subsequently divorced. After their separation, the executrix of their estate applied for an interpretation of the will and separation agreement. The deceased had never revoked nor changed his will nor had he revoked or changed the beneficiary designation in the Canada Life Policy. The executrix applied for the interpretation of that judgment. The trial judge found that the separation agreement did not revoke the will nor did it affect the deceased's ability to dispose of their Estate as they saw fit. The mother appealed. Appeal dismissed; the judge's reasoning was flawed. He relied on Billing, supra, Eccleston, and Ecclestone, which found that a contractual promise to renounce, given for consideration before the death of a former spouse, does not bind a person to renouncing an interest in something to which he or she has no legal interest. The language of the separation Agreement, which did not purport to revoke the party's wills, and did not use the word 'will' in the section dealing with estate claims, did not permit this conclusion. It would have been possible for the separation to include a clear waiver of the right of the parties to inherit under each other's wills if this was their intention. The clause in question was confined to release of rights of inheritance only on intestacy. It did not address the right to renunciation under will. The parties' separation agreement was bound by the terms of their separation agreement and the provisions therein were not binding. The evidence showed that the parties had agreed to renounced any claim in their estate and that the mother of the deceased was entitled to the gift. The only issue on appeal was whether the gift should stand. Appeal to the chambers judge was dismissed with costs."

The other personal representative of the estate, who was the intestate's spouse, was in receipt of survivor benefits under the pension and, as such, was opposed to the intended court action. The biological child applied to have his stepmother removed as a personal representative of the estate. Application dismissed; the removal of the personal representative would only be in the best interests of those persons interested in the estate if the intended lawsuit was feasible, which it was not. The estate was bound by the terms of the pension plan, which provided that the respondent was clearly entitled, as the spouse of the intestate, to survivor benefits and the payment of a lump sum into her estate if she died within five years of the intestate's retirement.","The Respondent was a spouse within the meaning of the Pension Benefits Standards Act and the Pension Security Standards Act, and therefore began paying survivor benefits to the applicant. The applicant opposed the respondent's application claiming that the pension should have been paid to the estate rather than the survivor benefits. The respondent argued that the applicant was in a direct conflict with the respondent as her spouse and that the two were in a position of direct conflict. The continuing payment of the survivor benefit is an immediate benefit to her, which would be lessened if it were to be paid to someone else. The Respondent, as Adminstratrix of the Estate, would be required to bring an action against herself in her personal capacity. The application for removal of the respondent was dismissed. The court found that the removal of Joan McGean as personal representative was not in the 'best interests of those persons interested in the estate' or would only be so if the intended lawsuit with the defendant were feasible. It would only been so if a lawsuit with Marine Atlantic were feasible, which it was not."

In preparation, the appellant applied to the Supreme Court for an order to inspect the respondent's bank records pursuant to s. 21(1) of the Evidence Act. The respondent argued he had limited involvement in the enterprise being discovered.

The appellant argues that the learned trial judge erred in law by applying an unreasonably high standard of due diligence to the facts of the case. HELD: The appeal is allowed, the conviction is quashed and a verdict of acquittal is entered.  1) The court reviewed in detail the steps the appellant had in place. 2) The court was of the view that the trial judge erred in applying an unreasonably high standard for this defence. The trial judge applied a standard of due diligence that required the appellant to be able to prove that there were no other possible precautions or action that could have been taken to prevent the company's cashiers from selling cigarettes. This standard exceeds the requirements of a reasonable person. By applying a higher standard of due diligence, the trial judge erred in law. Had the appropriate standard of due diligence been applied to the facts of this case, the appellant would have succeeded.","The defendant was convicted of unlawfully furnish a tobacco product to a young person contrary to s. 8(1) of the Tobacco Act. The defendant appealed the conviction on the following grounds: the trial judge applied an unreasonably high standard of due diligence to the facts of the case; the trial court erred in applying the doctrine of stare decisis; and the sentence was unreasonable by being inconsistent with the acquittal of the appellant in R. v. Westfair Foods Ltd. The trial judge correctly set out the state of the law surrounding the defence of due due diligence, and the trial Judge erred by applying an unre unreasonable high standard for this defence. The system implemented by the defendant in R v.Westfair Foods to prevent the sale of tobacco to minors was essentially the same as the procedure followed by the respondent in this case. HELD: The appeal was allowed and the conviction was quashed and a verdict of an acquittal was entered. 1)The trial judge erred when he applied an unreasonable high standard to the case. The defence of diligence in a strict liability offence, which is essentially the procedure used by the defendants in order to prevent sale of cigarettes to minors, was essentially identical to the one used by Westfair in this instance. The judge applied a higher standard of diligence which required the defendant to be able to prove there were no other possible precautions or actions could have been taken to prevent their cashiers from selling cigarettes. This standard exceeds the requirements of a reasonable person. 2)The defendant had an established system to prevent them from selling tobacco to youth. The court found that prior to the incident on August 25, 2003, the defendant had had an existing system created to prevent its cashiers selling tobacco products to minors. The evidence tendered at the trial suggests that prior the incident, prior to having an established systems in place to prevent that the defendant, who was charged in the offence, had an 'established system' in place in order for the company's cashiers to prevent those selling tobacco, to have taken all reasonable steps to prevent it from being commission-able. 3)The court found the trial judges erred because they applied an error in law by applying a unreason unreasonly high standard. The principles of due and due diligence are applicable to all types of business. The standard of correctness is the same in R and v. W.Friesen. The test shopper who was the test shoppers at the grocery store received a written Tobacco Sales Policy when they were hired."
e_2009skca138.txt,"This appeal concerns the assessment for municipal purposes of a building located in the City of Regina and used commercially as an enclosed shopping mall. The building was assessed in each of the years 2003 and 2004 on the basis of its 'fair value' as determined by the City Assessor. The owner of the building, the corporate appellant, was dissatisfied with the Assessor's determination of fair value and appealed the assessment to the local Board of Revision, then to the Assessment Appeals Committee of the Saskatchewan Municipal board. The appeals were allowed in part, but the corporate appellant remained dissatisfied. It applied for leave to appeal to this Court pursuant to s. 33.1 of The Municipal Board Act. The issues on appeal all relate to the determination of the fair value of the building and, more particularly, to the market adjustment factor used in that determination. The grounds take issue one way or another with the inclusion of the sales of the Southland and Victoria Square Malls in the array of sales from which the MAF was derived, or alternatively, with the adjustment of the sale price of these properties. HELD: Appeal dismissed. The appeal in relation to the treatment of the sale of the Victoria Square Mall fails, as does the appeal concerning the sale of the Southland Mall. The Court notes that other companies, owning or operating similar malls, also took issue with their 2003 and 2004 assessments. They, too, appealed to the Board of Revision and then to the Assessment Appeals Committee. They too were granted leave to appeal to this Court on the same grounds as the appellant in this case. Counsel for the companies agreed to treat this appeal as representative of the other appeals and to be bound by the result of this appeal. These other appeals are also dismissed.","The applicant company appealed a decision of the city assessessor, pursuant to s. 33.1 of The Municipal Board Act, that the city had erred in law in determining the fair value of a shopping mall by failing to include the sale of three malls in its assessment. The company argued the Committee erred by failing, in law, in failing to give effect to the fact the Assessor did not 'determine the sale price' of the mall as required by the Assessment Manual. The Committee found that the Assessors did not have regard for the sale sale price as it was a 'arm's length sale' as it did not include any atypical financing or other conditions of sale. The sale price satisfied the remaining criteria of the Committee. The court reviewed the various sales records and found that only the sale verification information obtained by the city was used to determine the sale value. The city had not erred. The assessment of the shopping mall came to rest on the City Assessor's determination of its fair value, which in turn came to focus on the sale rate used by the assessor in calculating the MAF. The committee did not find any material error on the part of the committee regarding the sale."

HELD: The Court refused to issue the order on the grounds that the Court must not be seen as legitimatizing, condoning, acquiescing or approving of an unconscionable bargain.","The court presented with a form of judgment bearing the consents of the two parties. At first blush, the Court should grant the parties the relief they appear to jointly be seeking. However, the proposed judgment are unconscionable. There has not been equality in the bargaining positions of the parties and the petitioner has chosen not to seek legal counsel and advice. The terms of the proposed consent judgment were improvident. The parties appeared content to receive assets mainly in the value of their car, which represents her receiving about 13% of the net value of the family property estate, leaving the remaining 87% to be the petitioner's share. The proposed judgment also provides the petitioner is not obliged to pay child support in the circumstances. When, upon the evidence filed, the terms of a consent judgment appear to be patently unfair or unconscionsable, the court must refuse the application. HELD: The Court ordered the consent judgment to be refused. 1)No reasonable person would conclude that the proposed judgement was anything but unconsc unconscioable. No reasonable person could conclude that it was anything less than unconscionalable. 2)The parties did not need Court order nor judgment to attain their apparent goals. It was certainly open to them to proceed with this arrangement without the formality of a judgment or contract. They were not required to pay any child support and there was no equality in bargaining positions between the petitioner and respondent. 3)When upon the facts filed the terms appeared to be unfair or unfair to one of the opposing parties, the Courts must refuse to grant the application pursuant to the Court's legal guidance and guidance. The Court could not condone the application nor the advice offered by the petitioner but would urge the petitioner to do so. The court could not afford to force the petitioner or the respondent to acquiesce or seek legal advice or guidance. 4)The Court could only grant the petitioner costs of the application and the officer's costs of providing legal advice and guidance but could not approve the application or the officer should be denied his legal assistance. 5)No legal advice was given, neither of which could be expected. The petitioner could not request legal advice nor the assistance of legal counsel. The officer should have asked for guidance and advice but could only have asked the petitioner if he was being urged to do it. The 18 year old girl would be 18 in approximately 18 months time.

As a result of the arbitration award, several lieutenants were demoted to the rank of firefighter. Denying the stay, that (1) there was no arguable issue to be tried on appeal; (2) there was no evidence the applicants would suffer irreparable harm if the stay were not granted; (3) the balance of convenience weighed against the applicants; and (4) there were no exceptional circumstances.","The applicants applied to have the arbitrator's award for 1989 demoted lieutenants set aside on the basis that the employer had failed to act in accordance with the terms of the collective agreement. The union alleged that the demoted liedutenants were acting in an acting capacity until a new routine was devised. The employer sought to use inexperienced personnel as lieutenant. The applicants filed an application for an order setting aside the arbitration award. The Union opposed the award, arguing that the notice went out to the union president indicating that up to fifty fire fighters would be moved within the fire department every two years. The applicant argued that this was based upon the fact that the union had not retained any experienced lieutenancy who had participated in the 1989 demotion. Application for stay granted; the union's position that the notices went out only to the demoting lieutenans and that they were acting as lieutants until a proper new routine had been devised. While not all of the demoteees were performing their assigned jobs, a substantial number were returning to their positions as lieutenant and lieutenant. The unions opposed the use of inexperienced lieutenancies as lieants. The arbitrator determined that the Union had not breached the collective agreements by permitting the demotion of the lieutenanted lieutenees who had performed their assigned positions within the rank of lieutenant and captain. The grievance alleged that this constituted an infringement of the union contract. The plaintiff was awarded $2,500,000 in damages. The court ordered that the amount of the arrears be set aside and ordered that damages be awarded to the plaintiff in the amount amounting to $1,000,000. The plaintiffs were awarded $1.5 million in arrear damages. Costs in the cause of action were awarded against the union for breach of the contract."

The first ground pertained to the defence’s contention that the officer who stopped the accused and made the breath demand did not have sufficient evidence of impaired driving. The officer testified that he was patrolling for impaired drivers on the night in question and observed the accused make a very tight right-hand turn, entering the untraveled portion of the road where the snow was soft. He noticed that her eyes were glassy and she was slurring her speech. She had just lit a cigarette, which suspects often do to mask the smell of alcohol. When she did put the cigarette out, he smelled alcohol on her breath. He asked her to step out of the vehicle and noticed that she swayed while standing still. She walked with a wide stance to the police cruiser and had to lean against it to maintain her balance. When he first asked the appellant if she had had anything to drink, she said that she’d had three but later said that she’d had five. He arrested her and made the breath demand. The defence argued that the trial judge erred in failing to consider other evidence that other vehicles had made similar turns and that the appellant did not require any assistance in leaving her vehicle and walking to the police cruiser, among other things. With respect to the second ground, the appellant advised the officer that she wanted to speak to a specific lawyer after being arrested. At the detachment, the appellant located the lawyer’s number and the officer dialed it. A voice message was left on the lawyer’s telephone but no return call was received. The officer advised the appellant she could call another lawyer, and initially she responded that she did not want to but wished to provide a breath sample. The officer was about to read her a waiver of her right when the appellant indicated that she wanted to call another lawyer. The officer called the number but received an after-hours message. He asked the appellant if she wanted to try another lawyer and she declined, stating that she was satisfied with leaving a message. She then provided her first breath sample. The defence argued at trial that the officer failed to advise the appellant of the availability of Legal Aid and failed to provide the Prosper warning, thereby breaching s. 10(b) of the Charter.  HELD: The appeal was dismissed. The court found that the trial judge had not erred: 1) by finding there was no s. 8 breach. The judge had not made any findings of fact that were not supported by the evidence nor did he fail to consider relevant evidence when he found that the officer had sufficient evidence that objectively supported his belief that the appellant’s ability to drive was impaired; and 2) by finding that there had been no breach of s. 10(b). The appellant had failed to act diligently in pursuing her right to speak with a lawyer and provided a clear and unequivocal indication that she had abandoned her right to counsel when she said she was happy leaving a message.","The appellant appeals her conviction under s. 253(1)(b) of the Criminal Code for driving with a blood alcohol content of over.08. The trial judge erred in finding there was no breach of her s. 8 Charter rights. HELD: 1) The appeal is dismissed. The court found that there was sufficient evidence, when viewed objectively, to support the officer's contention that the appellant was impaired. The standard of review on a summary conviction appeals is set out by R. v. Shepherd. 2) The appellant contends that the trial judge failed to consider that other cars had previously made a tight turn as evidenced by other tire tracks in the soft snow. Smokers will light up cigarette not solely for the purpose of masking the odour of alcohol on their breath but out of nervousness or other cause. The judge failed not to consider evidence that the accused's behaviour was out of the ordinary. 3) The trial court found there was insufficient evidence upon which a trier of fact, properly instructed, could reasonably reach the verdict. 4) The standard required for an effective waiver of counsel is very high. 5) The court dismissed ground one of the appeal. 6) The officer's four and one half years' experience as a police officer was not sufficient to make a finding that there had been a breach of s. 10(b) Charter rights (R. v Shepherd). 7) The evidence as found by the trial court was not palpable and overriding error. 8) The errors of fact are not excusable. 9) The police officer had four and a half years of experience as an officer. 10) The offences were committed in a fashion that was not consistent with breach of the s. 9 Charter. 10. The police officers were not required to make any observations or make any findings of fact that were unsupported by the evidence (e.g. the officer observed the appellant leaning against the police vehicle upon arrival at the police cruiser. 10). The police were not obligated to obtain evidence from the accused once she arrived at the vehicle. 11) The respondent's right to be given reasonable opportunity to contact legal counsel has been violated (R). The trial officer did not have any record in his field notes about the smell of alcohol emanating from her breath. The Standard required for a waiver of legal rights is very low. 12) The error of fact is not the only factor that must be considered in determining whether there was a breach (R Bernshaw). 13) The Saskatchewan Court of Appeal set out a series of 11"

An order was never issued and therefore, no judgment was taken out. The applicant now applied to have a formal judgment issued, and to vary the decision in favour of her having primary residence. Alternatively, she sought a Voices of the Child report. The applicant indicated that the child expressed a desire to live with her full-time. The parties’ affidavits conflicted as to their behaviour. The applicant indicated that the child told her he was required to continue skiing with the respondent even though he was having a seizure. She also indicated that the child told her that the respondent told his roommate he was going to stab the applicant and he called her crazy. HELD: The court found it appropriate to order a Voices of the Child report. It was determined that the variation application decision was dependent on the report. There were more issues at play than a bald statement by the applicant that the child requested to live with her full-time. The child was an appropriate age for the report, being over 12 years old. He was able to communicate effectively and the report would be meaningful to the court. The order was to be paid for through resources provided to the program. The parties were prohibited from discussing the report process with the child and they were ordered not to influence, coach, sway, or prompt the child towards particular views or statements for the purposes of the report. The application was adjourned sine die returnable not sooner than 14 days after the report was received by all parties. The judgment was directed to be issued.","The applicant seeks a Voices of the Children report to ascertain the respondent’s best interests.

The application is based on an alleged change of circumstances which includes the respondent expressing a desire to live full time with her. If a variation is not ordered at this time absent the report, Voices of The Children will be prepared to advise the Court on the best interests of the child. The parents are significantly strapped financially at this stage and are declining to make an order allocating costs to them. An independent assessment of the respondent is not determinative of the application. The best interests are still paramount and the wishes of the V. are not independently determinative.

Allowing the appeal, setting aside the sentence and imposing a sentence of two years in a federal institution, followed by one year probation, with an order prohibiting possession of firearms following release.

b_2002skqb131.txt,"The Crown appealed the dismissal of charges of impaired driving and driving with a blood alcohol level exceeding .08. The trial judge held the circumstances supported a special plea of autrefois acquit and that the manner of proceeding by the Crown was an abuse of process at common law. Alberta did not withdraw or abandon the charges and suspended his driving privileges for 3 months. Upon request, SGI also suspended his Saskatchewan driving privileges. At issue was whether the Alberta court lost jurisdiction; if so, whether that gave rise to a plea of autrefois acquit in Saskatchewan; apart from any loss of jurisdiction did the police procedure amount to an abuse of process at common law. HELD: The Informations were stayed. The trial judge erred in finding a plea of autrefois acquit was applicable but was correct in concluding Alberta lost jurisdiction. 1)The Information remained dismissed for want of prosecution. Jurisdiction over the respondent was lost when the information was not available in the Alberta Provincial Court, the appearance notice was not confirmed and the matter could not be dealt with (R. v. McGinnis). The Alberta court could have regained jurisdiction by issuing a summons or warrant within 3 months of February 6, 2001. A summons was not issued until August. The information was by then deemed to have been dismissed for want of prosecution pursuant to s.485(3). 'Deemed' in s.485(3) does not mean 'presumed until otherwise proven'. It means that the information is dismissed without any action by the court. Once dismissed the proceeding could only be recommenced with consent of the Attorney General or leave of the court, neither of which were obtained. 2)With respect to jurisdiction in Saskatchewan, s.476(b) grants concurrent jurisdiction to any province in which the offence may have been committed or committed within 500 metres of any province in order to prevent a charge from failing because of uncertainty as to location. The section was not intended to permit simultaneous prosecutions in two provinces or in a second province in the event of a failure in the first. 3)The respondent's appearance in a Saskatchewan courtroom as a result of a summons did not revive jurisdiction in Alberta. The Alberta proceeding was deemed to have been dismissed for want of prosecution on May 6, 2001. The charges have not been disposed of within the meaning of s.730(3). There was no finding in respect of which an appeal can be taken. The special plea of autrefois acquit is not available in these circumstances. 4)The prosecutorial conduct of the police in proceeding simultaneously in two provinces amounted to an abuse of process. The respondent was obliged to defend identical charges arising out of the same incident in two provinces for almost a year at substantial cost and stress. The police acted with arbitrary purpose and without regard for the principles of fundamental justice. The lack of malice or improper motive does not preclude a finding of abuse of process.","The Crown appealed a summary conviction appeal by the Crown when the trial judge dismissed charges of impaired driving and driving with a blood alcohol level exceeding.08. The trial judge held that the circumstances supported a special plea of 'autrefois acquit' and that the manner of proceeding by the crown was an abuse of process at common law. HELD: 1) The summary conviction appealed was dismissed for want of prosecution. The Provincial Court judge accepted the special plea and dismissed the charges. 2) The trial Judge erred in law in finding that the court lost jurisdiction as he specifically found that if there was a loss of jurisdiction it was over the offence. The special plea was not available in the circumstances of this case. The court was unable to agree that appearance by the respondent in a Saskatchewan court as a result of a summons issued before May 7, 2001 revived jurisdiction over the respondent. The Alberta proceeding was deemed to have been dismissed for wants of prosecution on May 6, 2001.  3) The informations sworn on March 1, 2001, and March 29, 2001 in this proceeding were stayed. The judge went on to rule on the common law abuse of due process application. He was correct in concluding that the Alberta Provincial Court had lost jurisdiction. 4) The provincial court judge erred by finding that a special pleading of autrefois acquitted could not be taken as the proceedings were abusive.

c_2014skpc114.txt,The plaintiff’s claim was dismissed. The plaintiff had not proven his claim on a balance of probabilities that the defendant was responsible for the damage to his lawn.,"The plaintiff alleges that the defendant applied a substance in the back alley next to his property which caused damage to his lawn in the Town of Wadena. A Back-Track Investigations and Special Services report supports the plaintiff's belief that damage occurred to their back yard lawn was caused by run-off and/or leaching of a substance from the back alley. However, the evidence does not support that. In preceding years, before it was moved to the Statchuk yard, it was used to store tools, machinery and applicators. The floor in it replaced before moving to his yard. The defendant's shed was used as a storage area for tools, equipment and applicator. The evidence does support the plaintiff’s belief that the damage occurred due to the shed and not the lawn. HELD: The plaintiff”s claim was dismissed. The onus is not on the defendant to establish an alternative source of the offending substance and this involves proving that the plaintiff was responsible for killing their lawn. For the reasons stated, he has not done so. The plaintiff was not satisfied on a balance of probabilities that the offending substances came from the alley or that it came from their property. The court dismissed the plaintiff on the basis that the onus was not on him to establish his claim on a balanced of probabilities and this involved proving that Mr. Statchusk was responsible."
c_1995canlii5774.txt,"The parties applied to the Court to resolve the issues of spousal support and a division of the matrimonial property. The parties had been married 4 years. There were no children of the marriage. The Wife had a university education but was unemployed. She had already received interim support in the amount of $1,500.00 per month for 1 year. HELD: 1)The support order was terminated effective November 30, 1995. 2)The Court determined the value of a resort property owned by the Husband in BC and permitted an exemption for its value as at the date of marriage. 3)The Court refused to permit the Wife to subtract from the value of her assets, the amount owing on a student loan which pre-dated the marriage. 4)With the exception of those items already discussed, the Court divided the value of the matrimonial property equally.","Three issues were resolved as follows: the date spousal support should terminate, the value of property in British Columbia and whether the wife's student loan was a matrimonial debt. The husband was ordered to pay $700 per month for another year. The wife was unemployed and had not one job interview in 1 year. She was still unemployed and unable to find employment. The court considered the value at the time of separation to be $49,000. The respondent suggested partial payment by spousa roll-over of R.R.S.P. funds and payment of the balance by monthly payments. The judge found the value to be in $49k and ordered the respondent to pay the sum of $7,500.00 per month. The issue of the value was whether the husband's student loans were a matrionial debt or a matristonial debt and determined retroactively to April 1995. HELD: The husband's obligation was to end November 30, 1995 and the value would be divided accordingly. 1/2 share to each party 51,752 was to be paid. The loan was used to pay debts incurred by the wife prior to the marriage. Her health was fragile. The applicant's counsel did not consent to the proposal. Arrangement for payment was left to the parties."
a_1995canlii4315.txt,"The appellant was convicted of operating a motor vehicle while impaired. His conviction was upheld on appeal to a summary conviction appeal court. This appeal was based on the argument the provincial court judge's decision failed to provide reasons for accepting the evidence of various witnesses, failed to make findings of credibility with respect to witnesses, and failed to comment on the credibility and evidence of the witnesses. The appellant complained the judge did not provide adequate reasons for the decision. Dismissing the appeal, that the decision was supported by the evidence. The court referred to R. v. Burns, [1994] 1 S.C.R. 656 at 664, where the Supreme Court of Canada held that if trial judges state their conclusions in brief, and these conclusions are supported by the evidence, the verdict should not be overturned merely because they fail to discuss collateral aspects of the case.","The appellant appealed his conviction for driving while impaired by alcohol or drug. The Provincial Court Judge had reserved his decision and then found him guilty. The Summary Conviction Appeal Court Justice dismissed the appeal. The appellant sought leave to appeal and appealed the conviction. The trial judge had been required to provide reasons for accepting the evidence of various witnesses, his own testimony in respect to his drinking and ingestion of medication, and his medical doctor respecting his prescribing the medication to the appellant. The defence argued that the trial judge erred in law by entering a conviction when the form of Information before the Court was not bilingual.

b_1993canlii6618.txt,Members of the Association of Professional Engineers who were also SIAST employees challenged the statutory provisions and collective bargaining agreement whereby they were compelled to become members of the SGEU. In Queen's Bench it was held that the statutory provisions which created two bargaining units for institute employees and required certain employees to be union members did not violate s.2(d) of the Charter. Appeal dismissed,"The appeal from 1992 CanLII 7943 (SK QB), [1992] 6 W.W.R. 116) must be dismissed. There is some confusion as to the answers he gave to the questions posed in his judgment. In an addendum, he said the answer to question should be no. It seems clear that he was referring to question 5, rather than question 4. The result is the same. The case was put to the court below prematurely, with the result that it was put on what was essentially a hypothetical basis, and Charter decisions should not be made without sufficient factual base. There was no evidence that the appellants or any of them had yet suffered any adverse consequences as result of the impugned legislation, although proceedings were pending before the Labour Relations Board which might result in adverse consequences. More particularly, there was no suggestion that anyone had lost their job or had been in any way penalized for refusing to either pay union dues or to join the union, nor was there any evidence as to why anyone objected to being a member of the bargaining unit in question or the union in question so as to permit any reasoned decision as to whether to associate."

The evidence at trial indicated that the alleged acts had occurred prior to the accused becoming an adult. He had not been ordered transferred into adult court under s.16 of The Young Offenders Act. HELD: Accused acquitted. 1)The Judge was satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt that the accused had sexually assaulted the complainant. 2)Because the complainant's evidence suggested that the assault occurred while the accused was a young offender the Judge concluded that the Court of Queen's Bench was without jurisdiction in the matter.,"The sole issue before me was whether it was proven beyond a reasonable doubt that the sexual assaults alleged occurred on or after October 22, 1986, the date that the accused became an adult. The case had not come to the Youth Court by way of transfer from the Youth Courts. A concurrent proceeding was pending in Youth Court. HELD: 1)Jury selection was ordered. 2)The complainant was not satisfied that the offences occurred on the day he became an Adult. Although the one or two incidents of improper touching took place after the sexual intercourse incident, she quite frankly admitted that he was under 14 at the time. She turned 10 on the first date and was almost 11 when he became adult. 3)The accused was acquitted of the charge in the indictment. 4)The Court of Queen's Bench had exclusive jurisdiction only when a matter is transferred to it pursuant to s.6 of the Young Offenders Act. 5)The evidence was not properly assembled as it could have been. 6)The Crown did not ask the complainant when she turned 11 or when she became an adolescent."
5_2001canlii345.txt,"The accused was charged with operating an overweight vehicle on a weight restricted road contrary to s.38(1)(b) of the Highways and Transportation Act. No permit had been issued for the tractor trailer. The defence argued the document entitled 'order for road restriction on provincial highway #332 pursuant to s.35 of the Highway Traffic Act' was not proof of the Minister's order according to law; even if the document is proof, the order is a 'regulation' under the Interpretation Act and so the provisions of the Regulations Act applies; since those requirements have not been met, the Crown has not established an order had been made for the purposes of this case. HELD: It was not proven beyond a reasonable doubt that the accused violated s.38(1)(b). It was not established that the order was published for the purpose of this prosecution nor that the document filed in court is proof of the order itself.  1)It is well known that in a criminal case a provision that enables the Crown to expeditiously prove certain elements of an offence must be strictly satisfied. Since a violation of the HTA is prosecuted under s.4 of the Summary Offences Procedure Act, which in turn adopts the Criminal Code summary conviction procedure, the Crown must strictly comply with the provisions respecting proof.  2)It is mandatory for the Minister to give notice of the order and there was no evidence he exercised his discretion by determining the most advisable manner in which notice was to be given. The Minister failed to take appropriate steps to cause notice of the order to be given. The Department of Highways placed road signs warning and advising of weight restrictions on the highway and along grid roads accessing #332, but no notice was given to the general public. Notifying persons who reside or do business in the immediate area of the road is not sufficient to satisfy the requirement to publish. 3)Even if it could be said sufficient notice was given, it could not be concluded that the endorsement upon the order that the order 'conforms to the original' meets the statutory requirement that the copy must be a certified copy 'under the hand of an officer or person in whose custody the...public document is placed' (s.12 SEA) since it was not known if she had custody of the document or under the hand of any of the persons set out in s.7(c) of the SEA since her official capacity is not described. The order was not published in the Saskatchewan Gazette and so a copy of the order so published could not be produced (s.7(a) SEA). It was not proven that the copy of the order had been printed by the Queen's Printer (s.7(b) SEA).","The accused was charged with operating a motor vehicle that violated the Minister's weight order contrary to s38(1)(b) of the Highways and Transportation Act, 1997. The accused was stopped by a Swift Current police officer as he was proceeding through a rural area when he noticed a tractor trailer travelling in an easterly direction. The officer noted that the trailer was overweight and the owner of the tractor indicated that an alternative truck route was available. The Provincial Court did not issue a notice to the accused and the accused did not receive such notice. Traffic signs were located along a rural highway, some of which were in the vicinity of the Swift Current junction, others were marked with yellow and red signs stating the restriction. No other notice was given to the municipal division in which the grid roads were located or to entities that were involved in the transport of goods. The municipality appeared to have taken it upon itself to advise persons in the municipal divisions affected by the weight restriction and to advise other persons in their immediate area that were in business of hauling. No Other Notice was Given."

H.B.'s child born in 1995 was apprehended at birth and was currently subject of a child protection hearing. The Minister relied on the Public Trustee Act and, alternatively, on the court's inherent parens patriae jurisdiction.HELD: The Public Trustee was appointed amicus curae to act on behalf of H.B. upon being satisfied she is unable to act for herself. An assessment was ordered pursuant to s32 of the Child and Family Services Act. The order was to issue unless the Public Trustee shows cause as to why it is not the appropriate party within 10 days from the date of this order. 1)While the wording of s32 is ambiguous the Public Trustee was correct that the Act does not authorize it to represent an adult under a mental disability other than where a property interest is involved. Nowhere does the Act authorize the Public Trustee to act as personal guardian of a dependant or mentally incompetent adult. The PT Act does not authorize its appointment as litigation guardian in the matter of child protection proceedings. 2)Pursuant to its parens patriae jurisdiction the Court has a responsibility to protect the interests of H.B. who requires independent representation to ensure her rights are protected.

However that becomes more evident when s.32 is considered in the context of the entire Act. It is intended to authorize the Public Board to protect and administer the property of infants and dependant adult children.

The owner of the rink claimed financial compensation for a subsequent decline in his business which he alleged was a direct result of the broadcast. The script and reel had been destroyed and it was impossible to recreate exactly what was aired. HELD: The action was dismissed with costs. 1)Nothing that the defendant published was false, malicious, dishonest, negligent or recklessly published without careful justification, improper motive or excuse. 2)The station followed the CRTC Regulations and was exonerated entirely by its controlling body. The defendant published the news it received from the police, a proven reliable source. 3)Nothing pointed to the defendant as being the cause for the loss of profits by the plaintiff's roller rink operation. The business was on a down side at the time. The assault occurring where it did was not the fault of either party. If it had a bearing on the immediate attendance figure it was minimal and the plaintiff did no promotion whatsoever to increase attendance.","The plaintiff's radio station was in the business of broadcasting news about a sexual assault at a roller rink. The defendants had been known to broadcast news about the incident at the rink for several years. The plaintiff's employees were often inconvenienced or not able to attend work. The defendant's newscast, which purported to report the news about an assault at the roller rink, was never requested by the plaintiff. The employees were treated as second-class citizens and their attendance at the station dropped as the newscaster broadcast went on. The court found that the defendant published the information that it received from the police, the general public, and the insurance industry. The fact that the plaintiff had been accosted by two juveniles at the same time did not constitute a breach of its statutory duty to report such activity. The defamation suit against the defendant was dismissed with costs."

As the appellant had indicated to the physician that he had been drinking, the RCMP constable read demand for blood sample, which the attending physician attempted to obtain. The appellant refused and asked to speak to his lawyer. Unable to contact lawyer, the appellant refused to supply blood sample and was charged with refusal under s. 254(2) of the Criminal Code. The trial judge had held that as the physician attempted to obtain sample for medical purposes, he was not acting in the capacity of agent of the state, and his actions were not subject to the Charter. Dismissing the appeal, that while there may have been some issues of breach of confidentiality, the physician's actions were not analogous to search and seizure within s.8 of the Charter. The trial judge did not err in determining that the appellant's rights were not violated under either s.7 or s.8 of the Charter.",This was an appeal against a decision wherein the appellant was convicted of an offence contrary to s.254(5) of the Criminal Code. The Court had held that the police officer who had accompanied the accused to the hospital for treatment for injuries received in a single motor vehicle accident was not a 'patient' or 'doctor' as he was a patient. The appellant had been drinking and had been in a motor vehicle Accident which had not previously been reported. The doctor had then prepared a medical report for the hospital in response to a written request by the police. The patient was intoxicated at the time of being treated in the emergency department.

8_2016skqb154.txt,"HELD: The order was granted. Following the expiry of the current temporary order, the court found that the children were in need of protection pursuant to s. 11 of The Child and Family Services Act. As the father had taken no steps to deal with his anger, violence and alcohol issues, the children continued to be in need of protection as they were likely to suffer physical harm at his hands. Their psychological well-being required that they remain in protection to allow them to deal with the trauma they had suffered while they were in his care. Therefore, the court found that because the children were doing well in foster care and did not wish to be returned to their father and that the expert had advised against them having any further contact with him, it would make a permanent order rather than a long-term order.","HELD: The court found that the children had made nothing short of remarkable progress. They were found to be in need of protection, as they were the result of a continuous, ongoing, long term effort by the parents. The Ministry had taken no measurable steps to deal with their anger, violence and alcohol issues. The children's emotional and psychological state required them to continue to be protected. The parents had not taken measurable steps in dealing with their father's anger, aggression and alcohol problems. They had not seen the father for the past three years. The child protection worker had been retained by the Ministry to complete a parenting capacity assessment report. The father had been absent from the children's lives for the entire period of time. The evidence showed the children struggle on an ongoing basis from the trauma they experienced at the hands of their father."

The residential school was located at Beauval in the Province of Saskatchewan. The accused was considered the golden-haired boy of the priests and nuns and was very popular with the boys there. The Court noted that most of the complainants were from the rural areas and had attended one or more residential schools. The Church was a traditional, stable family life. Many of the victims attempted to put these acts of sexual violation out of their minds for much of their adult lives. HELD: The Court reserved its decision respecting this application and undertook to render a decision at the time of its final judgment. 1) The Court accepted that there is less likelihood of moral prejudice, reasoning prejudice and propensity reasoning in a judge alone trial as opposed to a jury trial. However, there is a potential distraction of the trier of fact from its proper focus on the facts charged and the potential for undue time consumption. 2) There are numerous instances of similar fact evidence being used to bolster the credibility of each complainant. However the Court was unable to determine whether these were similar facts evidence or similar facts of sexual assault or whether similar facts were adduced by the accused himself. 3) The accused had an ability to interact and bond with the people in his life. He was awarded $50,000 in damages for each victim who spoke up and participated in a variety of activities. 4) The Crown was required to consider the potential distraction from the triering of fact evidence from its Proper focus on facts charged, and the risk of overall prejudice."
c_2012skqb372.txt,"The plaintiff purchased insurance from the defendant. In 2000, the plaintiff's farm was damaged by a fire. He commenced an action against Wawanesa Insurance Company in 2001. In 2006, the plaintiff commenced an action against the defendant, alleging that the defendant was in breach of contract or negligent for failing to obtain full replacement value insurance coverage for the plaintiff. The defendant filed his defence in April 2007. Mediation took place in September 2010 and examinations for discovery were held in May 2011. At that time, the defendant asked the plaintiff to disclose the amount recovered in the Wawanesa lawsuit and the plaintiff refused. The defendant brought this application for relief that: 1) The plaintiff's action be dismissed for want of prosecution; or 2) The plaintiff be required to disclose the amount recovered in the other lawsuit. The defendant argued that the delays between the issuance of the statement of claim to the examination for discovery and then the delay between the time of mediation to May 2012 when the plaintiff's counsel filed the reply to undertakings were both inordinate.HELD: The Court applied the test established in International Capitol Corp. v. Robinson Twigg &amp; Ketilson to determine whether or not a matter should be struck for want of prosecution. The Court found that the first delay was inordinate but because the plaintiff and defendant both acknowledged that the action against the defendant would only proceed depending on the outcome of the claim against Wawanesa, the delay was excusable. The Court found that the second delay was excessive, but was not sufficient to strike the claim on that basis. Applying the factors provided in Capitol, the Court found:1. Stage of litigation: It did not occur at an early stage of the litigation as the matter could well go to pre-trial conference. 2. Impact of delay: The delay was not causing any problems for the defendant. 3. The context in which the delay occurred: the delay in question was actually only one year during which the plaintiff's counsel did not respond in a timely fashion to undertakings. 4. Reasons offered for delay: Counsel was busy and it had to determine which undertaking could or could not be answered. 5. The role of counsel in causing the delay: The Court held that the delay caused by the plaintiff's counsel should not be a reason to deprive the plaintiff of his claim for actions beyond his control. The Court denied the application to strike the plaintiff's claim but ordered that the plaintiff disclose the amount obtained in the Wawanesa action on the basis that this case fell into the exception to the policy which protects settlement communications. Here, the communications sought by the defendant were relevant and necessary to avoid double recovery.","FIAT: The applicant brings an application for relief in the alternative under Queen's Bench Rules 11 and amendments to that rule. HELD: The Court of Appeal has set out the principles for determining whether or not matter should be struck for want of prosecution in International Capital Corp. v. Robinson Twigg & Ketilson. The delay in this case would simply be the one-year period it took the plaintiff's counsel to respond to the undertakings. This would be an excessive period of time and would lead the Court on its own to strike. The time between the application for a strike and the application to compel the plaintiff to disclose the settlement amounts from its settlement in the Wawanesa claim is 1 year. This time period is not at an early stage that it would lead court on its Own to strike the claim. The defendant has made its case and ordered the specific amounts for each structure for which Wawanea settled its claim to be disclosed. The reason for the delay is not that it is inordinate but that it was excusable. The length of the delay would simply BE the one year period that it took plaintiff's lawyer to respond the undertakes. While one year is an excessive time it is not such as to lead the court to strike on that basis. As the defendant is retired from active business, this delay is nothing to displace his position that the delay was caused by the defendant doing nothing during that period to support another compelling or overriding interest of justice."

d_2000canlii19583.txt,"The accused was charged with assault causing bodily harm contrary to s.267(b) of the Criminal Code. HELD: The accused was found guilty.  1)The case law from other jurisdictions was reviewed. Given the law as it presently stands in Saskatchewan the Crown does not have an obligation to prove that bodily harm caused by the assault was objectively foreseeable and that the assault would subject the victim to the risk of bodily harm. The Court of Appeal expressly stated that R. v. Nurse was incorrectly decided and prefers the approach in R. v. Brooks which held the elements of assault causing bodily harm consist of the mens rea to commit the assault and the intentional application of force which results in bodily harm. 2)The victim would not have suffered bodily harm if the accused had not assaulted him. The assault was more than an insignificant or trivial cause of the bodily harm. While the bodily harm resulted directly from third parties falling on top of the accused and the victim, the third parties involvement was due entirely and as a direct result of the actions of the accused. It was clearly the accused who initiated the pile up. The accused placed the victim in a dangerous position, similar to that in the Samuelson and Brooks decisions. A very short period of time elapsed between the assault and bodily harm.","The accused was charged with assault causing bodily harm contrary to s. 267(b) of the Criminal Code. The accused was standing in front of the victim's motorhome when he was punched in the face and the victim fell to the ground. Less than one minute later the victim was run over by a truck. The Crown called two disinterested witnesses, the 15-year-old mascot for the Raider Hockey Club and another fan. The two disinterest witnesses testified that the accused and the 15 year-old were wrestling and the third witness stated that the second witness said the phrase 'kill him, kill #57' while he was running away. The trial judge found that the disinterested witness's testimony was sufficient to support the charge. The court found that once the accused was convicted of assault causing death, the Crown did not have to prove that the kick was a contributing cause of death outside the deminimus range. The offence was committed because the disinterest witness's evidence was so close to the truth as to be reasonable. The defence argued that the trial judge misinterpreted the demining test in Nurse, which held that the Crown must prove objective foreseeability in order to have a reasonable chance of proving the assault was a cause of bodily harm. The Court of Appeal also held that there was no evidence that the driver's intent was the only contributing factor. The Saskatchewan Court of Court did not follow Nurse, but rather held that it was the accused driving that was the contributing cause. The issue was whether the assault contributing cause was more than an insignificant or trivial cause."

The judge held that the usual rules of evidence pertaining to criminal trials apply to a s. 810.2 hearing and that records kept by the Correctional Services of Canada (CSC) were inadmissible as business records under s. 30 of the Canada Evidence Act. The respondent had been convicted in 2009 of robbery with violence, assault causing bodily harm, assault and three counts of violating bail. He was sentenced to three years' imprisonment. In May 2010, the CSC referred the respondent's case to the National Parole Board (NPB) with a recommendation that he be detained until warrant expiry, in accordance with s. 129(2) of the Corrections and Conditional Release Act (CCRA). The recommendation was based upon the character of the respondent's offences and where there are reasonable grounds to believe that the offender is likely to commit another offence causing death or serious harm if released on parole. The NPB ordered that the respondent be detained in custody until the expiry of the sentence. Reviewed annually under the CCRA, the CSC prepared another assessment in 2011 and the respondent was not released from custody until March 2012. At that point, a 'warrant expiry package' was prepared by a parole officer, comprised of CSC records relating to the respondent, including a criminal profile report, the assessment for decision reports and copies of the NPB's reasons for ordering detention. These records were sent to the RCMP in Saskatchewan. The officer concerned then swore the information under s. 810.2, stating that he believed that there were reasonable grounds to believe that the respondent would commit a serious personal offence as defined by s. 752 of the Code. The application for a hearing was commenced in August 2012. The parole officer and the RCMP officer were called to testify and the Crown applied to have the documents in the package admitted into evidence, and the respondent opposed the application. The judge refused to allow the admission of the report, the assessment and the NPB reasons for ordering detention based upon R. v. Fontaine and R. v. Toulejour. Based on the business rules exception, the judge held that the criminal report profile was inadmissible because it was a copy and not accompanied by supporting affidavits as required by s. 30(3) of the CEA. HELD: The Court held that the application was allowed. The Supreme Court had confirmed that s. 810 hearings are not criminal trials and that the rules of evidence in criminal trials do not apply. Hearsay evidence is admissible and the judge is to determine whether or not sufficient weight can be given to the hearsay evidence to establish reasonable and probable grounds required for the individual to swear the information to justify the fear of harm to others by the respondent. The Court held that all of the CSC records submitted as part of the package were admissible under the CEA. The Court directed that the matter be returned for a new hearing of the original application.","This is an appeal from the decision of the Provincial Court dismissing an application for a recognizance pursuant to s. 810.2 of the Criminal Code. The issue is whether the usual rules of evidence pertaining to criminal trials apply and that hearsay evidence was inadmissible. HELD: The Court decided that the usual criminal rules of law apply and the hearsayevidence was in admissible. The judge also held that records kept by the Correctional Service of Canada (CSC) were inadmissible as business records under s. 30 of the Canada Evidence Act. The Court found that the normal criminal rules apply to s810 hearings. The Crown applied to have the criminal profile report, the assessment for decision reports and the NPB's reasons for ordering detention admitted into evidence. The defendant opposed the admission of these documents. The court found that there were errors in law in that the Court found the usual business rules of the evidence do not apply in s.810. The accused was not disadvantaged in his application."
2_2008skca172.txt,"The appellant was tried by Queen's Bench judge sitting alone and found guilty of operating a motor vehicle while his ability to operate the vehicle was impaired by alcohol, thereby causing death contrary to s. 255(3) of the Criminal Code, and causing bodily harm contrary to s. 255(2) of the Code. He was sentenced to 5 years imprisonment after having been given credit of 1 year for the time served on remand. The appellant appeals both his conviction and sentence. On the conviction appeal the appellant raises a technical ground in relation to the manner in which the appellant was charged as well as issues of the propriety and fairness of the cross-examination of himself by Crown counsel, the admissibility of his criminal record at trial, and the admissibility of opinion evidence proved in the testimony of the Crown's expert witness on accident reconstruction. He also argues that the trial judge failed to find that the fact that the appellant was impaired at the time of the collision was the cause of the collision and that his conclusion was unreasonable and against the weight of the evidence. HELD: Appeal dismissed.  1) The trial judge has a discretion pursuant to R. v. Corbett, [1988] 1 S.C.R. 670, to exclude prejudicial evidence of prior convictions in an appropriate case. This discretion is exercised by the trial judge on the application of an accused at the close of the Crown's case. See R. v. Underwood, [1998] 1 S.C.R. 77. As such an application was not raised in this case, and the questioning about previous convictions by the Crown was not objected to when it occurred, and the issue of the appellant's previous alcohol related offences was raised in the appellant's own examination in chief, this court concludes that there is no basis for this Court to conclude that the cross-examination was inappropriate or that the evidence adduced was inadmissible.  2) It is not proper for Crown counsel to ask an accused on cross-examination to explain the testimony of a Crown witness, and that it is highly unfair and prejudicial to require an accused to agree with a Crown witness or stigmatize that witness as a 'liar'. Crown counsel should not have put these sorts of questions and the trial judge ought not to have permitted them. Defence counsel did not object to them. However, this Court is not satisfied that this error had any effect on the trial and this ground of appeal fails.  3) The Crown elicited opinion evidence from Constable Gibson in the area of accident reconstruction. No evidence was at any time offered as to his expertise to do so, other than his curriculum vitae, which was filed. This witness's evidence as to how the bodies might have moved in the vehicle in the course of the collision and its aftermath, and in particular, his conclusory opinion that Ms. McDermott was the passenger and Mr. Bear the driver, ought not to have been received in the absence of a ruling that he was qualified as an expert in relation to those matters, and that his expertise was necessary in relation to the subject matter of his testimony, and that his opinion was based on facts before the Court. 4) The appellant was charged and convicted with offences pursuant to s. 255(2) and s. 255(3) of the Criminal Code. The appellant argues that conviction requires that the appellant has been charged with an offence pursuant to s. 253(a). There is no merit in this ground of appeal. Impaired driving causing death and bodily harm are routinely charged in this manner. 5) This Court's review of the cross-examination of the appellant supports the trial judge's assessment of it as unbelievable. In light of the trial judge's findings of credibility, and the results of the DNA analysis of the samples taken, the evidence overwhelmingly supports the verdict reached by the trial judge that the appellant was driving. The conclusory opinions expressed by Constable Gibson in relation to the movements of the occupants in the truck, and as to who was driving the vehicle, played no meaningful role in a conclusion that was, compelled by the remaining evidence. Notwithstanding the errors apparent in the receipt of opinion evidence from Constable Gibson, there was no substantial miscarriage of justice. The appeal from conviction is dismissed. 6) The trial judge did not commit any error of principle in coming to the conclusion that an appropriate sentence was 6 years imprisonment. While the sentence is at the high end of the available range, it is not outside the range available in the circumstances of this case.","The appellant was convicted of operating a motor vehicle while his ability to operate the vehicle was impaired by alcohol, thereby causing the death of his passenger and causing bodily harm to the driver. The appellant argued that cross-examination by the Crown was improper and that the trial judge failed to find that the appellant was impaired at the time of the collision. Appeal dismissed; the appellant's evidence as to how the bodies might have moved within the vehicle in the course of the course Of The Course was not prejudicial; the trial Judge did not place any weight on the questioning about previous criminal convictions by the RCMP and the appellant had been given credit for time served on remand. The question of the appellant’s qualifications was not raised during the trial and was not asked during the appeal. The issue was whether the appellant or the driver of the truck was the driver at the relevant time."
d_2013skca10.txt,"The appellant plead guilty to two counts of sexual assault, was declared a dangerous offender and sentenced to an indeterminate sentence. The appellant appealed the sentence arguing that the sentencing judge failed to give adequate consideration to the assessment of two expert witnesses who testified that they thought the appellant should be found a long-term offender. HELD: The appeal was dismissed. The sentencing judge was not bound to accept the assessment of the experts. Both experts testified that the appellant's risk to reoffend sexually was moderate to high and was extremely high if he did not receive treatment. Both experts based their opinions, in part, on the idea that the appellant had been a model inmate. Both experts believed the appellant's self report about his behaviour in custody, despite having reached the conclusion that he was a pathological liar. Both experts appeared to take the accused at face value when he said he was motivated to change. In fact, the evidence from correctional officials suggested that the appellant was prone to violent, aggressive and irrational behaviour in custody. He had shown on numerous occasions that he would not follow the rules in the institution and had been involved in several attempts to smuggle drugs into the jail, including picking up a package in the washroom of the court house during his dangerous offender hearing and convincing his lawyer to bring his baby into the jail with drugs in his diaper. The accused had committed two sexual assaults within months of being released from a previous sexual assault sentence. The trial judge was correct to emphasize protection of the public and was entitled to discount the opinion of the experts because it was based on incorrect assumptions. In supporting the sentencing judge's opinion that the accused would not take treatment because he refused to accept responsibility for his offences, the Court of Appeal noted that the accused had stated in his Notice of Appeal that he was serving a life sentence for two sexual assaults that he did not commit and the fact that he sent a letter to the Court saying that he had been falsely accused and did not sexually assault anyone. In addition, the Court considered fresh evidence that the appellant had refused to transfer to another institution in order to participate in high-intensity sex offender treatment pending his appeal.","After the defendant pled guilty to two counts of sexual assault, the Court declared him a dangerous offender and sentenced him to an indeterminate sentence. The defendant appealed. He argued that during the dangerous offender hearing the judge failed to give adequate consideration to the assessment of two expert witnesses who both recommended that he be declared a long-term offender instead of a dangerous one. The Defendant argued that the Court was not bound to accept the assessment. The Court found that the Defendant had not shown the experts' that he was a pathological liar and that his risk for re-offending was substantial. The court also dismissed the defendant's contention that the high intensity sexual offender program could not succeed unless the defendant became compliant with his demands for information about his past sexual offences. The evidence established that the defendant had consistently refused to participate in the high- intensity sexual offenders program and had consistently stated that he did not intend to participate. The trial judge failed, in his assessment of the experts, to give appropriate consideration to their opinions. The judge failed by failing to give sufficient consideration to these two factors. The dangerous offender judge's view that the complainant was not willing to take treatment because he refused to accept responsibility for the sexual assaults was prophetic. The accused filed a notice of appeal stating that he would be doing a life sentence for two sexual assaults but would not participate in sexual offender treatment. He followed this up with a letter to the Court stating that if he ever had the chance to participate, he would not benefit from the program. The issue on appeal was whether the Court should impose a long term sentence because of the defendant’s persistent and persistent refusal to cooperate with the assessment and to take appropriate programming. The issues on appeal were the length of time that the program would take and the impact on the defendant. HELD: The appeal was dismissed. The sentencing judge was not required to give specific reasons for his decision. The reasons given were not focused on the specific reasons but rather on the reasons given by the Court."
d_2006nsca24.txt,"In the context of a divorce proceeding, the husband filed an interlocutory application for, inter alia, the termination of spousal support, and the sale of the matrimonial home. The Chambers judge ordered that the matrimonial home be sold and the assets equally divided between the spouses. The wife appealed. Appeal allowed; certain provisions of the Order struck or temporarily lifted to permit the parties a reasonable opportunity to make timely alternative arrangements to resolve the matters in issue consensually, short of selling the matrimonial home; the court's intervention was necessary to prevent a patent injustice. There was no mention of any division of matrimonial assets in the notice filed by the husband and in the unique circumstances of this case, it was unrealistic and unfair to address the issue of selling the house without at the same time taking into account its value and the parties' individual contributions to that value.","The husband applied to have the matrimonial home sold and ordered to return to the wife certain personal belongings. The wife had been cut off her social assistance disability benefits and was unable to obtain any further income until she started receiving old age security and CPP. She also wanted title to her house back. The matrimononial home was in poor condition and the husband was paying spousal support of $800 monthly. He wanted to stop paying support, to have her return to him certain personal items, and to have his name off the mortgage on the matonial home so that he could finance his acquisition of a new residence for himself and return certain other items. The husband applied for an interlocutory order that the home be sold and the matron home be divided equally. The mother appealed the Chambers judge's decision claiming a reversible error in his calculations. Appeal allowed; the matrionial home sale ordered immediate; the husband's application for an order to sell the home was dismissed with costs; the wife's application dismissed on an expedited basis; the judge's order that a sale of the matriconial home be ordered without delay or impediment was not the appropriate reaction. The court was satisfied that the judge had not erred in his considerations regarding the facts and the history of the case."
8_2007skqb419.txt,"In January 1992, the parties agreed the petitioner would pay child support of $300 per month and that it would be without tax ramifications to either party. As of September 2007, the petitioner has arrears of about $2,900. He now applies to set his child support obligation and deal with the arrears. The petitioner claims he has been paying too much in child support under the Guidelines. HELD: 1) In terms of ongoing support, it is appropriate to determine the petitioner's income on the basis of the three year average of his employment income being $21,834 and add to that the $5,100 in rental income for a total of $26,934. The petitioner is actively engaged in farming. He pursues reasonable off farm income. In the absence of something further, the Court was not prepared to impute income. He shall pay child support of $221 per month.  2) In terms of the payor's ability to pay at the time the arrears accrued, the petitioner says he was paying in excess of his legal obligation. It is true that if one looked to his employment income the table amount would be approximately half of the $300 per month non-taxable that the petitioner agreed to pay back in 1992. However, one cannot ignore the fact that he agreed to pay it. He did nothing to seek to change this obligation in all of the intervening years. The petitioner's farming operation affords the petitioner an opportunity to manage his financial affairs. By reporting a farm loss each year, the petitioner in fact pays less tax on his employment income than he would otherwise pay. In the circumstances the Court was not prepared to rescind any of the arrears.","FIAT: The petitioner seeks an interim order setting his ongoing child support obligation as well as addressing the arrears. The arrearages have accumulated and he seeks to expunge them. The petitioner is part of a family farm operation. He supplements his farm income with working for part of the season at a local sporting store. This generates some rental income. The respondent takes the position the petitioner's line 150 income does not reflect his ability to pay. HELD: 1) The child support order of December 11, 1991 was registered in this Court January 27, 1992 pursuant to s. of The Reciprocal Enforcement of Maintenance Orders Act, 1983. The Court was aware of the petitioner’s farming operation. It was cognizant of the fact that the petitioner affords the petitioner an opportunity to manage his financial affairs. By reporting a farm loss each year the petitioner pays less tax on his employment income than he would otherwise pay. Arrears have accumulated. In the circumstances the court was not prepared to rescind any of the arreears. 2) The petitioner was actively engaged in farming. He pursues reasonable off farm income. He indicated that he recently sought financing for a half ton truck he indicated his income was $5,100 per month. The farm loss was reported to the Maintenance Enforcement Office in 2007. 3) The respondent was aware the petitioner was paying at a rate that is greater than his legal obligation. Arreears have accrued and he is seeking to expune them. There is money sitting in the Maintenance enforcement office as a result of federal intercept.

2011skpc153.txt,The accused was charged with dangerous driving. The evidence established that the accused was observed driving a black Mustang that accelerated quickly from a red light. The police officer observed the vehicle accelerate over a period of two to three blocks and used radar to clock the vehicle's top speed at 140 km/hr. The posted speed limit is 60 km/hr. The intersection was near a church and school yard. There is a bend in the street near where this speeding occurred. HELD: The accused was convicted of dangerous driving. The accused was travelling well over twice the posted speed limit for that portion of roadway. The bend in the road adds to the danger. The accused was driving within the confines of a city and his actions were planned and deliberate. His conduct is a marked departure from the standard expected of a reasonably prudent driver.,"The accused was charged with operating a motor vehicle on a highway in a manner that was dangerous to the public contrary to s.249(1)(a) of the Criminal Code. The accused was stopped behind a police officer as he was approaching a controlled intersection. The officer locked in his vehicle at one hundred and forty kilometres an hour in a sixty kilometre zone and the accused accelerated substantially prior to the officer activating the emergency equipment. At this controlled intersection, there was no one else in the vehicle. There was no sound of traffic coming to a complete stop and the officer noted slight traffic flow. The vehicle was still accelerating and travelling greater than the posted speed limit. The police officer noted heavy traffic on the roadway and noted that there was one other vehicle close to the intersection. HELD: The accused's driving was a marked departure from the standard expected for reasonably prudent drivers. The mens rea was inferred from the driving conduct. The driver was charged and charged. The evidence was straightforward and uncontradicted. The only conclusion that the court could draw was that the accused voluntarily undertook to drive his vehicle and accelerate to this rate of speed was a'marked departure' from the Standard expected for a reasonably prudent driver. The driving must constitute a marked a departure from that standard expected in a reasonably- prudent driver such as the accused."
8_2008skqb481.txt,"FIAT: The applicant seeks an order setting aside a wage assessment certificate issued by the Director of the Labour Standards Branch (the Director) and filed with this Court. The applicant disputes liability for the amount set out in the wage assessment and claim that he inadvertently and innocently missed the time within which to file an appeal. The issues are whether this Court has jurisdiction to set aside the Director's certificate filed with the Court of Queen's Bench, if so what criteria ought to be applied in determining whether the Court should exercise its discretion and whether the applicant has satisfied the criteria. HELD: 1) Even though an appeal from a wage assessment to the appeals board and an appeal from an adjudicator to the Court of Queen's Bench both require 'appeals' within '21 days', an appeal to the Court of Queen's Bench is a true appeal while an 'appeal' to the appeals board is essentially a request for a de novo hearing. Consequently, this Court concludes that the consequences of missing the time limitation are not necessarily the same. 2) This Court does have jurisdiction to deal with an applicant's request, on a director appeal, because it is not a 'true appeal' that questions a decision made by an independent adjudicator after a hearing. Accordingly, the reasoning of this Court in Farmers of North America Inc. v. Langridge, 2004 SKQB 375, is not applicable. A finding that this Court is without jurisdiction to set aside a judgment, obtained without any independent adjudicative process, regardless of the basis upon which that judgment was obtained, is inequitable and at odds with existing practices and procedures. Section 62.4(4) of The Labour Standards Act states that a certificate filed pursuant to s. 62.4(3) has the same force and effect as if it were a judgment obtained in the Court of Queen's Bench for the recovery of a debt. This Court certainly would have jurisdiction to determine whether or not the applicant's application to open up a noting for default should be granted pursuant to Rule 114(3), Rule 271 and Rule 346. It follows that this Court is able to look behind the filing and examine the circumstances under which that judgment was entered. The Court of Queen's Bench is a superior Court charged with the administration of justice and enjoys inherent as well as statutory jurisdiction. This inherent jurisdiction cannot be removed by either level of government without constitutional amendment. 3) It is fair and equitable to apply, by analogy, the principles and resulting rules formulated relating to opening up a default judgment to the applicant's request to set aside the judgment registered in circumstances where he has failed to file an appeal disputing a wage assessment to the registrar of appeals.  4) The evidence is that the applicant is a businessman running a commercial enterprise in Foam Lake. It is expected that somebody in his position would have the savvy to read, review and understand the document, or at least seek assistance from someone who could help him. The applicant either failed or declined to read, or chose to ignore, the plain language of the documents served on him by registered mail. This amounts to wilful blindness at the very least. Numerous cases hold that wilful blindness is not sufficient reason to set aside a noting for default. In these circumstances the Court is not prepared to exercise its discretion in favour of setting aside the Director's certificate filed as a judgment of this Court.","FIAT: The applicant brings an application seeking an order setting aside a certificate issued by the Director of the Labour Standards Branch and filed with the Court of Queen's Bench. The applicant disputes liability for the amount set out in the wage assessment and claims that he inadvertently and innocently missed the time within which to file an appeal. HELD: The application is dismissed. 1) The certificate is properly issued as permitted by s. 62 of The Labour Standards Act. 2) There is no evidence before the Court that it has jurisdiction to set aside the certificate filed with Queen's Park. 3) The applicant has not satisfactorily explained why it was that he did not file the appeal within 21 days after receiving formal notice. The second criterion, which is to be how the certificate is set aside, is not applicable to these circumstances. 4) There are two bases upon which it can be found that it can reasonably be found the Court is clothed with jurisdiction to exercise its discretion and provide remedy in appropriate circumstances. 5) The Court does have jurisdiction to deal with an applicant's request, on a director appeal, because it is not a true appeal that questions a decision made by an independent adjudicator after a hearing. 6) There were at least two bases on which it could be found there was insufficient jurisdiction to grant the relief requested. The Court is without jurisdiction to open up a judgment, obtained without any independent adjudicative process, regardless of the basis upon which that judgment was obtained. However, in this case the Court has jurisdiction and provides remedy in the appropriate circumstances (see: Royal Bank v. Jenson, 1988 CanLII 4958). 7) The application for setting aside the director's certificate is dismissed because it was not a 'true appeal' that questions the decision made of an independent judge after a Hearing. 8) The Certificate is properly filed with a registrar of appeals and the Court accepts the conclusions and reasoning reached by Allbright J. in Farmers of North America. 9) The principles and considerations that flow from them and which have developed in relation to the opening up of noting for default and in setting aside default judgments ought not be disturbed. 10) The Director's certificate was properly issued. 11) The Applicant either declined to read, or chose to ignore, the plain language on the document.

In numerous cases wilful blameworthyness has been held to not constitute sufficient reason to set off a certificate. 12) The court has jurisdiction in the event of"
9_2008skca107.txt,"This appeal arises from a dispute between the appellant, Dr. Huerto and the respondent Government of Saskatchewan, over the payment for medical services provided by Dr. Huerto to his patients. Over a period of approximately 10 years, the Government withheld payment in relation to what eventually amounted to some 12,000 of the appellant's accounts. The Government indicated through the use of a billing code, that the accounts would not be paid until further information was provided. The appellant believed the use of the billing code was unlawful and chose not to provide additional information. He started an action in the Court of Queen's Bench to compel payment of his accounts. His claim was largely dismissed on the basis that the action was premature. The appellant appeals from the Queen's Bench ruling and the Government cross-appeal in relation to the limited aspect of the case in which Dr. Huerto enjoyed success. HELD: Appeal and Cross-appeal dismissed.  1) Section 17(1)(c) of The Saskatchewan Medical Care Insurance Act is to the effect that the intention and purpose of the Act is not to establish a medical care insurance plan under which 'the exercise of professional judgment by physicians is in any way diminished'. This broad statement of principle should not be read so aggressively as to mean the Government, as the payor in a publicly funded health care system, has no right to ask questions about the accounts presented for payment by physicians. The Government has not denied payment of the appellant's accounts. Nor has it received the requested information from the appellant. The actions (the Protocol) taken by the Government cannot be characterized as an amendment of the Payment Schedule. The Protocol is an administrative tool which sets out the situations in which the appellant will be asked for further information about the provision of specific services. This is fully in line with the terms of the Schedule. 2) Section 5(1) of the Regulations should not be read as meaning the Government is entitled to ask for additional information about a service if, and only if, the nature of the service is 'unusual'. Rather, it simply stipulates that additional remarks must be included in an account rendered with respect to an unusual service. This does not imply the government can request extra information only in relation to an unusual service. A physician's obligation to include certain material in an account and the Government's authority to ask for additional information are ultimately two quite different things. 3) The Court does not accept that the appellant's claims were barred by s. 16(1) of the Act. It would be perverse to read the Act as requiring that, in order for an account to be paid, every bit of information demanded by the Government through the use of a billing code, or otherwise, must be supplied before the expiration of the 6 month period established by the Regulations. An account submitted the day before the expiration of the 6 month deadline would be voided by the application of the billing code. An account submitted well in advance of the expiration of the 6 month period would also be effectively denied if a request for further information was not made until at or near the end of the six month time limit, with the result that there was insufficient time for a physician to respond before that limit was exceeded. These potential problems are especially troublesome because there is an element of subjectivity in the application of the Protocol and even the most diligent physician might not accurately anticipate when an account or accounts will attract a request for extra comment. 4) The Court cannot accept the Government's submission that the trial judge should have declined to deal with the appellant's claim because the appellant had not fully pursued possible appeals to the Medical assessment Board. The Legislature in s. 40(3) of the Act has expressly provided that the appeal procedure established pursuant to the Act does not prejudice a physician's right to pursue matters in the courts. It stands entirely at odds with the notion that the appeal procedures in the Act should be read as being comprehensive and exhaustive.","Dr. Huerto appealed from a Queen's Bench ruling regarding the Government's use of the billing code. The appellant argued that the Government had not attempted to regulate his practice by requiring the payment of ECGs and echocardiograms but had instead used a particular billing code which indicated in effect that the accounts would not be paid until further information was provided. The Government cross-appealed in relation to the limited aspect of the case in which Dr. Huerta enjoyed success at trial. Appeal dismissed; cross- appeal dismissed; the principles of the Protocol and the AU code in their respective versions are not inconsistent with s. 17(1)(c) of the MCIA. The principles of s. 18(2) of The Saskatchewan Medical Care Insurance Act, R.S.S., s. 29 (the Medical Professional Review Committee) and s. 5(1) of Health Canada do not provide an individualized administrative process. The Protocol is intended to provide that process to the Government, on behalf of the Government. However, it does not provide a mechanism by which the Government can request further information about the services covered by an account or, in appropriate situations, to deny payment of an account. The AU code is best characterized as an 'integral feature' of the payment regime and is best used to regulate a physician's pattern of practice. The payment schedule is best suited to deal with complicated accounts, which require a lengthy period of preparation and payment. The length of the delay in processing accounts is significant and it would be impossible for the Government to pay each and every physician a service that was paid in accordance with the physician's prescribed time period. The payments made on accounts by the physician were typically made within six months of the date of the service being provided. Although the claim was dismissed on the basis that the action was premature, the length of time it took to process accounts was significant and should be considered in light of the limited time period it would take to process the accounts. The claim was also premature as most accounts had not been submitted within six to five months of their first visit. The physician appealed from the trial judge's decision to award him damages in the amount of 30 percent of the billings for 16 accounts. HELD: Both the appeal and the cross-Appeal must be dismissed. 1) The principles and framework of the Payment Schedule set out the broad outline of the scheme that governs payment for physician services in Saskatchewan. 2) The Protocol and MCIA are best characterized by the use of"
4_2005nssc253.txt,"The plaintiff in a rear end motor vehicle accident applied for summary judgment and an interim payment. The defendant argued that there was an arguable issue to be tried in that even if one accepted the plaintiff's evidence, there was the issue of contributory negligence to be considered. The defendant also argued that he did not see any brake lights on the plaintiff's vehicle and thus there was an issue as to whether or not they were working. Application for summary judgment granted as to liability with damages to be assessed; application for interim payment dismissed. There was no 'air of reality' to the defence; to strike the plaintiff's vehicle from behind on these facts meant that the defendant was travelling too close or didn't have proper care or control of his vehicle. However, the affidavit evidence showed that there were several other factors affecting the plaintiff's health besides the injuries sustained in the motor vehicle accident; serious issues existed between the parties at to whether or not the plaintiff's injuries sustained in the motor vehicle accident resulted in any ongoing inability to work in any capacity; any amount of assessed damages which might be arrived at would largely depend upon credibility and the medical evidence at trial.","The Plaintiff applied for an order for summary judgment pursuant to Civil Procedure Rule 13.01 and an interim payment under Rule 31.01. The Plaintiff was operating her motor vehicle and said in her affidavit that she was struck from behind by the defendant. The defendant argued there were significant other factors that would contribute in significant way to her current health complaints. Application allowed; judgment entered against the defendant with damages to be assessed. Although there was an 'air of realty' to the defendant's argument, there was no 'air to reality' to it. The plaintiff was making a significant claim yet when one listened to defendant's counsel and read the material attached to his affidavit, one found there were numerous other factors affecting the health of the plaintiff. She was unable to establish the motor vehicle accident resulted in her suffering injuries. Judgement was entered against both parties.

d_2006nssc73.txt,"Custodial arrangements for the parties two youngest children (aged 15 and 13), who currently lived with the father the majority of the time, were at issue. The marriage had been traditional, with the wife being the primary caretaker of the children. Both children were heavily involved in sporting activities and the father felt that since he was retired, he would be better able to ensure their attendance at various games and practices. The mother, who had recently commenced employment as a social worker, felt that the current interim arrangement was difficult for the children in that they would forget their school books at the other parent's residence and were sometimes left alone for extended periods at the father's residence. Children placed in the custody and primary care of the mother; until the separation, the mother had been the primary caretaker of the children and she appeared to have a stronger emotional bond with them; the father had been physically, emotionally and verbally abusive to the wife throughout the marriage and seemed incapable of putting the children's needs above his own; and the mother was much more likely than the father to encourage the children to have contact with the other parent. Although the father was retired and might have more time to spend with the children, this did not outweigh all of the other factors.","The parties were married for four years and had four children. The petitioner had been employed as a truck driver for several years. He eventually retired from the federal government. They had four young children, two of whom were now in their 20s and one who was nearing completion of his university degree. The respondent was employed as an executive with the Department of Transport. He lived in the same apartment as the petitioner and had three children, aged fifteen and thirteen. The parties had difficulty communicating, often resulting in the petitioner having to travel to work and school. The petitioner was employed with the federal Department of Transportation. She worked part-time and lived in her apartment. She obtained a degree in social work and became a social worker. The court found that the children had a more stable and independent living situation than the petitioner, who lived with her mother when she was not attending university. The Court found that it would be in the children's best interests to be in their parent's care and to have them participate in activities that were in harmony with their natural habitat. The mother was to have primary care of the children for the duration of their marriage and the father would have primary access on a weekly basis. The father was to pay child support and child support in accordance with the terms of his employment contract. The wife was to take care of all four children, except for the younger children, who were to move to new apartment. The husband was to provide the primary care and care of three of the four children and the two younger children were to have access on the interim basis."
d_2000skqb366.txt,"The applicant sought an interlocutory injunction pursuant to s.65 of the Queen's Bench Act and Queen's Bench Rule 387(a) prohibiting and restraining the respondents from producing and manufacturing potassium sulphate near Alsask until further order; an order restraining the respondent from selling, marketing, or disposing of the potassium sulphate for profit until further order; other ancillary relief; costs of the application. HELD: The application was dismissed with costs to the respondents in any event of the cause. The applicant did not demonstrate an entitlement to injunctive relief on the second and third stages of the three stage test. The applicant demonstrated there was a serious question to be tried but failed to demonstrate it would suffer irreparable harm. The delay (the action was commenced February 16, 1998) was considered. On balance the respondents would suffer greater harm if the injunction were granted as the respondent Nylen makes his living marketing and selling potassium sulphate.",The plaintiff sought injunctive relief and an order prohibiting the defendant from marketing or selling potassium sulphate and restraining the defendants from having any contact with the plaintiff. The defendant had already entered into a technology licensing agreement with the defendant and had only obtained documentation in 1995 and 1996 that it could be used to produce potassium sulphates. The plaintiff alleged that the defendant had breached the terms of the Technology Licensing Agreement. The defendants denied that they had any relationship and asserted that they were only marketing potassium sulphide. HELD: The plaintiff was prohibited from marketing any potassium sulphated and from having its contact with any of the defendants. 1) The defendant was found to have a proprietary interest in the scientific principles of ion exchange and crystallization. Such was not the only technology licensed to the defendant by the defendant. 2) The plaintiff had already established a technology license with the defendants and had not obtained any assurances that the other technology was being used by the plaintiff that could even remotely be considered technology. The fact that the plaintiff had not established that the technology was the only one that could be considered technically advanced technology had no bearing on the defendant's claim that it had entered into the technology licensing agreements. The evidence established that Big Quill had already acquired the assets of the plaintiff and was not only the only source for such technology but also the only supplier of potassium sulphite to the plaintiff's needs. The court ordered further injunctions and ancillary relief ordered by way of injunction or otherwise as counsel may advise and the court may allow.

HELD: The application was dismissed with costs on double Column V. The Court is still of the view the proposed appellants would have little chance of success on appeal. Costs are a discretionary award and there was material on file upon which the trial judge could base his decision. The appellants failed to first apply to the trial judge to obtain leave to appeal as required by Queen's Bench Act s.38.,The proposed appellants applied to extend the time for filing a notice of appeal of a Court of Queen's Bench trial judge's order awarding costs to the proposed respondent jointly and personally. They propose to appeal essentially on the basis the award was punitive and inordinately high. The respondent has orally refused to grant the extension for the reason. Counsel for the proposed appellant advised the court the cost award was based on costs thrown away after the trial judge ordered a mistrial because of the prejudice caused by the proposed appellant's address to the jury. Counsel further advised the Court there was an affidavit filed before the Queen'sBench trial judge setting out the costs and expenses. HELD: The application was dismissed with costs on double column V. The parties had not taken out the order and thus had retained jurisdiction to decide the matter. Costs are a discretionary award and there was material on file upon which the trial Judge could base his decision.

The plaintiffs claim that Paxil is ineffective and harmful to persons under 18 years of age. The defendant applies for leave to cross-examine the representative plaintiff on his affidavit pursuant to Rule 317 of The Queen's Bench Rules. HELD: The decisions reviewed by the Court all support the view that leave to cross-examine under Rule 317 is granted more readily in proposed class actions than it is in other civil proceedings. None support the proposition that proposed representative plaintiff is immune from cross-examination in respect of his or her individual claim. Cross-examination of proposed representative plaintiff may explore matters pertaining to his or her individual claim in the context of issue that must be determined by the court pursuant to s. and s. 6.1 of The Class Actions Act.

HELD: The application for cross-examination is granted. The defendant's cross- examination is not permitted on its application. The court has a relatively wide discretion in relation to the requirement in ss. 6 and 6.1 of the Saskatchewan Act that a class action be the preferable procedure and that cross-exexamination will not result in an injustice to the respondent. The applicant has assured the court that the proposed cross--examination will be conducted at any reasonable location chosen by the applicant and plaintiffs' counsel and will not be in any way contrary to the affiant's personal expectations and motivation.

e_1991canlii4217.txt,"The plaintiff appealed the defendant's decision to grant a partial tax refund only under the Health Services Tax Act. The plaintiff had sought a full refund of tax paid on refrigeration equipment at a pickled herring plant (whose product was to be supplied on contract overseas) on the ground the equipment was used in the 'manufacture or production of goods for sale.' The contract stipulated that most of the processing occur at controlled cold temperatures. The defendant apportioned tax based on the time the equipment was used in the actual 'transformation or conversion' of the product. For the plaintiff, that (1) the tax exemption did not depend on the extent to which the equipment was used in the manufacturing process; and (2) since the contract required most of the process to occur under refrigeration, the use of a cold room was part of the 'manufacture or production' of the product.","Continental Seafoods applied for a refund of health services tax paid on refrigeration equipment which was installed in a new facility for pickled whole herring. The contract contained stringent quality specifications. The refrigeration unit was used to cool the pickled herring in a cooler facility for 28 to 45 days at a strictly controlled temperature of 0ºC to 2ºC. The applicant argued that the tax should not have been apportioned based on the use of the refrigeration facility. The Provincial Tax Commission advised Continental that the refund claim had been cancelled. Continental appealed. Appeal allowed; assessment for health services TA upheld. The respondent argued that there was new legislation in place that would allow a refund to be paid on equipment which were installed in new facility. He also argued that a 50% safety margin was appropriate, given the complexity of the problem. In issue was whether the tax paid should be refunded based upon the use or of the equipment in production."

The accused contended his right to be secure against unreasonable search and seizure as guaranteed by s.8 of the Charter and his right not to be arbitrarily detained or imprisoned as guaranteed by s.9 of the Charter were breached. In issue was whether the RCMP officer had the jurisdiction to carry out his duties as a peace officer in the City of Prince Albert; if so, was he acting in the lawful execution of his duties in conducting random stop. HELD: The accused was found guilty of driving with a blood alcohol level greater than .08. A judicial stay was entered in relation to the impaired count on which he would have been found guilty if it were necessary. 1)The language used by Parliament in the Royal Mounted Police Act is clear, broad and unambiguous as it was their obvious intention to create a police force that operates without jurisdictional barriers throughout the entire country of Canada. When there is a limitation on their duties it is clearly stated. The Police Act does not mention any exclusivity between one force and another. Given the ultra vires statute construction doctrine it would not be appropriate for provincial legislation to take away powers given by the Federal legislation. The Police Act must be read in context as providing a manner of funding policing not a manner of taking away jurisdiction granted to RCMP officers. 2)The law is now clear that the police can detain vehicles as long as they do so for the purposes of checking for sobriety, licences, ownership, insurance and other mechanical fitness of motor vehicles. The R. v. Emke decision is outdated. 3)The officer was acting in the lawful execution of his duty. There was no breach of the accused's rights under the Charter.","The accused was charged with two offences contrary to s. 255(1) and s. 253(a) of the Criminal Code and one for driving while impaired contrary to ss. 253 and 253(b) of that Code. The accused argued that his Charter rights were guaranteed by Section 21 of the Charter and that his right to be secure against unreasonable search and seizure guaranteed by s. 27(5) of The Highway Traffic Act. The police officer engaged in a search for open liquor in a marked police vehicle. The officer observed the vehicle displayed an out of date sticker on it's license plate in violation of S. 27 of the Highway Traffic act. The vehicle rolled off the curb, bounced off the sidewalk and into the street. The driver was seated in the police vehicle and blew 170 and 160 respectively on the breathalyser tests. The Crown argued that the words 'are assigned' refer to the three distinct objects and not to specific areas of jurisdiction. The defence argued that s. 24(2) ofThe Highway Traffic Law provides that a police officer is responsible for policing when there is an agreement between the province and federal government. The Saskatchewan Police Force is not responsible for providing policing policing when the province or federal government has exceeded its jurisdiction. HELD: The Saskatchewan police force was not responsible to operate in any specific geographic area and accordingly no appropriate legislation could be taken away from the police force.  1)The police officer was aware that the Saskatchewan Police Department had jurisdiction to search for illegal drugs and alcohol. The RCMP are not responsible in any particular geographic area for the purposes of policing. 2)The Saskatchewan Police force is not a policing force. There is no good public policy reason for the Saskatchewan police to be excluded from operating in any geographic area. 3)The Court concluded that the stopping of the police officer by a marked officer was a random stop and therefore not an infringement of s.27(5). The police force operates to render the police officers 'police officers for every part of Canada' with 'all the powers, authority, protection and privileges that a peace officer has by law' and there is nothing in the scheme or object of The Royal Canadian Mounted Police Act that derogates from that basic presumption. The Police Act must be read in its totality as providing a manner of funding policing not a manner to taking away jurisdiction granted to the RCMP officers by the Royal Canadian Crown Mounted police Act. 4)The stopping was a routine check and conducted within the context of a lawful execution of their duties.

2_2002nssc284.txt,"Following a four day trial, the plaintiffs were successful in the recovery of the sum of $29,150 against the defendant. Under the usual tariff, costs would be fixed at $4,725. The plaintiffs sought substantially increased costs on the basis that the defendant should have admitted liability at the outset rather than forcing the plaintiffs to trial. Solicitor and client fees totaled over $21,000. Costs fixed at $10,000 plus disbursements; there was no obligation on the defendant to admit liability but considering the amount of legal fees incurred in relation to the amount recovered, it was appropriate to go outside the tariffs.","Counsel had been unable to agree on costs after a four day trial. The plaintiffs were successful in recovering the base amount claimed but did not succeed in their claims for aggravated and punitive damages. The defendant should be substantially increased above the usual party and party costs because, as he contended, the trial extended over 4 days and it did not unduly prolong the proceeding. Costs should be calculated on the amount involved under Tariff A.  Costs awarded to the plaintiffs plus disbursements of $1,000 plus costs of $2,957.83 for a total of $21,663.48. This may appear to be a disproportionate amount of costs in view of the relatively moderate recovery rate the plaintiffs were experiencing. However, the plaintiffs are veterans of the bank's history and it was not an unreasonable amount of money to be expended to recover from a claim that was already being tried. The court found no fault on the part of the defendant in its conduct of the proceeding, which tended to shorten or unnecessarily lengthen the duration of the proceedings."

The Court's jurisdiction to make an order pursuant to s. 238(1) of the Income Tax Act is unaffected by a bankruptcy proceeding.","The respondent, who was an officer and director of the Halifax Regional Protection Services, received a Certificate of Discharge pursuant to the provisions of S.168.1 of the Bankruptcy and Insolvency Act, discharging and releasing him from all debts except matters referred to in s.178(1) of that Act. The Crown sought an order pursuant to s.238(2) of the Income Tax Act ordering the respondent to pay the sum of $22,069.23 to the Receiver General. At issue was whether the Crown has jurisdiction to issue an order under s. 238(2 of the Act ordering payment of the amount of $24,0699.23 or some part thereof by the respondent pursuant to S. 238 to the receiver general and if do, whether such an order should be made. HELD: The respondent was an employee and director at the company with another unnamed investor. He operated the company in bankruptcy proceedings and operated the subsidiary company with that investor. The defence submitted that the accountant and investor were officers, directors or shareholders in the company and that they held in H.R.P.S. a significant stream of income flowing into the company. The fact that the money was held in trust by the company was not a significant factor. The accountant and the investor were not officers, shareholders or shareholders. The evidence did not establish whether the accountant or investor held in the trust or the accountant held in common with the appellant. The court's jurisdiction to make an order for compliance pursuant to ss. 238 (2) is unaffected by the bankruptcy proceedings. The matter was adjourned to receive further submissions from counsel."
4_2017skqb205.txt,"Civil Procedure – Queen’s Bench Rules, Rule 3-72, Rule 3-84Statutes – Interpretation – Enforcement of Money Judgments Act, Section 5, Section 8 The proposed plaintiff, Alternatifbank (Abank) applied pursuant to Queen’s Bench rules 3-72 and 3-84 to be added as a plaintiff to the action of the plaintiff, Sekerbank, against the defendants and to amend the statement of claim. ABank asserted a debt claim against the defendants. The defendants applied pursuant to s. 8 of The Enforcement of Money Judgments Act (EMJA) to terminate the preservation order, which prohibited any dealings with 850,000 shares, or alternatively they sought an order reducing the number of shares subject to the order and requiring the plaintiff to post $3 million as security pursuant to s. 5(7) of the EMJA and $40,000 security for costs. Regarding ABank’s application, it argued that its claim in debt against the defendant arose out of the same transaction based on the allegation that Arslan transferred the shares to a trust (the other defendant was the trustee) in June 2013, the time at which he stopped paying his debts in full and thus denied it the opportunity to collect its debt. ABank sought the same relief as Sekerbank: judgment against both defendants under The Fraudulent Preferences Act and The Fraudulent Conveyances Act. The defendants argued that the limitation period that applied to ABank’s claim had expired and the application should be denied. Regarding the defendants’ application, they argued that the plaintiff’s strategy in the Saskatchewan action was to await the outcome of the proceedings they had initiated in Turkey against the plaintiff. The Saskatchewan action was independent from the Turkish action, and the plaintiff’s approach was unacceptable in the circumstances of the preservation order made against them in 2014. The plaintiff had not prosecuted its actions against them without delay as required by s. 5(c) of the EMJA. The defendants asserted that the share prices increased since 2014 and were now worth $18 million more than the plaintiff’s claim. If the preservation was not terminated, they requested that the number of shares be reduced to 100,000. HELD: The proposed plaintiff’s application was granted. The defendants’ application to terminate the preservation order or to reduce the number of shares subject to the order was dismissed. The court ordered the plaintiff to post $1 million as security under the EMJA and an additional $40,000 as security for costs. The court found that although the limitation period had expired, it would add ABank as a plaintiff and amend the statement of claim pursuant to s. 20 of The Limitations Act, because to do so would not create a wholly new proceeding and the defendants had not provided evidence that they would suffer prejudice. The preservation order was not terminated after the court reviewed the history of the proceedings in both Saskatchewan and Turkey and found that the plaintiff had not failed to prosecute its action without delay. The court found that there was insufficient evidence to justify the reduction in the number of shares subject to the order.  The information of the value of the security fell short of demonstrating a sufficient change in circumstances, especially in light of the addition of ABank’s claim. The court found that the order should be modified under s. 5(7) of the EMJA to have the plaintiff provide security because there was evidence that the trust may have suffered and could suffer losses in the future as a result of the order. The order for security for costs was justified based on the considerations specified in Queen’s Bench rule 4-24.","The defendants applied to terminate the preservation order and seek an order reducing the number of shares subject to the order and requiring the plaintiff to post $3,081,463.14 as security pursuant to ss. 5(7) of the EMJA and $40,000 security for costs. The first application was denied. The defendants sought amendments to the preservation orders to reduce the number on the order, reducing the amount of shares and requiring that the plaintiff post $5,08,463 as security for cost. The second application was granted in part. The purpose of the preservation Order was to prevent the defendants from engaging in a fraudulent preference and fraudulent conveyance action. The court found that neither of the defendants would suffer actual prejudice as a result of the proposed amendments. The only issue to be addressed was whether the two conditions specified in s. 5 of The Enforcement of Money Judgments Act (EMJA) were met. HELD: The appeal was dismissed. 1)The court exercised its discretion to order the plaintiff added as a plaintiff and to amend the statement of claim.  2)The EMJA requires a temporal and factual relationship between the occurrences on which the original claim is based and those on which a proposed counterclaim or similar claim is Based. The Court found that the EMAA has a temporal component and that neither the plaintiff nor the defendant will suffer actual prejudicial prejudice. The defendant's application to terminate or modify the order was based on the allegation that the plaintiffs failed to prosecute this action without delay. The addition of the plaintiff would not create a wholly new proceeding."
b_2007skqb388.txt,"The accused was found not guilty of having care or control of a motor vehicle while his blood alcohol content was over .08. The certificate of analysis was excluded as a result of the trial judge's decision that the accused's s. 8 Charter Rights had been violated. The trial judge found that the officer did not have reasonable and probable grounds to make the breathalyzer demand. HELD: The trial judge erred in determining that in the totality of the circumstances it was not objectively reasonable for the officer to have relied on the accuracy of the ASD test. A new trial is ordered.  1) There is no fixed rule or formula that an officer must follow when determining whether or not to wait 15 minutes prior to administering a road side test. In this case, the trial judge appears to have concluded that the officer who administered the ASD would not have relied on the results, or should not have so relied, if her partner had informed her of the empty beer can with fresh suds in it that he found at the scene. Implicit in this finding is the conclusion that the existence of the beer can would make a difference to the officer's assessment of whether she should wait 15 minutes for any mouth alcohol to dissipate before she could rely on ASD test results. 2) The trial judge made the same error that was dealt with by the Ontario Court of Appeal in R. v. Einarson. 3) The accused told the officer that he had been drinking in the car 'earlier'. Even if the officer had been told of her partner's discovery of an empty beer can at the scene, it would not constitute 'credible evidence' that the accused consumed alcohol within that 15 minute time frame. Whether or not the accused had consumed beer within 15 minutes of taking the test on the ASD is pure speculation.","The appellant was found not guilty of having care or control of a motor vehicle while his blood alcohol content was over.08. The trial judge found that contrary to s. 8 of the Charter, contrary to S. 8 being Schedule B to the Canada Act, 1982 the officer did not have reasonable and probable grounds to make the breathalyzer demand and further, that pursuant to s24(2) of the charter, the admission of the certificate of analysis could bring the administration of justice in disrepute. The Crown appeals both the trial judge's conclusions and the trial trial judge failed to articulate the analysis required for such a finding. HELD: The appeal is allowed and the acquittal set aside. The appeal was allowed and set aside with the acquittals set aside and the new trial held to be based on the correctness of the trial decision that the certificate analysis could not be tendered as evidence at trial. The evidence was not excluded from the evidence at the trial. 1) The trial court erred in determining in the totality of the circumstances it was not objectively reasonable for the officer to have relied on the accuracy of the ASD test. In so concluding, the trial court considered and relied upon R. v. Novakoski, 2004 SKPC 121 (ON SC), and Claypool, 2003 SKPC 116 (CanLII) and found that the trial judges erred by finding that in the circumstances the officer who administered the ASD would not have relied upon the results, or should not have, if the results had been found, and that under s. 24(2 of the Act the certificate was excluded from evidence. 2) The Court found that not all relevant evidence was assessed by the officer. The mere possibility that a driver has consumed alcohol within 15 minutes before taking the test on the ASD is pure speculation. Likewise, whether the wet ground near the driver's side of the vehicle was just urine is also speculation."
d_2013skqb394.txt,"HELD: The Court held that the replacement of former Queen’s Bench rule 212 requiring the production of documents “relating” to any matter in question and rule 222 permitting examination for discovery “touching” the matter in issue in the action by new rules 5-6, 5-18 and 5-25, which use the phrase: “relevant to any matter in issue”, showed the intention that the broad relevance test was no longer applicable. The test under the new Rules was whether the matter qualifies as being material to the action based upon the matter as pled and whether the evidence tends to prove or disprove the matter in issue. This inquiry must be balanced against the notion of proportionality set out in the foundational rules. The Court dismissed the application, excepting the requested order under 3) wherein the defendant would fulfill its undertaking to have certain employees provide responses. With respect to the rest of the relief requested under 1), which involved the undertaking that the defendant would search its records regarding the loading of railcars, the Court held that the as matter was not an issue in the action, based upon a review of the claim as pled. Having regard to proportionality under the new rules, the defendant should not be required to answer the question in light of the effort and expense required versus the possible benefits. The Court held that the plaintiffs were not entitled to ask the defendants to review a binder containing hundreds of pages of invoices assembled by the plaintiff regarding its expenditures incurred as a result of the derailment in order for it to advise the plaintiff which invoices the defendant believed were not related to it. It was the plaintiff’s burden to prove its damages and the defendant was not required to assist the plaintiff to do so. The plaintiff’s requested undertaking for the defendant to provide any background documents and information that went into the preparation of sketch of the railcar in question by the defendant’s adjuster was also denied. The adjuster’s file was subject to litigation privilege and unless it was tendered as evidence at trial, there was no implied waiver of that privilege. Regarding the plaintiff’s request in 2), the Court agreed with the defendants that that plaintiff’s request that the defendant answer questions now, rather than after it had completed questioning of the plaintiff, was premature. The defendant had not yet taken a position on the cause of the derailment and they would advise the plaintiff when they had developed one. Rule 5-31 makes it an ongoing obligation to correct answers and there was no evidence in this application that the rules had not been complied with. The Court awarded costs in the amount of $1,500 to the defendants due to the complexity of the application, requiring the submission of briefs of law and the amount of time taken to argue them matters in Chambers.","FIAT: The plaintiff, CN applied to the Court seeking orders that the defendants, Clarke Transport and Clarke Transport, answer certain questions which they refused to answer on discovery. The application raises interesting issues with respect to the proper scope of questioning or examination for discovery. HELD: 1) The Court found that when the Court moved from the words of touching and relating to any matter in issue, it intended to move away from the broad relevance test that existed under the former Queen's Bench Rules. 2) The application raised questions about the proper amount of time and expense necessary to investigate the cause of the derailment and to provide proper answers. 3) The plaintiff was not required to answer specific questions but was obliged to provide answers which were within the scope of the scope. 4) The applicant's refusal to provide specific responses was justified. 5) It is clear that the insurance adjuster's file would be subject to a litigation privilege.  6) The court found that the application to tender the sketch as evidence at trial was premature and unnecessary. The approach taken here of presenting several hundred pages of invoices and other documents and asking the defendant to advise which they say relate and do not relate to the derailments is of such nature and scale that it is not appropriate. The plaintiff is not required or required to do so. The defendant is not obliged to assist the plaintiff to do that. 7) The claim is not premature. The Court awarded costs of $1,500 to the applicant in any event of the cause."

The basis of the application is that the parties participated in a Collaborative Law process whereby it is alleged that Mr. Therrien alleged that confidential information was shared. The applicant submits that it would be a conflict of interest for the solicitor, who has been retained by the applicant, to continue to represent her, as the issues have not been settled. The collaborative law process encourages private and confidential information to be shared at meetings with clients and lawyers, whether or not that information is shareable in court process. The information was not included in the contract which was signed by the applicants. The Collaborative law process encouraged private and sensitive information to being shared at the meetings, whether by a lawyer or a client. The confidential information did not resolve the conflicts. The only way to resolve the conflict would be by holding a viva voce hearing. The parties agreed that the only way was to have the lawyer withdraw as counsel, so the parties may proceed to a pre-trial and a trial if necessary on the issues. HELD: The application is granted.

The plaintiff asserts he is involved in Union related litigation and is thus entitled to the benefit of the indemnity clause. HELD: The plaintiff's application for summary judgment is dismissed. The within action is dismissed in full. 1) The essential nature of the debate between the plaintiff and the Union relates to the interpretation of the indemnity clause in the Union bylaws. This is precisely the type of internal dispute that is not within the exclusive realm of the Labour Relations Board. The forum for this contest is the Queen's Bench Court and this Court has jurisdiction to entertain his claim under Queen's Bench Rule 485 for summary judgment. 2) The plaintiff represents himself. He has incurred no legal fees, other than disbursements, but he nonetheless asserts that he is entitled to $50,000. The figure of $50,000 is proffered by the plaintiff as an appropriate sum as he expects the defendant has spent at least that much defending all four actions. 3) It is plain and obvious that the plaintiff's claim is grounded on an interpretation of the indemnity clause that is so illogical and inconsistent with its plain wording that it cannot succeed. The plaintiff's claim for reimbursement of costs not incurred is equally incapable of success.","The plaintiff commenced an action against the union for breach of its by-laws.

The parties agreed that the Union was a voluntary association and was entitled to the benefit of the indemnity clause. The dispute was analogous to an internecine dispute in a voluntary sports organization respecting the disciplining of high school coach over recruiting practices. The essential nature of the debate between the union and the union relates to the interpretation of the liability by-laws. The forum for this contest is the Queen's Bench Court. Accordingly, the Court has jurisdiction to entertain the plaintiff's claim and his application under Queen's Rule 485 for summary judgment.

The Court of Appeal sought guidance from the Court of Queen”s Bench in McNairn v. Canadian Union of Public Employees (CUPE) and found that the Court had jurisdiction to hear the plaintiff” s claim and its application for Summary judgment. The court noted that the dispute was indistinguishable from the dispute in McNairyn because the plaintiff was involved in Union related litigation and was thus entitled to benefit of an indemnity by-Laws."
7_1998canlii2924.txt,"The accused was charged with first degree murder. Prior to jury selection, he applied for a stay of proceedings, alleging that there had been a breach of his right to a fair trial due to negative pre-trial publicity. Dismissing the application, that the application was premature. However, the accused would be permitted to challenge potential jurors for cause due to the highly prejudicial and inflammatory pre-trial media reports.","The accused, who was charged with the murder of his former residents, applied for a stay of proceedings alleging that his rights under s.11(d) and s. 11(f) of the Charter had been infringed due to the pre-trial publicity. The accused argued that the pre -trial publicity had prejudiced his right to be tried by an impartial jury of his peers. There was no evidence before the Court on the merits of the case as the trial had yet to begin. HELD: The application for a stayed of proceedings was dismissed. 1)The pre- trial publicity had not in any way prejudiced the accused's right to a fair trial by an unbiased jury. It was only at the stage that the prejudicial and inflammatory information was being gushed about which the Court would have to intervene. 2)The applicant had not established that his right was violated on a balance of probabilities. The pre--trial media coverage, which had been sensational and inflammatory by focussing on the security arrangements presently in place, was not sufficient to prevent juror bias. 3)The Court was satisfied that the Pre-trial Press coverage had created a 'feeling of fear and terror' among the accused and his potential jurors. It would be impossible for an impartial juror to be selected based on the prejudicicial information. 4)The application for stay of Proceedings based on prejudicial pre-sentence publicity was dismissed on the basis that challenges for cause were desirable. 5)The court was satisfied the pre pre-judicial publicity had created an atmosphere of fear, terror and uncertainty which made the selection of an impartial Jury impossible."

HELD: The accused are sentenced to 40 months imprisonment for the offence of robbery with violence and 4 months consecutive for the offence of having their faces masked. Having regard for the fact that the accused have been in custody for nearly 10 months, the Court gives them two for one credit for time served in remand which is 20 months. The sentence is 2 years to be served in a federal penitentiary. The sentence takes into consideration their lengthy record of offences committed as young offenders, the gravity of the offence, the violence used against the victim, the fact that a high speed chase ensued in the city, and the need to deter not only these accused but other who might consider committing the offence of robbery.","The accuseds, both 19 years of age, were convicted after trial of committing two offences, namely, with intent to commit an indictable offence and using violence against a police officer. The accuseds' criminal records were appalling. Most of the offences were committed when they were youth. The charges which resulted in the sentences being varied based on the accused's youth record, the gravity of the offence, the violence against the victim, the fact that a high speed chase ensued, and the need to deter not only these individuals but also anyone else who might consider committing the offence of robbery. The offences were crimes committed against a person in a vulnerable position. The youth had been in custody since January 31, 2007 and had been involved in numerous armed robberies. The Crown sought to have the accuseds sentenced to more than two years in prison, plus time served on remand. The Court of Appeal made an order prohibiting both the accused from possessing any firearm, cross bow, prohibited weapon, restricted weapon, prohibited device, ammunition and explosive substance during the period that began on this day and ended on January 31/2007 and was equivalent to more that 1 year of time served in a federal penitentiary. The sentences were varied based upon the factors set out in s. 718 of the Code. HELD: 1) The Court found that the accused had a fairly significant record which included convictions for offences against the person, against property and against the administration of law and justice. The range of sentences was such that years was at the lower end of the scale for an offence of this nature. 2) The accused's criminal records showed failure to respond to progressively longer and more restrictive sentences. The sentence which each of them will serve from this date is 2 years to be served in A federal penultimate penitentium. The victim surcharge was waived in respect of each of the accused.  3) The sentences of four years, one for one credit for time served at the end of remand were equivalent to 2 years in addition to time served by the Crown in the community. The total of these sentences is 44 months. The court gave each of these two credit for 1 credit for Time served on a remand of 20 months."
6_2011nssc48.txt,"The two plaintiffs were forced to jump from the window of their third-floor apartment after a fire erupted in the building. The fire alarm system was not functioning and, despite being aware of previous problems with the 25-year-old system, the defendant had never maintained or inspected it; the self-closing hallway fire doors were continually in an open position; the battery-operated fire alarm in the plaintiffs' apartment was not functioning; and the plaintiffs were unaware of whether their smoke detector was wired into the building or was their responsibility. The male plaintiff suffered serious fractures to both ankles and a fractured fibula. He underwent four surgeries, was non-weight bearing for three months and was unable to run or engage in various sports. Although he had returned to work as a production worker, his condition would continue to deteriorate due to post-traumatic arthritis, most likely resulting in a future ankle fusion. The female plaintiff suffered a pelvic ring injury with bilateral pelvic and sacral fractures, a fractured elbow and a broken rib. She underwent surgery on her pelvis, was unable to look after her own hygiene for five months and developed bursitis in the hip. She continued to experience pain in the tailbone with extensive sitting and in the elbow with extension of the arm, had a permanent loss of elbow extension and walked with a limp. The worsening of her pre-existing anxiety and depression led to the diagnosis of post-traumatic stress disorder. The landlord argued that the plaintiffs' injuries had not been caused by any of its actions. Male plaintiff awarded the sum of $75,000 for general damages, $15,000 for past and future loss of valuable services and $45,000 for loss of earning capacity; female plaintiff awarded the sum of $55,000 for general damages, $35,000 for past and future loss of valuable services and $75,000 for future loss of income. Although there was no evidence that the defendant was responsible for the fire, its conduct created an unreasonable risk of harm in the event of a fire. Without evidence as to how much time the plaintiffs would have had to escape down the stairwell or how long they would have had to wait for the fire department had the smoke or fire alarms activated, the 'material contribution' test was applied to the causation issue. When the plaintiffs first awoke, the fire had already worked its way up through the attic hatch to the roof, where the flames in the eaves were visible to the plaintiffs. Smoke and fire were able to flow freely through the adjacent stairwell as a result of the fire door being left open, and the failure of the smoke detectors and fire alarms allowed the smoke and fire to progress before being detected by the plaintiffs. The female plaintiff was found to have no meaningful residual earning capacity due to the combination of her physical and psychological injuries.","The plaintiff and her partner were in an apartment building when the fire broke out. The plaintiff fell from the building's third floor stairwell and suffered serious injuries. The defendant acknowledged that the hallway doors on the third floor were always open and the fire alarm system was not functioning at the time of the fire. The fire alarm was not working at the relevant time and the plaintiff's fire alarm had to be manually operated. The smoke detector was not functional at the correct time and there were problems with the fire engine system not functioning prior to the fire which was known to the defendant's supervisor. The problems with fire alarm and smoke detectors resulted in the failure to provide the benefit of warning of the existence of smoke and/or fire in the building. As a result, the defendant breached the standard of care owed to the plaintiffs. Liability and damages were at issue in this case. The defendants were found to have breached the common law duty of care by failing to maintain an operational fire alarm, fail to detect smoke detectors, and have failed to maintain a fire alarm that was not malfunctioning at the appropriate time. The plaintiffs suffered damages but denied they were caused by any act or omission by the defendant."
6_1997canlii9949.txt,The applicant sought an order requesting an absolute order of discharge in bankruptcy. The bankrupt was indebted to Canada Student Loans and Saskatchewan Student Loans. He had obtained a Bachelor of Science degree but was unable to complete his final year of Veterinary Medicine because he had received the maximum amount of financing available. The bankrupt had been employed for 5 years as a taxi driver earning a less than average income; he lived at home with his parents; he was single with no dependents. He was reluctant to leave secure employment in an effort to obtain employment related to his educational qualifications. Counsel for the objecting creditor argued that the bankrupt had a minimal income and had the capacity to make small payments toward his obligation. HELD: An absolute order of discharge was granted in accordance with the principles of The Bankruptcy and Insolvency Act.,"The bankrupt obtained a Bachelor of Science degree in Chemistry and an Advanced Certificate in Science-Physio as a result of student loan funding. He was indebted to Canada Student Loans in the amount of $22,338.99 and Saskatchewan student loans in the amounts of $18,241.39. The Saskatchewan program objected to the automatic discharge of the bankrupt. HELD: After carefully considering the submissions and bearing in mind the objects and principles of the Bankruptcy and Insolvency Act, an absolute order of discharge is appropriate. 1)The bankrupt is just shy of his 30th birthday. He is living at home and working and living at a home and is paying very reasonable rent and food expenses. He has been trying to find a degree for the past 3 years. While he is not impressed with the bankrupt's attitude, it would be futile to impose a conditional order of discharged in this situation due to the bankrupts low income. The bankrupt is obviously very intelligent and capable individual. sincerely hope he finds a way to complete his degree in veterinary medicine at some point in the future. 2)The university's student loans represent 100% of the provable claims of unsecured creditors. The university paid a total of $6,074.92 toward his Saskatchewan loan between November 1994 and April 1996. 3)Student loans represent a 100% share of the unsecvencured creditors' provable claim. The student loans account for 100%of the provables of unrepresented creditors. To his credit the bankrupt paid a grand total of approximately $6 million toward his student loans between November 1993 and April 1995. He earned $22.99 per year. He also successfully completed his veterinary medicine degree in 1996. 4)The court found that the bankrupt was entitled to an absolute or conditional order for discharge as he was of a certain income."
2_2005skpc39.txt,"The accused is charged with driving while over .08 contrary to s. 255(1) and s. 253(a) of the Criminal Code and impaired driving contrary to s. s. 253(b) and 255(1) of the Code. HELD: The accused is not guilty on all counts.  1) A breath test and demand should be made as soon as the officer forms the requisite grounds for making it. Those grounds did not change between the time the accused refused to provide an ASD sample at 8:17 a.m., when the officer arrested her for impaired driving and 8:40 a.m. when the officer read the accused the breathalyzer demand. There was no reason for the breath demand not being made forthwith. The rights of the accused under s. 8 and s. 9 of the Charter were breached. 2) The officer did not have reasonable and probable grounds for making the breathalyzer demand. The officer testified she gave the ASD demand to find out if the accused had alcohol in her system. When the accused refused, the officer arrested her for impaired driving. The officer was unsure of whether the accused had alcohol in her system when she read the accused the ASD demand and there was no new evidence gathered between 8:17 a.m. and 8:40 a.m. to justify the breath demand. The evidence does not support a subjective honest belief on the part of the officer that the ability of the accused to operate a motor vehicle was impaired by alcohol. As the breath sample evidence was obtained as a consequence of the breach of the s. 8 and s. 9 Charter rights of the accused, it should be excluded from evidence pursuant to s. 24(2).  3) The accused testified that she had been drinking alcohol and was feeling the effects of the alcohol at the time she was operating the vehicle. She said she knew the alcohol would kick in and that she was not really feeling the effects until she arrived at the police station. She offered an explanation for her difficulty in driving testifying that she was tired. The evidence of the officer, which was insufficient to support a belief of impairment as a prerequisite to a breath demand, cannot prove impaired driving. There is insufficient evidence to conclude beyond a reasonable doubt that the accused's ability to drive was impaired by alcohol at the time she was driving.","The accused was charged with two counts of impaired driving. The accused was found not guilty of the first count as there was no evidence before the Court of the undertaking alleged in Counts 1 and 2. The evidence of the officer was insufficient to support a belief of impairment as prerequisite to a breath demand and the accused's blood alcohol content exceeded 80 milligrams of alcohol in 100 millilitres of blood. HELD: The accused's guilty plea was not supported by a subjective honest belief on the part of the police officer that the accused was impaired by alcohol. The officer did not have reasonable and probable grounds for making the breathalyzer demand and there was nothing new evidence gathered between 8:17 a.m. and 8:45 a.M. to justify the breath demand. The case did not support a subjective belief on a part of police officer as to whether the accused had alcohol in her system when she read the accused demand and as there were no new evidence gathering between 8.17 a.m. to defend the breath sample demand and 8.45 a.M. on the breath breath demand, the evidence did not show a subjective expectation on the officer that she was impaired."
2_2009skpc71.txt,"Mr. Kenny is charged under The Wildlife Act Regulations, 1981 with use of a searchlight when hunting. Specifically, the section reads: 11.1(2) For the purpose of ensuring the safety of hunters and the public, a searchlight shall not be used for the purposes of hunting wildlife. The case was decided on the basis of credibility. The Court reviewed the requirements for assessing credibility and found it did not believe the accused. The Court stated that, on all the evidence, it was convinced beyond a reasonable doubt that the accused was using a searchlight for the purpose of hunting wildlife. HELD: The accused is guilty as charged.","The defendant was charged under The Wildlife Act Regulations, 1981 with the use of a searchlight when hunting. The defendant was found guilty of the charge. The searchlight was not used for the purposes of hunting. All three occupants of the vehicle were seated next to 30-30 rifles, one of which had one live round in the chamber, four live rounds in the magazine, and one of the two rifles that were seized. The driver and passenger were seated in the back seat of the truck with their two sons. One of the boys was seated next the driver as the driver used it as a spotlight and the other a bird and animal caller. The vehicle was under surveillance on continuous and ongoing basis for approximately 30 minutes. The RCMP were called to the scene of the accident. The Defendant acknowledged that he had been looking for the injured moose earlier in the day but admitted that he was late for work. The officer who pulled the defendant over testified that he thought the moose had been attacked by him earlier in day and was seriously hurt. The defence argued that the defendant was using the spotlight to get a 'light' and that he did not intend to shoot the mooses. The Court held that the first thought that would come to his mind, when he picked the boys up, was that there had been a moose in the area and that they had fallen asleep within minutes of getting into the truck. The second thought that should have crossed his mind but was not, as he said, done in the dark. The first thought, when the first came to his head, was whether the moos had been hurt by a person from his home area. The Crown did not accept the explanation offered by the defendant that he used the spotlight for the purpose of hunting wildlife. There were some uncontroverted facts, all of which were consistent only with an inescapable inference that the applicant was employing the searchlight for the sake of hunting and wildlife. The terms 'hunting' and 'wildlife' are all defined in the Act or Regulations. The phrase 'hunted' and “wildlife’ are all within the meaning of the Act. The purpose of the search was to search for wildlife and to obtain information about its inhabitants. The applicant was prohibited from hunting in any manner other than hunting in the context of the day and evening."
b_1999skqb39.txt,HELD: The grandparents were granted access one Saturday every second month from 10:00 a.m. to 4:00 p.m. It would be in the best interests of the child to have some ongoing relationship with both his maternal and paternal grandparents. The father lived in Alberta and may not be able to exercise the degree of access he was seeking. The relationships were separate with unique characteristics.,"The paternal grandparents sought an order granting them access to their grandson R.D.G., born December 1995 pursuant to s. 6.1(1) of the Children's Law Act, 1997. The applicant paternal grandparents opposed the access and suggested that any access being exercised by the applicants should be exercised during the access periods granted to their son P.J.B. As their son does not reside in Saskatchewan but rather in Alberta, am of the view that P. J.B.'s access may well not be able to exercise the degree of access which he seeks or indeed has been granted by this Court in fiat being released concurrently with this one. HELD: The paternal grandparents were to be granted access to R. D.G. one Saturday every two months. The access was to be less frequent than that which would be granted to the child's father. The provision in the order to fix the access period for two months was made in order to protect the best interests of the child in terms of access to him."
3_2005nssc122.txt,"The 23 year old defendant pled guilty to two counts of breaking and entering a dwelling house and one count of breaking and entering a shed. He cooperated with the police and provided evidence against his co-accused. He had a previous criminal record, which included convictions for mischief, theft, break and enter, breach of an undertaking and possession of stolen goods. Defendant sentenced to four years imprisonment; in assessing the appropriate sentence, the court allowed a credit for time already served (which was served virtually throughout in protective custody), a credit of 25% for the fact that the defendant had pled guilty and a further reduction of one and a half years for the defendant's assistance in pursuing the successful prosecution of his co-accused.","The accused, who was charged with aggravated assault, broke into two residences and stole property including a metal pipe. He also entered into plea agreements with the co-accused and others who had broken into others' residences and taken property including money and drugs. The accused plead guilty to one count of breaking and entering after he had already spent time in custody. The other count he entered guilty of was theft of property under s. 348(1)(e) of the Criminal Code. The Crown sought a sentence of four years imprisonment, eight months of imprisonment and a life imprisonment prohibition, plus the possibility of parole. The co-occused who had been charged with the theft pleaded guilty to three counts of breaking, entering and stealing property. The sentences were based on the factors set out in the Code. HELD: The appropriate sentence was a term of four-and-a-half years imprisonment with terms of probation and parole. Counsel for the Crown were satisfied that the sentence was appropriate given the circumstances. The aggravating circumstances of the offences were the accused's residence and the fact that he had a Grade X education and that he was working as a labourer at the time of the offence. The evidence showed that the accused had less than perfect upbringing and had a fair amount of instability. The offences were committed in a manner that was consistent with the pattern of common law breaking and theft. The defendant's co-operation and cooperation with the police was appreciated. The sentence of imprisonment was appropriate considering the co -accused had a previous record for mischief and the sentences imposed were similar to those for similar offences committed in similar circumstances."
7_2007skqb28.txt,"The respondent was charged with impaired driving contrary to s. 253(a) of the Criminal Code and driving while over .08, contrary to s. 253(b) of the Code. The Crown appeals the acquittal on the charge under s. 253(b) of the Code. At trial the Crown argued that, prior to searching the vehicle and having close contact with the accused in the police car, the RCMP officer did not have a reasonable suspicion that he had alcohol in his body and therefore did not make a screening device demand immediately. On appeal the Crown submits that the trial judge accepted this and therefore there was no unlawful detention and the lapse of 17 minutes from the time he was placed in the back of the police vehicle until a demand was made. The Crown submits that the trial judge was in error in concluding that the 17 minute delay was not warranted or necessary and that there was no breach of the accused's right to be free of arbitrary detention within the meaning of s. 9 of the Charter. HELD: The appeal is dismissed. It appears that the officer may have been anxious to search the vehicle in anticipation that more than just a charge of impaired driving could be supported. Had he proceeded with a quick search of the vehicle and then proceeded with the demand in a short time period that may have been a reasonable violation of the accused's Charter rights. It is obvious from the evidence that in the course of searching the vehicle, the police officer returned to the police vehicle where the accused was detained and he had a further conversation with him, following which he returned to continue his search of the vehicle. In the circumstances, the delay of 17 minutes from when the police officer should have made the demand but did not and detained the accused in the locked police vehicle while he conducted a search of the accused's vehicle without arresting him, advising him of his rights and conducting a search of his vehicle is a violation of potentially three separate Charter rights. The evidence of the subsequent breathalyzer and certificate of analysis is conscriptive evidence obtained following the breach of the accused's Charter rights and the trial judge properly ruled that pursuant to s. 24(2) of the Charter the evidence should be excluded and the charge dismissed.","The accused was charged with impaired driving contrary to s. 253(a) and driving while over.08 contrary to ss. 253B of the Criminal Code. The Crown appealed the acquittal on the charge under s.253(b) of the Code. HELD: The Court held that the delay between the time the police officer was stopped and when the roadside screening demand was made took the demand outside of the 'forthwith' requirement of s. 254(2) of The Alcohol and Gaming Regulation Act. The delay of 17 minutes from when the police should have made the demand but did not and detained Shire in the locked police vehicle while he was detained for 17 minutes while the police conducted a search of Shire's vehicle without arresting him, advising him of his rights and conducting a search without arresting or advising him, his rights, and his counsel were not breached. The evidence obtained from the breathalyzer and the certificate of analysis was conscriptive evidence obtained following the breach of Shires Charter rights. The charge was dismissed. 1)The delay of approximately 17 minutes was caused by the police vehicle being searched at the side of the road. During the 17 minutes delay, the officer noted an odour of alcohol and noticed a smell of alcohol. He assumed that the whisky bottle was on the floor behind the driver's seat. The officer believed that he would be issuing a ticket under The Alcohol & Gaming Regulation act. However, what the officer did was have Shire wait in the police car because the search was being conducted at the roadside side of road. Once he was placed in the vehicle, he was locked in it and he could not exit. The accused was taken to Carlyle detachment where he provided two samples of breath. 2)The Court held in its reasons that the officer ought to have had a reasonable suspicion of impaired driving and therefore did not make a screening device demand immediately. The Court also held that because the accused was locked into the vehicle and there was no delay in the investigation, the demand was not made against his Charter rights which is justifiable if there is no undue delay. 3)The accused's detention was not arbitrary because the police had a specific lawful purpose for stopping the vehicle. The detention of ShIRE was reasonable and he did not obstruct the police officers in their investigation. The police officer chose to have Shires wait in his vehicle while they conducted a vehicle search without arrest or advising the officer of his right to retain and instruct counsel and conducting warrantless search of his vehicle is a violation of his"
2_2008nssm16.txt,"The claimant purchaser brought an action for breach of contract and negligent misrepresentation, claiming that although the defendant vendors had advised her that there had been some damage to the chimney base in the residence, she had been told that this was a minor problem which was under repair and she had not been properly advised of a history of repeated flooding.  Following the purchase of the property, the claimant had commenced renovations and discovered extensive mould or rot throughout the basement, to such an extent that the entire basement had to be gutted, disinfected and rebuilt. She also claimed that a buried cistern was discovered in the backyard, which had been partly filled with earth but still filled up with rainwater and melted snow, and that the water had nowhere else to go but against the foundation. When the defendants brought a motion for non-suit at the conclusion of her case, the unrepresented claimant expressed surprise and dismay that her case could be dismissed before both sides had testified as she expected her remaining evidence to come out through the defendants' testimony. Motion granted; the claim against the defendants is dismissed; it is the responsibility of the buyer to verify the accuracy of the Property Condition Disclosure Statement (PCDS) and, in this case, the claimant had made no inquiry as to the statements made by the defendants of structural problems or unrepaired damage or leakage in the foundation. The claimant had notification, both in the PCDS and from her home inspector, that there were leakage problems in the basement and the inspection report had advised her of the need to make further enquiries. There was no evidence the latent defects (the cracks in the wall, the mould and the rotten wood) were visible to the defendants when they occupied the home, that there was continual leakage of which the defendants were aware or that the defendants had performed any repairs to the home during their occupancy to cover up the wood rot. Although there was evidence that the defendants were aware of the cistern and had not disclosed this to the claimant, there was no evidence to conclude that the cistern was causing the problem.","The claimant claimed damages for a house sale because the disclosure statement did not disclose a history of repeated flooding. The claimant alleged that the respondent sold the property to the claimant for $25,000 and that the disclosure did not include any references to the past. The respondent admitted that he had researched the property and knew of it prior to the purchase, but did not know of its history. The plaintiff alleged that he was being asked to use the service of a shop vac when the stairs to the main floor were flooded. The shop vac was found to be in poor condition. The damage was to the storeroom, which was under repair and was now in the condition of the house. The basement flooded on at least one occasion. The Claimant alleged the Defendants breached their contract by misrepresentation in the Property Condition Disclosure Statement. The parties were both required to pay the claimant's legal costs. The court dismissed the motion for non-suit. It is necessary to allow the parties to present all the facts that can be proven in a court of law, including the history of repeat flooding. There is no law limiting the ability of a person to make a claim in a small business. There was no evidence that the vendors' knowledge of the state of the premises was negligently induced. The evidence presented by the vendors was sufficient to support the claim. The caveat emptor rule was circumvented and the court found that the statements made by the sellers were mere representations. The Court held that it was not the decision maker's role to tell the litigants who they should call as witnesses or to provide evidence to support their case. The only conclusion drawn was that the speakers' remarks were deliberately misleading and did not raise any appropriate issues for the court to consider. The Small Claims Court did not allow the submissions either because the proponent's evidence disclosed a historyof repeated flooding but because the speakers at the hearing did not have legal training or were unable to show the Court was aware of the history."
e_1999canlii6888.txt,"The plaintiffs sued based on a contract between the parties that required the defendant to share the proceeds of milk quota sales. The defendant took the position that the contract only required the sharing of fluid milk quota sales, and not all milk quota sales. The plaintiff sought rectification of the contract to change the wording of the contract to milk quota sales from fluid milk quota sales. Finding for the plaintiff and granting rectification, that the parties clearly intended to have the contract cover all milk quota sales. The proceeds from all sales are to be divided between the parties.","The plaintiffs sought rectification of the agreement terms in regard to the sharing by all three of them in the proceeds from any sales of milk quota by the defendant. The defendant had sold some of the plaintiff's dairy assets under a previous quota system. The plaintiff had been involved in the negotiations leading up to the reorganization of the parent company. The agreement provided that the three brothers would each have their own business, with the exception of one being the plaintiff who would own the rest and be entitled to a share. The court found that the agreement only referred to the plaintiff’s dairy assets and that it was obligated to only share proceeds from the sale of the Fluid Milk Quota and not all quota sold. The plaintiffs argued that the defendant breached the agreement by misleading and/or harassing the plaintiff. Dismissing the application, that the plaintiff was not in a conflict position. The issue was whether the agreement referred to a particular type of quota and therefore the defendant was obligated only to share proceeds of the sale from the sales of that quota and not only the sale. The dispute turned on whether the defendant had breached the terms of the previous quota. The only agreement that was clearly defined was that the reference to the Flud Milk Quotas and the Market Share Quota were interchangeable. The terms of this agreement were not binding on the plaintiff as they were both within the meaning of the terms provided by the agreement."
e_2005skqb263.txt,"Accused is charged with second degree murder in the death of his estranged wife. The Crown sought to admit into evidence a number of statements that were made by the deceased to several crown witnesses concerning two previous incidents she had with the accused in the weeks prior to her death. In the first incident, the accused is alleged to have choked the victim after he confronted her about where she had been. In the second incident the accused confronted the victim and beat and choked her and then sexually assaulted and threatened to kill her. The Crown seeks to admit this similar fact evidence and several hearsay statements to prove the issues of motive, intent and modus operandi. HELD: The statements by the deceased are not admissible. The prejudicial nature of the similar fact evidence has not been overcome by its probative value. It is well established law that similar acts and other discreditable conduct evidence is presumptively inadmissible and that similar fact evidence is the exception to this. To determine its admissibility, three things need examination, 1) the probative weight of the evidence, 2) the assessment of the prejudice and 3) the weighing of the probative value versus prejudicial value. In examining the probative weight of the evidence, factors to be considered include the issues in question, the presence or absence of collusion, similarities and dissimilarities between the facts charged and the similar fact evidence and the strength of the evidence that the events occurred. The two previous incidents are extremely prejudicial in nature leading to potential moral prejudice. That is, reprehensible nature of the assaults could lead the jury to rely on the prohibited inference that the accused is the type of person who could have committed the crime. There is also a great risk of reasoning prejudice. That is, admitting the similar fact evidence may distract the jury from their proper focus which is the second degree murder charge. There is a possibility that the jury will equate the intention to harm with the mens rea required for a murder conviction. With respect to the hearsay evidence, the Court held that statements made by the deceased to her friends, family and colleagues concerning the threats and assaults will not be admitted. The test of necessity is clearly met by the fact that the person making the statements in now deceased and not able to testify. However, the Court was concerned about the reliability of the statements since there is nothing that would serve as convincing indicia of reliability adequate to offset the absence of an oath.","The Crown sought to admit the two previous incidents of choking as similar fact evidence to prove issues of motive, intent and modus operandi. The accused was charged with assault causing bodily harm and sexual assault. She had been previously confronted by the husband who had assaulted her and had threatened to kill her if she did not drop the assault and sexual assaults charges. The Crown sought several hearsay statements made by the accused concerning the incidents. The defence argued that the Crown had not established a sufficient probative value to exclude the statements made to her friends, family and co-workers as admissible. HELD: The evidence was admitted as admissible. It was not debatable that the statements were made in good faith and supported the admissibility of the evidence. 1)It was clear that the two previously incidents of choked were extremely prejudicial in nature and there was a serious potential for moral prejudice. The evidence could be used to show hostile behaviour by the defendant who would lead to a motive to kill or to establish that the evidence of similar facts is not tainted with collusion. The prejudicial nature of the similar fact information had not been overcome by its probative Value and it should not be admitted in order to ensure the possibility of a fair trial.  2)The trial judge must not invade the province of a trier of fact and condition admissiblilty of hearsay on whether the evidence is ultimately reliable. However, it will need to examine whether the circumstances in which the statement was made lend sufficient credibility to allow a finding of threshold reliability."

Application dismissed; a judge of the Court of Appeal in Chambers does not have the authority to make the order requested; in any event, an application in the Family Division for leave to terminate the permanent care order would be a more appropriate way for the applicant to proceed.","The paternal grandmother applied in Chambers for an order that she be added as a party so that she can appeal a permanent care order respecting her granddaughter. The child was the subject of protection proceedings brought by the Children's Aid Society in the Family Division. The paternal grandmother did not participate in those proceedings. She now argued that a judge in Chambers does not have the authority to make the order sought. Application dismissed; the Family Court has jurisdiction to deal with the application and the matter is decided by a Chambers judge. The Chambers judge will only have jurisdiction to make an order if it is the right judge. In the circumstances, that judge would not make the ordered as, in the opinion, an application to the Family division for leave to terminate the permanent care orders appears likely to be a more appropriate initial way for the applicant to proceed."

HELD: Appeal dismissed. 1)It is an established principle that an appeal court should not interfere with the findings of fact by a trial judge unless the findings are not supported by the evidence or the conclusions reached by the trial judge are clearly wrong so as to make the decision unreasonable. 2)The trial judge did not misdirect himself on the law or the evidence with respect to the governing principles applicable to applications of this kind.,"The appellant appealed the order of Diehl, P.C.J. permanently committing his three children to the care of the Minister responsible for the Child and Family Services Act.

The trial judge provided written reasons wherein he carefully reviewed the applicable principles of law and applied them to the evidence. HELD: The appeal was dismissed with costs. It was an established fact that an appeal court should not interfere with the findings of fact by a trial judge unless the findings are not supported by the evidence or the conclusions reached by the trial judge are clearly wrong so as to make the decision unreasonable.

HELD: Application allowed. 1)The court has an inherent power to control its own process in garnishment proceedings. 2)The court also has the discretion to order the payment of the money to the plaintiff as a judgment creditor. 3)The chambers judge ordered that the monies held in court to the credit of this cause be paid to the plaintiff, but made no order as to costs.","The applicant applied for an order pursuant to s14 of the Attachment of Debts Act paying out to her certain monies paid into court by the Royal Bank of Canada and by Martindale Holdings Ltd. plus the interest thereon. The respondent was personally served with a garnishee summons but did not appear. HELD: The appeal was dismissed and the judgment amount paid out to the applicant was set aside. 1)The chambers judge erred by 'freezing' the money already paid into Court under the invalid garnishe summons pending resolution of the trial. There was no good case for the funds to be paid back to the defendants. 2)The judgment debtor appears only to have been served with the garnishoe summons once. There has been no application by the judgment debtor to set aside either garnislee summons garnises, nor did he appear to speak to the application for payment out. 3)The court exercised its discretion to allow the money to bepaid out, given the passage of time, even with all of the deficiencies. 4)The Chambers judge exercised his discretion in making the payment available to the plaintiff.

The court awarded costs to the plaintiff fixed at the amount involved - the quantum of general damages. The parties were unable to reach an amount of settlement. In this matter, the defendant argued that the costs should be fixed at the amount actually recovered by the plaintiff. Awarding the plaintiff one-third of her taxed costs, that to reduce costs by the percentage of fault of the plaintiff and to reduce the amount involved would be a double reduction.","The plaintiff was found two-thirds responsible for the injuries suffered in a 1987 motor vehicle accident. The defendant was found one-third responsible. The plaintiff claimed negligence by bringing an action against the defendant and claimed damages of $50,000.00. The defendants apportioned costs in the same percentage as the findings of fault. Civil Procedure Rule 41A.09 is applicable and the plaintiff is entitled to double her costs. However, in the circumstances, the Court exercised its discretion and declined to award costs on the counterclaim. The Court found that the defendants' offer to settle the matter was not realistic as it did not approximate the eventual recovery by the plaintiff. The plaintiffs' claim for loss of future income was also not supported by the evidence."

After completing the work, it commenced a claim for the additional work which had to be performed due to the undisclosed site conditions. The defendants were joined by the City as a third party to that action. The plaintiff was successful at trial, but the decision was overturned on appeal. The plaintiff then commenced the present action directly against the defendant, alleging negligent misrepresentation. The defendant applied to strike the action on the basis of res judicata and abuse of process. Granting the application, that the present cause of action is the same one litigated in the first action, simply under a different legal concept. To allow the plaintiff to relitigate the same action on the same factual basis would be an abuse of process.","The plaintiff was the successor corporate entity of Turf Masters Landscaping Limited by virtue of an amalgamation of the two companies. Turf masters had obtained a subcontract to perform most of the work on a recreational park and sports field for the City of Dartmouth. The consultants for the city had been aware of the material non-disclosure reports made by the city and the private equity firm that it retained to advise the city on the site problems. After obtaining a judgment against the city, Turfmasters commenced an action against the City and the Private Equity firm, Turfin Masters, alleging negligent misrepresentation and breach of standard of care, and claiming indemnity and breach against the second defendant, Bank of Montreal Trust Company. Turfin masters commenced an Action in Quantum Meruit against the County Court and the same defendant, the same defendants, Bank &Master, seeking to strike out the statement of claim and dismiss the action. The second defendant commenced an application in the same fashion as the first action and alleged negligent misrepresentations and breach and negligent misrepresentATION against the same plaintiff. The defendant brought a separate action against both Turf Master and Bank & Master, seeking a declaration that the City had paid the plaintiff's legal fees for the land and that the plaintiff had not disclosed the material information contained in the reports. The plaintiff brought a claim for breach of contract and breach in tort against the third defendant, also known as Bank &master. The defendants brought a second action under the Mechanics' Lien Act against the county court and Bank&Master seeking to have certain paragraphs of their defence struck out pursuant to Civil Procedure Rule 14.25 on the basis of res judicata and abuse of process. The Court dismissed the second application.

The Court found enough evidence to conclude that the central purpose of the contract for installation was not achieved and that there was a breach of the implied condition that it would be performed in a workmanlike standard. As the plaintiff's workmanship constitutes a breach of contract, the defendant's damages are set off against the claim.","The plaintiff obtained a lien under the Builders' Lien Act for the services of the defendant. The plaintiff also brought a claim for an order of protection against the defendant for $2,800.

The court found that the defendant had not met the implied condition of the contract that it would be performed in a workmanlike manner and that the plaintiffs were entitled to maintain their lien. The fact that the contract was not signed by the plaintiff but by the defendant was an indication that the work was not being performed in good and workmanly manner was grounds for a breach of the plaintiff's lien as the construction standard was not met.

The appellant sought to recover its losses from the respondent and relied on an exclusionary clause. Allowing the appeal in part, that (1) the agreement was unconscionable, having regard to the unequal bargaining power of the parties, the fact that the agreement was prepared by the appellant, and the fact that the appellant induced the respondent with its promotional brochure and its verbal representations as to the venture's viability to enter the franchise agreement; (2) the appellant cannot rely on an exclusionary clause given its unconscionable conduct; and (3) the appellant's claim for the value of the inventory together with pre-judgment interest was payable by the respondent. In a dissenting opinion, it was held that neither the appellant's conduct nor the franchise agreement was unconscionable; rather the respondent was an experienced businessman and the representations as to the venture's viability were mere projections, which he should have realized were unreliable.","The appellant was a wholly owned subsidiary of Imperial Oil involved in the distribution and sale of automotive parts and related products. Prior to 1985 that activity, exclusively wholesale, was achieved through a nation wide network of outlets leased from the appellant and operated by agents on a commission basis. Those agents were not required to make personal investment in the franchise, provide staff of two, rather than three, and were financially responsible for the inventory. The appellant knew from the outset that Murphy was not spending full time with the franchise. It knew from its inception that he was engaged in other businesses and could not spend full time there. It was important to maintain the balance of profits and to provide a viable case for the franchisee. The trial judge found that the appellant had not made any errors in this regard. The fact that the respondent had not conducted any such independent investigation was sufficient to affect the appellant's assessment of the facts."

Yellow Quill First Nation applied for intervenor status. The trial judge found, without giving reasons, that the project was a development as defined in the Environmental Assessment Act and the application for mandamus was adjourned sine die. HELD: The appeal was granted and the order set aside without costs. 1)The proposal was not a development as defined in s 2(d) of the EAA. The Department of Agriculture, the Department of the Environment and Resource Management were of the opinion that the KSS project was not a development as defined in the Act as it did not come within any of the criteria listed in s2(d). 2)The Environmental Assessment Branch was of the opinion that no significant impacts on the environment would occur or if they do, mitigation measures would be implemented to reduce or eliminate the potential for significant environmental impact.  3)It was not necessary to decide whether Yellow Quill or the respondents had standing to privately enforce a public right. 4)In light of the decision the following were not in issue: whether the respondent should have applied by way of judicial review in the nature of certiorari; the relationship between the Environmental Assessment and Agricultural Operations Act; and whether a proponent of an intensive livestock operation can be required to make an application under the Agricultural Operations Act and to carry out an environmental impact assessment under s9 of the EAA.",The respondents applied to the Court of Queen's Bench for an order compelling the applicant Department of Agriculture to conduct an environmental assessment pursuant to s. 9 of The Environmental Assessment Act. The second issue on the appeal was whether the project was a development as defined by s. 2(d) of the Act. HELD: The application was granted. The order of the Court was set aside without costs. 1) The chambers judge erred in law in granting the appellant standing for the private enforcement of a public right and in finding the project is a development under s.2(d). 2) The evidence filed by the respondents and the applicant clearly concerned more with the approval procedure required under the Agricultural Operations Act rather than whether the proposal was development under the Environmental Assessment act. The Environmental assessment Branch was not necessary to make any finding in connection with those matters. 3) The decision of the court was not required to consider the application of HL Pork Producers Ltd. requesting intervenor status. 4) The Court found the proposal to be a development was not a development by any stretch of the imagination. 5) The affidavit evidence filed on behalf of the appellant and the respondents was in breach of Rule 319.

He was seeking damages against the federal government for alleged abuses suffered while attending an Indian Residential School. The mother sought to attach the possible damage award for child support. HELD: The first $50,000 of any settlement proceeds, after payment of reasonable solicitor fees and disbursements, shall be paid into Court by his counsel. The Court agreed with the conclusion in Anderson that an order can be made with respect to damage awards even though, at the moment of the order, there is only a cause of action in existence and no precise amount of damages are known. There was no question that a cause of action or chose in action is property and thus the subject of an order under the Family Maintenance Act s.8. It is of no consequence that the order may be in another form such as money. To adopt any different analysis would be to unnecessarily limit the remedial application of s.8. Given the overarching purpose to ensure property is not wasted, thus impairing or defeating a claim under the FMA, it was logical orders can be made by the Court that are ancillary or a natural incident of the primary order preserving the property.

The mother argued that the records sought were irrelevant and that if there was any relevance, they were privileged, were unnecessary to the fair disposition of the proceeding, and their production would not save costs and would be injurious to the public interest. The addiction prevention and treatment service, Nova Scotia Hospital and mental health clinic records and files are ordered to be produced; the medical records of the family physician, the hospital and the woman's shelter are not ordered to be produced as these files would contain some irrelevant information and the relevant information could be obtained by other means. In a child protection proceeding, documents may be relevant to prove a protection finding, to monitor compliance with existing orders, or to develop and evaluate a plan of care. Records held by individuals or organizations to whom an individual has been referred as a result of a child protection proceeding are not privileged as no confidentiality could be expected in those circumstances. Records held by individuals or organizations whose services were accessed independent of a court order or the Minister's involvement that would ordinarily attract privilege may be ordered to be produced in child protection proceedings. However, if the information contained in the records can be obtained by a means targeted specifically to produce the relevant information, then orders for production for all of the records will not be necessary to the fair disposition of the proceeding. Also, since such records contain irrelevant, as well as relevant material, such an order would violate the privacy protections found in the Charter and be injurious to the public interest.","The applicant sought 13 Orders of Production for documents prepared by and in the possession of persons and organizations who had provided services to the applicant. The applicant argued that this was an application that was made under the protection order of the Minister. The Minister had requested the records because they were confidential. Application allowed; the documents excluded. The court found that the applicant had no interest in maintaining the confidentiality of the information requested and that the requests for production were not necessary for a fair disposition of the proceeding. The fact that the documents were created as result of the applicant's involvement in a previous child protection proceeding did not disqualify her from seeking the records. The only requirement is that the records be of sufficient interest to the Minister to maintain the confidentiality. The documents will not be able to be produced for the purpose of monitoring compliance with the orders made. The application for the production of the records was dismissed. The higher standard used in criminal proceedings to determine relevancy should apply to child protection proceedings. The nature of these proceedings have very serious consequences for parents and for the court that demand a heightened concern for accuracy in fact finding. The purpose of our Civil Procedure Rules is to secure the just, speedy and inexpensive determination of every proceeding. This is a higher standard than that imposed in R. v. O'Connor (1995), 138 N.S.R. (2d) 225 (SCC), and the Supreme Court confirmed that there are three purposes for which an agency may seek records: 1) to obtain information; 2) to prepare reports or to answer interrogatories; 3) to review all of the material; and 4) to ensure that records of interest are properly disclosed. The Court found that requiring the applicant to provide documents to determine whether there are other circumstances in the applicant’s life that would place her at risk of exposure to addictions and mental illness; 5) to protect the privacy of witnesses; 6) to provide evidence of the quality of the medical records requested, including medical reports specific to the identified concerns; 7) to establish whether the applicant was currently receiving services. The information may be of interest to her family physician, her family doctor, her former counsellor with Capital Health Addiction Prevention and Treatment Services and 9) to the assessor. The assessors will have access to historic and current files detailing every contact made by the applicant with her family physicians and other service providers.

2_2000skqb53.txt,"An appeal from Provincial Court on a Small Claim. The Jabours, the third parties who acquired title to the house, firmly bolted a wheelchair lift loaned to them by the Abilities Council by anchor bolts in a concrete slab. The Jabours sold to the Kapronczais who in turn sold the property 2 years later to the respondent, San Diego, but made no mention about ownership of the wheelchair lift. The lift ceased to operate and San Diego contacted the Abilities Council which claimed ownership to the lift. San Diego was awarded judgment for the depreciated value against Kapronczai who joined the Jabours as third parties claiming over against them for the San Diego claim. HELD: The appeal was dismissed against the plaintiff and the third party. 1)The wheelchair lift never became part of the realty notwithstanding how it was affixed. It was not the intention of either party that it become part of the realty. The intention of the parties is a prime factor in determining whether something is affixed to and becomes part of the realty. 2)The manner of attaching the lift only to the concrete slab arguably showed an intention that it not be permanent and part of the property.  3)Section 237(2) of the Land Titles Act protects a purchaser of realty against an unregistered interest in that realty. Interest is defined in s.237(1)(a)as any estate or interest in land. It is not intended to protect the purchaser of realty to which something is affixed that is not intended to the knowledge of the purchaser to be part of the realty. The defendants purported to sell that which was not theirs giving a claim for damages.

The Jabours appealed the Provincial Court decision dismissing the claim. HELD: Appeal dismissed. In the circumstances, the appeal was dismissed both as it affects the plaintiff and the third party. The wheelchair lift never became part of the real estate and the intention of the parties is a prime factor in determining whether something affixed thereto becomes a part of a realty."
2_2000skqb301.txt,"Plaintiff, as litigation guardian for his four daughters, alleged that the defendant, in breach of a trust, wrongfully retained $20,000 to which his daughters are entitled. Mabel, mother of the plaintiff and the defendant, set aside $20,000 in a bank account. Prior to her death, Mabel gave written instructions to the defendant to give $5,000 to each granddaughter. The defendant claimed that the money was to be held to pay the estate's expenses and then be divided among Mabel's children. The money was never issued to the granddaughters. The plaintiff claims that the written instructions to the defendant constituted the establishment of a trust and that the defendant is the trustee of the money for the benefit of the granddaughters. HELD: Plaintiff's claim dismissed with costs to the defendant to be taxed at double column 2. An incomplete voluntary transfer will not be construed as a declaration of trust unless it appears that there is an intention to declare a trust, and not merely make a transfer. Mabel's written instructions do not contain any words that could possibly be construed as a declaration of trust. She intended to make monetary gifts. The fact that the defendant did not take the necessary steps to complete the intended gifts during Mabel's lifetime does not result in that intention being converted into a declaration of trust. As to costs, the plaintiff alleged that the defendant committed fraud and this was never withdrawn nor proven. Asserting an unfounded allegation of fraud justifies a special order as to costs.","The plaintiff alleged that the defendant had wrongfully, in breach of a trust, retained the sum of $20,000 to which his four daughters were entitled. The plaintiff had four children: Bruce, Wanda, Jonathon and Jonathon. HELD: The claim was dismissed. The evidence showed that the written instructions given to the defendant were to be the establishment of a trusting for the four granddaughters. The instructions were given to Brenda, who had been hospitalized and then died in March 1998 at which time the money in the bank account was to be divided between the plaintiff's four children. The trust was not formed to make a gift, but to be converted into an equity in the favour of the plaintiff. The purpose of the instructions was to divide the interest earned on the bank accounts into four equal amounts, with the balance to be split between the four grandchildren. An incomplete voluntary transfer will not be construed as a declaration of trust unless it appears that there is an intention to declare a trust and not merely to make one transfer. The defendant was found to have divided the money equally."

HELD: The appeal was dismissed. The tenant was not denied natural justice or due process. While the description of cleaning did not specifically state the number of hours or hourly rate, it was sufficient to alert the tenant that it was for hours of work as well as for painting.

c_2009skqb514.txt,"FIAT: The respondent mother filed a motion asking for an order quantifying child support arrears which she claims are due and owing pursuant to the order of Gunn, J. in September, 2008. She also asks that the Court determine the ongoing child support amount to be paid by the petitioner father. The Court questioned whether this application was more in the nature of a variation of the Gunn, J. order. It is clear that there has been a change since September 2008 with respect to the residency of one of the children.HELD: 1) The father's unusual 2008 taxation year has led to the parties taking very different positions as to how the father's income should be calculated. The father argues that it would be appropriate to average the father's income for 2006 to 2008. The mother argues that his income is the sum set out on line 150 of his tax return. She argues that his total income is the sum of $302,196 for the 2008 year. The father's argument is that the severance he received in 2008 should not be included in his income. It is well established that severance pay represents an acceleration of income that would have been paid over a period of months. It is also well established that income for the basis of calculating child support should be determined on the basis of severance pay plus whatever other earnings the payor may have. The severance is included as part of the father's income. 2) The capital gain which shows on the father's 2008 income tax return shall not be included in his 2008 income. The father agreed as part of the distribution of family income to assume responsibility for the capital gain on the real estate he was receiving as part of the family property division. The gain does not reflect income actually received by the father and there will be no 'year to year' capital gains. See Andersen v. Andersen (1997), 32 R.F.L. (4th) 177. 3) The father's income for 2008 is $270,300.  4) If the parties were to proceed in accordance with their own agreement and consent order, the father would be forced to pay on his inflated 2008 income. However, the mother would then be forced to pay back to the father the overpayment. As of May 2009 the father's income is the sum of $160,000. 5) The mother shall have her costs of $600.","The mother has filed a motion requesting an order quantifying child support arrears which she says are due and owing pursuant to the 2008 order. In addition, she requests that the court determine the ongoing child support amount to be paid by the petitioner father. HELD: 1) The father's income is $160,000. With respect to the capital gain shown on the father's 2008 income tax return, the Court has determined that the capital gains are a non-reoccurring amount which should not be included in the determination of the father’s 2008 income. It is well established that income for the basis of calculating child support should be determined on the basis OF severance pay plus whatever other earnings the payor may have. 2) The fact that the father spent his severance funds on legal fees and to set up his new home in Alberta is irrelevant. The mother would then be forced to remit back to the father the overpayment. 3) With respect only to the issue of s. expenses, the court determined that $25,000 is a non recurring amount which could be adjusted in accordance with the order. The father was also responsible for some arrear payments. 4) The Court reviewed the decision of Andersen v. Andersen and determined that his income is the sum of $160k. The fact the father used his severances funds on the legal fees was irrelevant. If the parties proceeded in accordance under their own agreement and consent order, the father would be forced by default to pay on his inflated 2008 income but the mother would be able to remitt back to him the overpayments. 5) The amount of arrearing payable for 2008 is $278,000 which should be set aside for future payments. The Court found that income from the basis for calculating child care support should also be determined based on the same set of guidelines."
3_1999canlii12258.txt,An appeal from an order varying a child maintenance order which had been based on a written agreement between the parties entered into a week before the Federal Child Support Guidelines came into effect. The application to vary made about a year later was based mainly on the coming into effect of the guidelines. The decision to not to allow evidence on all issues because of conflicting affidavits gave rise to the first ground of appeal. The appellant also argued that the judge erred in finding that an order to vary would not be inequitable within the meaning of s.17(6.2) by reason of the terms of the written agreement and resulting order which contained special provisions to benefit the children. He also objected to the s.7(1)(f) order for $230 per month for extraordinary extracurricular expenses. HELD: The appeal was dismissed with the exception of the payments under s.7(1)(f) which were set aside. 1)The applicant was not denied the right to lead evidence on any relevant issue. Although the judge made no reversible error the procedure followed was not approved of. The principles stated in Zaba v. Bradley were reaffirmed. 2)No reversible error was found in the finding the appellant did not have custody of or access to the children for enough time to bring him within s.9; that the appellant's income for purposes of the Guidelines should include the bonuses received from his employer; and that he did not have a business based in his home. 3)The judge erred in not addressing the question as to whether the expenses were extraordinary within the meaning of s.7(1)(f). The activities were ordinary given the income of the parents and fell within the table amount fixed under s.3(1)(a).  4)Each party was to bear his/her own costs.,"The appellant was granted the right to lead evidence concerning matters concerning the children under the Federal Child Support Guidelines. The issue on appeal was whether the appellant's expenses fell within the standard of living within the meaning of s. 7(1)(f) of the Guidelines. HELD: The appeal was dismissed. The portion of the judgment relating to payments under s.7(1(f) was set aside. There was no reversible error in the judge's decision, explained in the reasons for judgment, to reject the appellant’s arguments respecting that issue. There were no errors in the court’S decisions supported by written reasons, that the appellant did not have custody of or access to the children for enough time to bring him within s.9 of the guidelines; the appellant was not entitled to include bonuses he received from his employer in 1996 and 1997 and (c) Mr. Elliott did not own a business based in the home."
5_2008nssc77.txt,"The claimant brought an action in the Small Claims Court to enforce a default judgment it had been granted against the defendant in Alberta for breach of contract. The claimant attempted to proceed in Nova Scotia on the basis of reciprocal enforcement under the common law or enforcement of the debt as a contract. The adjudicator dismissed the action, finding that the Small Claims Court did not have the authority to enforce an order arising from a foreign jurisdiction and that it could not proceed with the claim for breach of the agreement under the contract as there was no evidence that the Alberta action had been withdrawn, struck or transferred out. The adjudicator also found that the defendant had not attorned to the jurisdiction of the Alberta court. The claimant appealed. Appeal dismissed; although the adjudicator's interpretation of sec. 15 of the Act and his finding that the defendant had not attorned to the jurisdiction of the Alberta court when there was no evidence before him on that issue constituted errors in law, the present claim was beyond the scope of the Small Claims Court Act, given that the adjudicator would first be called upon to settle a dispute regarding the original court's jurisdiction, the locus of the original contract and a factual dispute concerning attornment.","The claimants commenced an action for breach of contract against the respondent in Alberta Court of Queen's Bench. The respondent did not file a defence and the plaintiff obtained default judgment for an amount not cited. The claim was reduced from the amount of its judgment to fall within the monetary limits established by the Small Claims Court Act and in the alternative, enforcement of the debt as contract. The defendant claimed the Alberta Court did not have jurisdiction. The parties appeared before the trial judge for hearing on the issue of whether the Small claims Court had jurisdiction to hear the claim filed by the claimants. The trial judge found that s. 9 of the Act did not provide the Court with authority to enforce an Order arising from foreign jurisdiction. He further determined that, although the Court had the jurisdiction to proceed with the claim for breach under the Alberta judgment under the common law, it was prohibited as there was no evidence 'that the Alberta action was withdrawn, abandoned, struck out or transferred' pursuant to s. 15 of the act. Rather than determine a claim based on a fixed amount, it is apparent an Adjudicator, in a case of this nature, would be called upon first to settle a dispute regarding the original Court's jurisdiction, the locus of the original contract, and a factual dispute concerning attornment. The present claim extends beyond the authority of the Small Claim Court Act. The applicant has the option of proceeding to enforce the Alberta judgement under the Reciprocal Enforcement of Judgments Act, or to proceed under its common law remedy under contract. Both options are open to the applicant. The Adjudicators interpretation of s.15 represents an error in law. Clearly the purpose of the legislation, the remedial goals, the underlying values of efficiency and access to justice, and the potential for a complex and lengthy fact finding process extend beyond the claim beyond the jurisdiction of the small claims court."

Rejecting the applications, that a Court of Appeal judge sitting in chambers does not have the jurisdiction to grant intervener status or to join a person as a party to a proceeding. Furthermore, as the union was not a party to the original proceeding, and was not joined as an intervener, or as a party defendant, by order of a Supreme Court judge, it does not have standing to file an appeal.","The union applied for leave to obtain intervener status as a party or as an intervener in a civil procedure matter and to bring an appeal from orders made in 1999 and 1999 regarding the settlement of a labour dispute between the defendant and the plaintiff. The Union argued that the trial judge erred in law in permitting the sole defendant(s) to stand as the sole defendants in the proceeding, and in denying status to the union. The plaintiff brought an application to have the trial Judge find that the defendant had exceeded his jurisdiction as an individual and had not provided proper notice to the plaintiff and in failing to provide proper notice, the judge denied the application. The union sought to be joined as an amicus curiae or intervener by order of the Supreme Court and an added intervener under Rule 62.35. The order of October 1st simply continued the interim injunction until further court order. The application to be added as an interlocutory intervener was dismissed. The court found that the Union had not shown it could rely upon Rule 5.04 as an option and dismissed the application as not being joined as a partner or as intervener pursuant to Rule 5.(e) and Rule 8. The Court found that it had jurisdiction to grant intervener Status as a result of the decisions made in the previous cases. In this case, the Union did not have the status to file an appeal."

With respect to EK the Department seeks an order placing him with the Minister until his 16th birthday. This order was granted at trial. The parents do not oppose the applications with respect to JS and EK but the mother seeks the return of CS to her care. HELD: JS is in need of protection and he shall be placed with SK for an indefinite period. JS shall not be returned to live with his parents without a further order of this Court. This does not prevent JS from spending unsupervised time with his parents including overnight visits. CS is in need of protection and she shall remain in the custody of the Minister for a period of 3 months. During that time, the parents shall work with DCR to develop a case plan for CS's return. TK will have a mental health assessment as arranged for by DCR and will follow any recommendations of the mental health professional and participate in the Victim Intervention Program. KS will attend any session at Alternatives to Violence arranged for by DCR. 1) The Court was satisfied that the children were exposed to domestic violence or severe domestic disharmony. 2) Matters did not move quickly once the children were placed in the care of DCR. Instead of working with DCR to ensure a smooth reintegration of the children into their home, the parents vacated their apartment, moved to Alberta for a while, lived in a series of motels, camped at SK's apartment building and even lived in a tent. During that period of time, some of which encompassed the trial, the Court was not satisfied that there was an adult person who was willing and able to provide for the children's needs. The children are in need of protection within the meaning of s. 11 of the Act. 3) There is a reasonable prospect of change within a reasonable period of time. KS has quit drinking. TK is now employed. KS has attended some anger management programming flowing from his criminal conviction. The parents have a residence. TK is taking medication which promotes the continuation of her mental health. DCR acknowledged that there are no current issues with TK's mental health and that have not been for some time. TK says she is prepared to work with DCR to ensure the return of her children. The Court accepts TK's disinclination to work with Ms. Fraser. The success of the involvement of DCR in the life of this family would be enhanced with the assignment of another worker.","The Department of Community Resources seeks orders pursuant to The Child and Family Services Act placing the respondent with the Department until age 18, and placing the child with his grandmother as a Person of Sufficient Interest pursuant to s. 37(1)(b). The children have the same biological parents. The respondent does not oppose the applications in respect of the respondent and [E.K.] but seeks the return of the child to her care. HELD: The children are in the care of the Department of community resources. The Department of Child andFamily Services seeks orders under The Child & Family Services act placing the appellant with the Minister until age 16, but in view of the appellant's stated intention to return to his parents' home on his 16th birthday, which was granted at trial. The children who are the same age as the respondent are cohabitating. The appellant does not represent herself. She took steps to obtain counsel. She ultimately decided to continue representing herself. The trial commenced June 26, 2006 and concluded September 29, 2006. The issues are: 1) whether the children are properly placed in the custody of the Minister; 2) whether there is a reasonable risk of physical harm to the appellant if the administration of justice determines that the appellant is in need of protection; 3) whether an order for custody of these children should be made in light of the evidence before the Court in respect to the Apprehension hearing. The child who is the respondent in this case is 11 years old and in Grade 8. The Court found that the child who was the respondent to the apprehension hearing was 12 years old or more. The parties agreed that the Court would consider the best interests of the children if they were placed in their care, and that the administration would consider information as to the respondent's treatment compliance from her mental health professionals and mental health facilities. The court found that 11 years of age and the respondent was 11 years, if the Court had a reasonable doubt as to whether the appellant had a psychiatric illness, that the respondent would be more than willing to assist the child in his recovery. The administration of the Children and Family services is to provide, wherever appropriate, services that are designed to maintain, support and preserve the family in the least disruptive manner. The Apprehensions hearing was adjourned sine die. The matter was directed to September 13, 2005. The order to return the children to the custody hearing was dismissed.

HELD: The application lacked compelling reasons to keep the young person in custody.  1) This was the first experience with an application of this nature in Saskatoon and the Court provided a detailed discussion of the procedure for the benefit of future applications. 2) The application was not brought in a reasonable time having regard to all of the circumstances.

The Young Person was 18 years old and was residing with his girlfriend when the application was made. The Provincial Director had yet to consider conditions of supervision in light of the latest decision to make for continuation. HELD: The application was granted. The young person was ordered released pending a full hearing. The court found that the criteria for continuation was really limiting. There was insufficient detail on the factors listed in s.98(3)(b). There was no evidence of pattern of persistent violent behaviour and the young person had only 90 days remaining for the community supervision portion of his sentence. There were no new offences committed. The issue was whether the young Person was likely to re-offend. The Court found that this likely event. The test for continuation had not appeared too stringent as the court need only be satisfied on reasonable grounds of the governing criteria for continued custody. There had been a substantial defect that was not fatal to the decision regard remand or release pending the hearing.
8_1997canlii9861.txt,"This was an appeal from a Supreme Court decision dismissing certiorari applications to quash three orders of the Labour Relations Board ordering the appellant to reinstate the respondents and pay them compensation for dismissing them due to their support of a union. The appellant alleged that the Board's order should be quashed because it failed to give reasons for its decision. Allowing the appeal and remitting the matter for rehearing, that there is an implied duty on a tribunal to provide written reasons whenever substantial issues are involved and the reasons for the tribunal's decision are not obvious from a review of the issues and the record. In this case, the order of the Board imposed significant financial liability on the appellant, and the issues were complex and the concerns of the parties were substantial. As a result, the Board acted in a patently unreasonable manner in giving its decision without providing reasons.","The respondent hotel manager appealed three orders of the Labour Relations Board (Nova Scotia) ordering her to reinstate the individual respondents, to pay them compensation and to reconsider the first two orders.

1990canlii2449.txt,"This was an appeal from a decision dismissing the appellant's application for an order in the nature of certiorari to quash the decision of the Social Assistance Appeal Board for the City of Halifax which affirmed the rejection of the appellant's application for municipal social assistance as an expectant mother. The appellant was a pregnant unmarried 16 year old living with her parents at the time of her application for social assistance. The trial judge concluded that under Municipal Assistance Policy 1.2.5 the applicant was not eligible since she was not a single head of a family maintaining a home for herself and her dependant child. Allowing the appeal, that s. 23(1) of the Social Assistance Act places a mandatory responsibility upon social service committees to provide assistance for all persons in need as defined in s. 19(e) of the Act. Pursuant to this statute, the City of Halifax has approved municipal assistance policies and Policy 1.2.5 relating to an 'Unmarried Mother - Pending Birth' was intended to set out the circumstances under which an unmarried mother was to be eligible. It was not intended that the appellant have to be already maintaining a home for herself and one or more dependant children. In a dissenting opinion, Chipman, J.A. concluded that as the provision with respect to an 'Unmarried Mother - Pending Birth' came under the heading 'Single Head of Family', the provision is merely an extension to include within the definition of a single head of a family an unwed mother whose child is not yet born. The requirement that she be a single head of a family maintaining a home still stands.","This was an appeal from the decision of the Social Assistance Appeal Board quashing the decision to deny the appellant's application for social assistance as an expectant mother. Dismissing the application, that the Social Services Board had correctly interpreted the Halifax Social Assistance Policy as meaning that an unmarried mother pending the birth of her first child was not eligible for assistance. The appellant was, however, supported by her parents and was receiving social assistance. She was not dependent upon her stepfather, who was the head of family and maintaining the household in which she lived, nor was she a'reasonable person in need' under the policy. Allowing the appeal and remitting the matter to the Social Security Board for a review, that although the provision allowing the municipality to consider support for an unmarried mom pending birth was discretionary, the Appeal Board erred in treating the provision in question as creating a discretionary right to assistance."

b_2000skqb572.txt,"The accused was charged with sexual assault under s.271 of the Criminal Code. Although the DNA evidence established he had sexual intercourse with the complainant, neither had any memory of it due to their self-induced states of intoxication. Defences raised were consent, an honest but mistaken belief that she gave her consent, and extreme drunkenness such that he was so intoxicated that he was not in a conscious state and was incapable of forming any intent to have sexual intercourse without consent. HELD: The accused was found guilty.  1)Although the defence of 'extreme intoxication' is successful in the rarest of cases, the accused established the Daviault 'extreme intoxication' on a balance of probabilities. He would have been acquitted had it not been for s.33.1 which does away with this defence in sexual assault cases.  2)The court was satisfied on a balance of probabilities that his extreme level of self-induced intoxication rendered him incapable of making a conscious decision to have sexual intercourse with the complainant with or without her consent. The court was satisfied that the complainant had not done anything to suggest that she would consent. The accused was incapable of considering the issue of consent and accordingly did not have a mistaken belief or reasonable grounds for such a belief. It was clear from the testimony of an 11 year old that the intercourse took place long after the complainant passed out. She was incapable of giving consent after that time. Her assertion of lack of consent was inherently unreliable due to her lack of any memory of events that occurred before, during and after the alleged assault and would have been more in the nature of an assumption than a fact, but was found to be consistent with all the other evidence. It was not relevant that she may have withdrawn consent. 3)There was no evidence to give his second defence (that he honestly believed he had her consent) an air of reality. His assertion that she must have consented or he would not have done it was speculative assumption, not evidence. 4)Section 33.1 provides that the act of becoming voluntarily intoxicated to the extent of being incapable of controlling one's behaviour constitutes criminal culpability sufficient to found criminal liability for offences committed against the bodily integrity of others. The public outcry and Parliamentary response to Daviault strongly indicate that s.33.1 is not only consistent with the objectives of the Charter but is justifiable and essential in a free and democratic society. Of four recent cases that held Criminal Code s.33.1 violates the Charter, two held it was saved by s.1 while two held it was not saved by s.1 of the Charter. 5)Section 33.1(1) provides the lack of general intent or voluntariness is not a defence to an assault charge described in ss.(3)if it resulted from self-induced intoxication or the accused departed markedly from the standard of reasonable care generally recognized in Canadian society. The three sub-conditions described in ss.(2) concerning marked departure constitute criminal culpability similar to recklessness. Criminal culpability is not dependent on wilful intention to cause harm but on the wilful intention to engage in conduct that incurs the risk of harm without caring whether or not harm ensues. 6)The strong dissent in Daviault indicated those who render themselves incapable of knowing what they are doing through voluntary consumption of alcohol or drugs possess a sufficiently blameworthy state of mind that their imprisonment does not offend the principle of fundamental justice which prohibits the imprisonment of the innocent. The court has broad discretion to differentiate in sentences imposed for offences that were deliberately committed and those that were committed involuntarily because of self-induced intoxication.","The accused was charged with sexual assault contrary to s. 271 of the Criminal Code. Although the DNA evidence established that the accused had sexual intercourse with the complainant, neither the accused nor the complainant had any memory of the sexual intercourse that took place between them. HELD: The accused was found guilty. 1) The Court had broad discretion to differentiate in sentences imposed for offences that were deliberately committed and those that were committed involuntarily because of self-induced intoxication. The Court reviewed the cases that dealt with the issue of the accused's belief in the truthfulness of consent and found that such a defence was not available in those circumstances. 2) The defence of 'extreme drunkenness' was successful in the rarest of cases. The accused testified that he was so intoxicated that he could not remember anything before the sexual assault took place and he never considered the issue if the complainant was incapable of consenting. The facts were very different from those in the case before and the Court was satisfied that the defence of such a behaviour was successful. 3) In sexual assault cases, the lack of general intent or voluntariness (which is usually an integral element of any criminal offence) is not defence to an assault type of charge. The defence is based on the principles of reasonable care generally recognized in Canadian society. The principles of'reasonable care' and 'consent' are not co-evolved by virtue of the fact that the individual who expressed such a lack of interest in consent is incapable of controlling it. 4) The accused's extreme intoxication did not preclude the defence on a balance of probabilities. The fact that he had been drinking and consumed significant amounts of alcohol and was in a state of intoxication did contribute to the difference in perception of what transpired. The evidence raised by the defence raised by this case was that the complainant's denial of consent was not evidence but merely speculative assumption. 5) The evidence of the 11-year old son who was in the house and was able to arouse the complainant varied from one case to another. The same conclusion was reached in R. v. Tom (1998), 129 C.C.C.(3d) 540 (B.C.) (Ont. C.A.). 6) The court was satisfied on a case by case basis that the evidence raised was inconsistent with the accused’s evidence as to the state of his intoxication. It was not necessary for the Crown to call DNA evidence to establish the evidence. The court reviewed the case law regarding the use of force when it comes to intervening in"

He was released from custody on his consent to a term that prohibited him from picketing or carrying placards pending his trial. He later applied for a review of the order and sought an amendment permitting him to picket lawfully. HELD: Application dismissed. Amendment refused. If the accused was permitted to picket there was a substantial likelihood that he would commit another offence while on bail pending his trial on the four existing charges. The justice granting the judicial interim release order was therefore correct to impose a complete prohibition on picketing.,"FIAT. The accused applied for a review of theterms of his judicial interim release. He and his counsel consented to a judicial interim released order containing certain terms. The picketing prohibition term of the release from custody was considered necessary by the justice who made the order to address the substantial likelihood that the accused would commit a criminal offence if he were not prohibited from picketing prior to his trial. HELD: The application was denied and the existing order stood.  1)The picketing was reasonably restrained as a condition of the released of the accused from custody and the release of the other accused was reasonably justified as acondition of the re-entry of the offender. 2)If the amendment was specifically requested, there still remained a substantial likelihood he would commit criminal offence or aninterference with the administration of justice. 3)The aggravating factors were the nature of the offences with which the accused was charged, the circumstances surrounding the alleged commission of the offence, the accused's stated intention to continue picketing and his stated intention only to continue it."

Hypothetical questions seeking his opinion consequent upon his professional experience could be asked where his and C&amp;L's conduct were in issue.

HELD: The plaintiff's motion was granted. The court ordered that the defendants answer all questions relating to the plaintiff's claim and that they should be prepared to answer them. 1)The plaintiff was not required to answer questions on discovery about his opinion of audit issues arising in the context of Saskatchewan Trust Company records or files. 2)The defendant was required to provide specific information about the files not previously disclosed. 3)The discovery of documents was to be of no importance to the trial judge as the undertowakings were being complied with. 4)The defendants were to provide the plaintiff with specific information as to the files which were not previously disclose. 5)The plaintiffs were to have their questions answered by the defendant's counsel in any event of the cause. 6)Costs were awarded to the defendant."

2008skpc160.txt,"The accused is charged with aggravated assault. A voir dire was held to determine whether the accused's s. 8, s. 9, s. 10(a) and s. 10(b) Charter rights were breached. HELD: There was no breach of the accused's Charter rights. 1) There is no evidence to establish that the accused did not speak to legal counsel. The agreed statement of facts establishes that the accused asked to speak with Ms. Bohachik, a lawyer with Legal Aid. The police officer put the accused in contact with legal aid duty counsel instead. When the officer told the accused that Ms. Bohachik worked with Legal Aid the accused said 'ok, Legal Aid is fine'. The accused was put in contact with Legal Aid duty counsel. There was no breach of the accused s. 10(b) rights.  2) Applying the common law definition of arrest to the present situation, it is apparent that telling a person that he is no longer under arrest, without releasing him from custody, does not terminate the arrest. It is only by ending the custody of the accused by releasing him that the arrest is ended and the accused is 'un-arrested'. It was agreed that the officer had sufficient grounds to arrest the accused. The arrest being legally made, it follows that the arrest continued until it was legally ended by his release. The arrest continued throughout the search and seizure at the police station. The Court finds that his continued detention after the purported 'un-arrest' constituted a de facto arrest. 3) There is no evidence that the accused misunderstood his actual status or that he was prejudiced by the 'un-arrest'. The accused has not established that he was the subject of 'unreasonable search or seizure' resulting in the violation of his rights under the Charter.","The accused was charged with aggravated assault. Prior to his trial, the accused gave notice that he would be making an application to the Court for a ruling that the accused's rights under s. 8, 9, and 10 (a) and (b) of the Charter had been infringed and sought a remedy. The accused was detained in a police station and then transported to the police station by police officer. The police officer who was in the police force arrived at the scene and arrested the accused. The defence requested that the voir dire be entered and the evidence of the police officer was excluded. The officer put the accused in contact with a lawyer working for Legal Aid. The argument that the defence had misrepresented the accused and his right to a fair trial ended in an 'un-arrest'. HELD: The voir net was entered and all of the evidence taken on the trial proper was applicable. 1)The initial arrest was lawful, was not terminated by the purported 'un arrest' of the accused, and continued throughout the search and seizure at the police police station. His continued detention after the purported “de facto” arrest constituted a de facto arrest as described in Latimer.  2)The accused's continued detention on his own initiative and upon his request to contact that lawyer would not have ended in a violation of his rights under the Charter. The Court held that the initial arrest by the police was lawful and was not ended by the alleged 'de facto' arrest. The continued detention of the officer after the alleged “un-arrrest” constituted ade facto arrest resulting in a breach of his right under the charter.  3)The Court was not satisfied that the first arrest was a 'de-jure' arrest, as it had not ended in the accused being arrested or being detained for any reason. The evidence of that lawyer was excluded throughout. The voiry net was not referred to at all in Latimore. The court was not encouraged by the evidence in the Saskatchewan case to this extent."

The original five year lease for use of the Jubilee Building as a bingo hall between Fundraising td. and REAL was assigned to GCB with REAL's written consent. GCB further sublet the building without REAL's consent or knowledge. Written notice of renewal was not sent to REAL. The basis of GCB's application was estoppel on the basis that REAL entered negotiations regarding a relocation of the bingo hall and then began to deal directly with CGB's sub-tenant after the renewal date had passed. HELD: The application was dismissed. Costs in the cause. 1)There was no evidence that Fundraisers, the original party to the lease, attempted to exercise the option to renew. 2)GCB did not have a strong prima facie case on the merits. It appeared that there were no negotiations between GCB and REAL. 3)There would not be irreparable harm. Under the current arrangements, the bingo would be operated by RCBA. If successful at trial the damages to GCB can be easily calculated based on the time it was unable to occupy the premises. 4)On balance GCB failed to satisfy the burden of proof that the inconvenience it will suffer by the refusal of the injunction will be greater than that suffered by REAL if granted.","The applicant sought an interlocutory injunction restraining the applicant from entering into any lease with the Regina Exhibition Association (REAL) and permitting the operation of a bingo hall by the applicant except as a tenant. The applicant had entered into written agreements with the applicant for the day to day operation of the bingo halls and entered into verbal agreements with its subordinate tenant to advise the tenant of its position on a date well after the renewal option deadline. REAL was not aware of the agreement and was not asked to provide its consent, as required by the lease and the first sub-lease. HELD: The application was dismissed. 1)There was no negotiations between REAL and the applicant. There was no promise on the part of REAL to follow up on these discussions, nor was there any discussion about exercising the option to renew either through the applicant or directly.  2)The applicant failed to satisfy the burden of proof that the applicant will suffer from the inconvenience it will suffer if the refusal of the injunction is granted. 3)The Applicant had entered negotiations with the respondent and then began to deal directly with the subtenant after the expiration of the lease. 4)The applicants had entered discussions about a possible future for the bing hall but there was no indication that the parties would agree to renew the lease or that the Applicant would advise the Tenant of its current position. 5)The application for an interlocal injunction was dismissed in the exercise of its discretion. Costs were to be awarded in the cause."
c_2006nsca45.txt,"The president of a company against whom the Securities Commission had ordered an investigation applied to the court for certiorari to quash the investigation. He alleged that the investigators had improperly obtained and used the contents of his email, some of which were subject to solicitor and client privilege. In the context of the certiorari application, the company president successfully argued that the Commission's return should contain the fruits of the investigation so far and that he should be entitled to examine one of the investigators for discovery. The Commission appealed, arguing that the underlying judicial review application was improper and premature and thus, the procedural orders should not have been made. Appeal allowed; the underlying judicial review application is stayed; the stay may be lifted by a judge of the Supreme Court on application with notice; the Order of the chambers judge on the procedural matters arising in that application is set aside. The underlying judicial review application was premature because the Commission should have had the opportunity to consider and address the company president's complaints. The decision as to whether or not to release the information sought required the balancing of competing interests in light of the overall statutory scheme and the specific circumstances of the case; the Commission was in the best position to conduct such an exercise.","The respondent received an investigation order for the investigation of the trading in the securities of Knowledge House Inc. (the company's president, CEO and Chair) which was quashed by the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia. Following an interlocutory application by the respondent to quash the investigation, the Commission applied to the Nova Scotia Supreme Court for certiorari to quashing the investigation and to order the return of all of the emails, including those obtained in the course of its investigation. The chambers judge ordered the Commission to file a return of the email records and upheld (with some variation) the notice of examination that the investigator had issued to the respondent. The Commission applied for leave to appeal. The application for a stay of the judicial review application was granted and the underlying judicial review appeal was dismissed. The court found that the application for judicial review was premature and that a balancing of interests was required. The applicant for judicial or quasi-judicial review requires a level of professionalism and the court was not led to conclude that the applicant's complaints were inappropriate and premature. The issues raised on appeal were whether the Court should have the opportunity to address them in the first instance, whether the Commission was in the best position and had the statutory discretion to perform that balancing, and whether the application to the courts should be allowed at the preliminary stage."

The appellant contends that he was unaware that an accident had taken place until he returned from the store and the finding of the trial judge that the appellant must have known an accident took place before entering the store is contrary to the preponderance of evidence.

It was the Court's view that the hearing officer had jurisdiction to hear and determine the matter in issue. The notice of appeal and arguments presented by the tenant all relate to the facts as found by the hearing officer and contain no error of law.

The father applied for interim custody and the mother replied, seeking sole custody. Children to remain with the mother until the end of the school year, at which point primary care of the children will be granted to the applicant; child support adjusted accordingly. The mother's decision to move was not in the children's best interests and it was done either to frustrate or with a callous indifference to the children's relationship with their father.","The parties, who were married in 1993 and separated in May 2005, applied to vary the existing order.

This order was amended to provide that the parties would have joint custody with primary residence to the respondent when the parties moved to Bridgewater. The application to vary this order was granted. The children were school aged and had some extracurricular activities. The father had access to Bridgewater but it was now closed to him.

7_2006nspc61.txt,"A young person who suffered from considerable mental health issues and was in the permanent care of the Minister of Community Services applied to have the court exclude the public and the media from her court convened pre- sentencing conference. The purpose of the conference was to assemble various professionals from diverse fields to discuss the complex issues surrounding the young person and to provide recommendations to the court as to an appropriate sentence. Various of the professionals had expressed their concern as to their ability to participate in the conference if the media was present. Application for access by the media denied; order granted excluding the public and the media from the pre-sentencing conference; the benefits of an exclusion order outweigh the deleterious effect of restricting the public's right to freedom of expression and the freedom of the press. Although the court convened hearing is a public proceeding to which, prima facie, the open court principle applies, the attendance, cooperation and participation of the invitees to the conference (all professionals who were bound by laws, policies and agreements of confidentiality) was strictly voluntary and many, if not all, would be unable and unwilling to participate in a conference that was open to the public and the media. The administration of justice was furthered by the court obtaining the best possible information from those identified as best able to provide it so that recommendations flowing from the conference would lead to the best sentence for the youth. There were no alternative measures which would prevent or reduce the risk of non-participation by the professionals.","Counsel for the young person applied for an exclusion order from attending a youth court pre-sentencing conference. The youth person entered or confirmed guilty pleas to 31 offences involving assaultive behaviour, threats, property damage and breach of court orders in relation to group home placements. The issue was whether the public, including the media, should be permitted to attend the conference. Counsel for the youth person made an application under s. 132 of the Youth Criminal Justice Act requesting that the court exclude the public and the media from the conference scheduled to take place at the end of December. The Crown, the young people and the defendant sought a ruling from the court as to whether the general public and media should be allowed to attend. The parties argued that the conference should not be open to the public or the media. Application dismissed; the use of conferences to deal with youth in conflict with the criminal law is statutorily authorized by the Youth Court. The legislation attempts to protect the privacy interests through the non-publication provisions, the restrictions on access to records and judicial discretion to exclude members of the public from proceedings if such exclusion is necessary to prevent a serious risk to the proper administration of justice. The court found that the public's right to attend any court proceedings subject to the discretion of the court to exclude them is an extraordinary remedy and great care must be exercised in deciding whether to use this discretion. The open court principle is not absolute. It is subject to considerations set out in s.132 and in the Dagenais/Mentuck test. The burden of displacing the general rule of openness lies on the party making the application. The public and other members of society in the protection and rehabilitation of young people involved in youth court proceedings is a value of such superordinate importance that it justifies the discretion given to a youth Court judge under s.(e) 39(1)(a) of the Young Criminal Justice act. The Act provides for the creation of a 'closed court order' that allows the disclosure of information about youth offenders and their rehabilitation. The exclusion order is based on the principle that all professionals are required to participate in the process of justice, which is a continuum of democratic society and applies to all judicial proceedings. The principles of the 'open court principle' and 'open access' are central to the judicial process and must be balanced in the context of the broad principles of justice and the 'diversity of interests' that guide the judicial system. The 'openness' is inextricably linked to the freedom of expression,"
c_2000skqb232.txt,"FIAT. The husband seeks to vary the spousal support provisions of the parties' 1975 separation agreement. This agreement held that the sum of $550 (adjusted for inflation) is to be paid to the wife until she dies or remarries, whichever comes first. The applicant paid this amount (except for a unilateral deduction in 1995) for over 25 years. The basis of his application is that he is now retired and earning less income. In addition, the respondent now earns part-time income that she did not have at the time of the agreement. At the time of the agreement, the wife raised the couple's five children and received child support from the applicant. HELD: The application is dismissed with costs to the respondent. The SCC has held that in order for a Court to vary support provisions in a valid settlement, separation agreement or consent order, a material or radical change in circumstances causally connected to the marriage needs to be established. Retirement of one of the parties was reasonably foreseeable at the time they entered into the agreement. It was also foreseeable that retirement income is most often less than employment income. This is not the kind of radical unforeseen change in circumstance required to vary the support. The preamble of the parties' agreement states that they intended it to be a complete and final settlement. The applicant has always earned considerable income and continues to have a better standard of living than the respondent. The respondent's modest income does not provide grounds to vary the agreement as she still has a much lower standard of living that the applicant, even after receiving the spousal support.","FIAT. The husband applied to vary the spousal support provisions contained in a separation agreement dated June 18, 1975. By virtue of paragraph 4(a) of the agreement the parties agreed the initial sum of $550 would be paid for spousousal and further agreed that a reduction in the husband's income as a consequence was or was reasonably foreseeable at the time the agreement was entered into. The agreement provided for annual adjustments to the spouse amount payable based upon the increase in the Consumer Price Index. The wife was 64 years old and retired and drove a 1978 vehicle that was in need repair. The applicant was a graduate professional and was the founder and partner in an engineering firm. He had always earned a considerable income although he deposed to a number of substantial business investment losses in the United States.

The retirement of his current income was reasonably recent and was reasonably likely at the current time. She still had a much lower standard of living than the applicant even after taking into account the amount she is receiving as spousa support. The fact it had now occurred is not that kind of radical unforseen change required to be established upon the authorities to support the variation application. Nor was it persuaded that the modest income of the wife provided any proper ground for variation of the Agreement.

The trustee maintained the bankrupt was repeatedly advised or cautioned that bankruptcy may not affect the majority of his creditors. Subsequent appraisals placed the value of his unfinished home at $150,000 rather than $40,000. The bankrupt was now eligible to obtain mortgage financing but first had to get out of bankruptcy. The bankrupt had attempted an orderly payment of debts prior to bankruptcy and had considered proposal post-bankruptcy. HELD: The application for an order annulling the assignment was dismissed. 1)The bankrupt met the definition of an insolvent person at the date of the assignment. It would be dangerous to set a precedent which would allow such an application because of post-bankruptcy circumstances. An improved financial situation and the ability to pay debts in full should not be used as criteria to launch section181 application. 2)The bankrupt had not filed monthly financial statements nor made payments as agreed to cover the costs of the administration of the estate.

e_1999skqb151.txt,"The farm implement dealer and the defendant entered a standard form Finance Lease Agreement which provided for an 'advance payment' and semi-annual installments with the final 'termination value' payment to be paid at the defendant's option if he elected to purchase the sprayer. The central issue was whether the Agreement was a lease and liquidated damages should be awarded in accordance with clause two, or a conditional sales security agreement whereby the dealer was restricted to repossession and sale by s.46(2) of the Saskatchewan Farm Security Act. HELD: The plaintiff's claim was dismissed with costs on Column 3. 1)The Agreement was a conditional sales contract whereby title was reserved until the defendant elected to make the final payment. The transaction falls within the ambit of the Saskatchewan Farm Security Act and the dealer's right to recover the unpaid purchase price is restricted to repossession and sale. Although the dealer framed the Agreement as a lease the Agreement itself used notions of retail financing and secured party. Nomenclature such as principal, past due interest, conditional sales contract, purchase of equipment, and retail sales contract were used. The construction and interpretation of the nature of the Agreement is a question of law. The Agreement had many attributes of ownership and collectively showed that the defendant acquired a substantial interest in the sprayer. He had possession and unrestricted right to use the sprayer with high base hours. The total payments were equivalent to the total payments under sales contract. The defendant had the option to acquire title by making the final payment. He bore the risk of loss and obligation for maintenance and insurance. 2)The court could not determine whether the option price would be substantially less, equal or more than the June 2002 fair market value of the sprayer. 3)If the Agreement is lease the defendant's consent to give up possession was conditional upon his release from further liability. Case Credit cannot foreclose the entitlement to 40 days notice and take possession of the sprayer by relying upon conditional unwritten consent. To validate early repossession would defeat the intention of the legislation to protect creditors. Case could take possession only in accordance with Part IV of the SFSA. 4)If the Agreement is lease and covered by the SFSA, the defendant would be released from all liability under s.55. It would be unjust to make any further order in a summary trial without the benefit of discoveries or pre-trial conference and without evidence of the fair market value at the time of seizure. 5)If the Agreement is lease and not covered by the SFSA, it would be held that the dealer was not barred by implied acceptance of the condition the defendant be released from further liability because of the exclusionary clause. Judgment would have been granted for $42,089 with costs on Column 3.","The primary issue was whether the Agreement was a lease or a security agreement. The central issue was between the parties whether the agreement was a leasing or a conditional sales agreement. HELD: The plaintiff's claim was dismissed. The defendant was awarded costs on the basis of Column D of the Tariff of Costs. 1)The issue was not plead in defence but in the framework of a summary trial. The parties did canvass the circumstances within the framework without the benefit of discovery or pre-trial conference. It would be unjust to make any further order under the Act in these circumstances and in the absence of an evidentiary basis, for example, of the fair market value of the sprayer at the time of the seizure as required for an order under s. 55(c) of the Act. 2)The Agreement had many of the attributes of a lease, but the Agreement did not define it in that way. The trade-in did not equal the value of a sprayer. 3)The agreement had many attributes of ownership. The owner was to have possession and the unrestricted right to use the sprayers provided he did not exceed 500 base hours annually. The base hours were high and it was reasonably expected that the annual usage would be less than the base hours. The sprayer was used (not new) and the evidence was that new unit would sell for approximately $120,000. It was also used to acquire title by making the final termination value payment. 4)The termination value of $23,650 did not appear to be a nominal amount but in absence of evidence, was unable to determine whether it was a'substantial sum' as being the test employed in the Ontario Equipment case. The option payment of $25,650 was not a nominal sum but in light of the evidence that it depends on market fluctuations, cannot determine whether the value would be substantially less than $94,600 in June 2002 or equivalent to it, or more. 5)The plaintiff was awarded $42,089.00 with costs on a basis of column D of Tariff Of Costs.  6)The defendant was to bear the risk of loss and obligations for maintenance and insurance. The court must be able to ascertain the probable value of his sprayer in June, 2002 and in light that it depended on market fluctuation, cannot decide whether the option price would be substantial or more than the fair value in June 2003 or more and must be a 'diminished sum' test employed by the Ontario case. 7)The agreements had many"
c_2008skca28.txt,"The appellant agreed to buy a two-story condominium unit from the respondent developer. The building permit had not been obtained, nor had condominium titles been raised at the time the sale agreement was entered into. In the course of construction the respondent opted not to proceed with the two-story unit, revising it to a single story unit which was offered to the appellant. The appellant did not accept the offer, and registered a miscellaneous interest against the title to the entire parcel of land. The appellant sues for specific performance of the agreement and in the alternative, damages. The developer succeeded in obtaining a court order discharging the miscellaneous interest. The Court's jurisdiction to hear the appeal is found in s. 111 of The Land Titles Act, 2000. The issue is whether the appellant possessed an interest in land so as to support the registration of a miscellaneous interest. HELD: Appeal dismissed.  1) Before a condominium plan as defined in The Condominium Property Act, 1993 comes into being, there is nothing in the Act which directly or inferentially entertains the prospect that a purchase of a 'proposed unit' can constitute an interest in land, or a registrable interest for the purposes of s. 50 of The Land Titles Act, 2000. 2) The Act expressly prohibits the registration of any charge against the common property. The appellant is not entitled to rest his claim to a registrable interest in the surface parcel on the basis of a notional claim to rights in 'common property'. Common property, by definition, does not come into existence until the condominium plan comes into effect. 3) For the purposes of s. 50 of The Land Titles Act, 2000, the appellant had no basis in law, or under The Condominium Property Act, 1993 for asserting an interest against the surface parcel owned by the respondent.","The appellant agreed to purchase a two-storey condominium unit from the respondent, developer. It was the only planned unit of its kind in the warehouse the developer proposed to convert to a 26 unit condominium. The developer decided not to proceed with the two-story unit, revising it instead to a single story unit (Unit 5). The appellant registered a miscellaneous interest against the title to the entire parcel of land on which the warehouse stood. The respondent later sold the unit to third party purchaser for damages. The appellant appealed. The preliminary question is whether the appellant possessed an interest in land. The Chambers judge did not err in the result as the appellant at no time possessed a registrable interest in the surface parcel. It is unnecessary to address the issue whether specific performance was available to the appellant. The transaction of purchase and sale may never be completed. HELD: Appeal dismissed with costs. 1) Despite the manner in which the issues have been framed by the appellant, the preliminary question was whether the respondent possessed an 'interest in land'. The appellant was not entitled to rest his claim to a registrarable interest on the basis of a notional claim to rights in 'common property' as the Chambers judge failed to err in finding that the appellant had no interest in any land.  2) The respondent had not filed a statement of defence at the time it made the application and the issues lacked refinement. The determination of appropriate remedies was premature at that stage of the proceedings."

If an offender is exempted from payment of the victim surcharge, it is also mandatory that the Court give reasons. The sentence is varied to include an order requiring the respondent to pay a victim surcharge in the amount of $30.","The Crown appealed the sentence of $200.00 for breach of probation and a $200 fine. The sentence was varied to include an order requiring the respondent to pay a victim surcharge in the amount of $30. The sentencing judge waived the surcharge on the basis the respondent did not comply with the mandatory provisions of s. 737 of the Code. HELD: The sentence is varied toinclude an order required the respondentto pay a Victim surcharge of $ 30. The surcharge was waived notwithstanding that the respondent had not requested an exemption pursuant to s. 730 of the Criminal Code (the 'Code'). The Crown gave reasons for the reasons for their decision. 1) The sentencing Judge consistently raised the maximum amount of surcharges in the criminal justice system, particularly in the context of undue hardship. He consistently raised important and important issues in the trial and throughout the sentencing process. His decision to vary the sentence was important in that it was consistent with the maximum surcharge set out in s. 687 of the code. His sentencing decision was important because it established that the Respondent had to pay surcharges of $20.30 in addition to the usual surcharges. He also established that victim surcharges are made in circumstances where the maximum number of surcharge payments are made per victim is 15 per cent. He was also required to give reasons for his decisions.  2) The trial judge raised important but not life-changing issues which are of particular importance to the victim. His sentence was also varied to add an order that the defendant pay a $30 victim sur charge in the sum of $300."

The appellant's memorandum of law and oral argument only addressed whether the police officer had reasonable and probable ground to arrest and demand his breath sample and asserted a violation of his rights pursuant to s. 8 and 9 Charter of Rights. HELD: The appeal was dismissed. The trial judge tested the officer's credibility and the judge's conclusion was supported by facts. The officer's belief was based on the observation that the appellant was driving with a flat tire, with windshield wipers operating on a clear night, as well as slurred speech and bloodshot eyes. The officer had reasonable and probable grounds to demand a sample of the appellant's breath.","An appeal from a conviction in the Provincial Court of Saskatchewan that the appellant did, having consumed alcohol in such a quantity that the concentration thereof in his blood exceeded 80 milligrams of alcohol in 100 milliliters of blood, operate a motor vehicle contrary to s.255(1) and s.253(b) of the Criminal Code. HELD: The appeal was dismissed. 1) The trial judge was in a position to test the credibility of the trial judge. In coming to his conclusion he considered the totality of the evidence, the trial court considered the facts. The trial court found that the trial officer had reasonable and probable grounds to demand a sample of the appellant's breath, and the appellant’s claim for breach of the Charter failed. 2) The officer was in the position to assess the credibilityof the trial Judge. In come to his conclusions he considered whether the trial law reflected reasonable and likely grounds. 3) The evidence was not clear that the officer observed the bloodshot eyes of the respondent after making the formal arrest as argued by the appellant. The appellant was in position to Test the credibility OF THE trial judge in coming to the conclusion he consider the totalityof the evidence. The evidence is supported by the facts and the trial judges’ decision was reasonable and supported by all the evidence except for the blood. The respondent’ s.8 Charter rights were violated. 4) The court found with respect to the appellant that the appeal was not supported by what the trial jurist concluded was reasonable, supported by evidence such as the blood, eyes, slurred speech, bloodshot ears, slurring speech and were ample evidence to support her belief the appellant was operating his motor vehicle while his ability to do so was impaired. 5) Even excluding the slurred, blood-shot eyes, the remaining indicia which the trialist observed provided ample evidence of support her believe the appellant operated his motor Vehicle while his Ability to do So was impaired and the appeal for breach thereof failed. 6) The appeal court found the trial justice was correct. The officer had valid and probable reasons to demand the breath sample. The subjective element in determining whether she had reasonable or probable grounds for making the demand is not present. The court determined that the respondent had reasonable, probable grounds and therefore had reasonable grounds to make the demand. The Court found that she had no reasonable and reasonable grounds and the respondent”s claim against breach of her Charter must fail."
5_2007skpc74.txt,"Decision, following a voir dire, on the admissibility of statements made by the accused to a police officer, beginning with: 'Excuse me, I was in a roll-over accident and I am intoxicated.' The officer, who observed symptoms of impairment, asked the accused how much he had had to drink and was told he had consumed about 15 beers. The officer placed the accused under arrest for impaired operation of a motor vehicle, and read him his Charter rights, the Police Warning and a Demand for Blood Sample. The officer then detained the accused by remaining with him while awaiting the Blood Kit to arrive and for a blood technician to take the blood. During this time, the officer interrogated the accused about the accident and the accused provided additional information. The Crown contended that if he was given the police warning then it would be clear to the accused that he did not have to continue to answer questions the officer's questions. The Defence argued that since the arrest and the blood demand were based upon self-incriminating evidence obtained by breach of the accused's s. 7 rights, the arrest was illegal and all evidence obtained thereafter should be excluded; or, at least, that the information obtained was illegally obtained and the police could not rely on that information to make the demand. The accused testified that he talked to the police officer only because he believed he had a legal obligation to do so, based on advice he had received from others that there was a legal obligation to report the accident promptly to the police. The Crown conceded that the accused did have a legal obligation to report the accident promptly, and that if the accused believed he was reporting the accident when he gave self-incriminating statements to the police officer as a result of that belief, those statements must be excluded according to law. HELD: All of the statements of the accused, including those made after the arrest, are excluded and will not form part of the Crown's case. The evidence obtained, and the statements, in particular, were self-incriminating and conscriptive. The officer was acting in good faith, not with serious intentional disregard of the accused's rights. He was not taking a statement under the Traffic Safety Act. He did not know that the accused was only saying things because he believed he had to under compulsion of statute. Even though the investigator did nothing that violated the accused's rights, they were nevertheless violated. Because the violation resulted in the making of statements that amounted to self-incriminating evidence, following the logic of the case law, it is necessary to exclude those statements. The accused did approach the police officer with the intention of reporting the accident as is required by the Traffic Safety Act. As such, and as the Crown correctly concedes, his initial statement, anything said by the accused while providing his personal information and the answer to any question while registering at the hospital are excluded from this trial. As the self-incriminating statements made under compulsion of statute have been excluded, it follows that any evidence that came about as a result of the officer following up on those excluded statements are also in breach of the accused's s. 7 rights.","The accused was charged with impaired operation, driving over.08 and breach of his s.7 rights. The voir dire was held following a voir net on the admissibility of statements made by the accused to a police officer. The accused made self-incriminating statements to the officer as a result of his belief in his obligation to report the accident. HELD: The accused's statements were excluded from evidence at trial as they were self- incriminating and did not amount to anything more than a violation of his rights. There was nothing in the statements that were made under compulsion of statute or that the officer could rely on them to make the demand. The statements were made in good faith and were believed to be made in a reasonable manner. There were no lies or distortions of truth, neither of which was accepted by the defence. The admission of the statements was fair and would be clear to the accused that he did not have to continue to answer questions of the officer."
7_2018skca42.txt,"Criminal Law – Murder – Second Degree Murder – Conviction – AppealEvidence – Unsavoury Witnesses – Vetrovec Warning – Charge to Jury The appellant had been found guilty of second degree murder following a trial before a judge and jury. He appealed on the ground that the trial judge had failed to give the jury a Vetrovec warning regarding the testimony of his former common law spouse (S.S.) and a witness who had been his friend (W.D.) who was the source of the gun used in the shooting of the victim. The appellant’s trial counsel had initially identified the need for the judge to issue the warning because W.D. had an interest in the outcome because there were outstanding charges against him and because there was the potential that S.S.would be charged too, she would also have an interest in the case as well. During the pre-charge conference with defence counsel and the Crown, the trial judge noted that in giving the warning to the jury he would also have to convey a summary of the Crown’s confirmatory evidence. The defence counsel then withdrew his application. The victim had been a friend of the appellant. According to S.S.’s testimony, the appellant and the victim had pre-arranged a meeting in an abandoned farmyard. The victim worked as an automated teller machine (ATM) technician and as part of his job, he travelled between ATMs carrying cash. S.S. did not see what happened between the two men but heard two gunshots and then saw the appellant and the victim point guns at each other. She saw the victim on his knees pleading with the appellant and offering money in exchange for his life. The appellant instructed her to collect the money and the victim’s cellphone and place them in his truck and while she was doing so, she heard another gunshot and saw the victim lying face down and the appellant standing over him holding a gun. As she and the appellant left the scene, the appellant gave her the victim’s gun. The appellant hid the other guns and the money at another farm site and then dumped the victim’s cellphone and ammunition in a farm field. Apart from the handguns, none of the other items were ever recovered. The witness remained in a relationship with the appellant for another four years following the crime until November 2013. She was contacted by the police in February 2013 and denied any knowledge of the incident. At trial, S.S. testified that she was afraid of the appellant and he had warned her that as an accomplice, she was as involved as he was. When the RCMP contacted her again in May 2014, she again denied any knowledge but then told the officer what she knew because she felt safer and would receive protection from the appellant. S.S. did not have a criminal record, nor was she charged with any offence arising from this incident. The appellant testified that during the meeting in the farmyard, the victim produced two handguns and they began to test fire the weapons. The victim suggested that they stage a fake robbery. The appellant would rough up his friend and then take the cash from his truck. The victim became quite aggressive after the appellant hit him too hard and began chasing him with one of his guns. S.S. then took one of the guns and shot the victim three times. She took $23,000 in cash from his truck because she had financial problems. The testimony of W.D. was that the appellant had acquired two handguns, a Glock and a .22 calibre handgun, from him, ostensibly on behalf of another friend. Several days later, the appellant returned both handguns and reported that after his friend began to shoot at him with the .22 calibre, he had returned fired and shot him three times. On the appellant’s insistence, the witness changed the barrel of the Glock handgun several months later. The police arrested W.D. and charged him with unspecified offences arising from the incident. In the appellant’s version, he testified that the victim brought the guns to the meeting and assumed that he acquired them from W.D. He therefore returned them to W.D. after the incident and requested that he change the barrel on the Glock to protect W.D. HELD: The appeal was dismissed. The court found that the trial judge had not erred by not giving the Vetrovec warning. It was not mandatory for him to do so regardless of the position of the defence counsel. The judge was aware of the need for such a warning in the circumstances and after consulting with the Crown and the defence, he exercised his discretion to decide that he would not instruct the jury. The judge was aware that the defence counsel withdrew his application as a tactical decision to avoid having the judge repeat the Crown’s confirmatory evidence to the jury. The judge’s exercise of his discretion was entitled to deference.","The defendant was found guilty of the second degree murder of his common law spouse, who was his former common law wife. The evidence implicating the defendant in the murder was from the testimony of two former common laws spouses, Susan Saxon and Dwight Windrum. The trial judge did not give a Vetrovec warning to either spouse, but instead suggested that the trial judge give a warning to the defendant's former common lawyer spouse, Susan Windrum, and her friend, Dwight Windrums. The defendant appealed. Appeal dismissed; the defendant was sentenced to life imprisonment with no eligibility for parole for 12 years; the appellate court found that the defendant had erred in law in failing to give a proper warning to both his formercommon law spouse and to the jury as to dangers inherent in his testimony. The court also found that there was no error in the trial court's approach by the defendant as to the use of the term 'jury protection' in reference to his testimony as to his co-accused."
b_2004skqb105.txt,"FIAT: The defendant applied for security for costs in the amount of $50,000. HELD: The plaintiff was required to supply security for costs in the amount of $18,000. 1) The defendant proved facts, which demonstrated the existence of several of the criteria listed in Rule 538 of the Queen's Bench Rules of Court. The plaintiff failed to establish any of the situations listed in Rule 539.  2) The presence of a counterclaim does not necessarily or automatically prohibit the granting of an order for security for costs. Rather, it is a factor to be considered. In this case, the counterclaim was not a wholly distinct claim. It arises in respect of the same matter and transaction as the claim proper. 3) The defendant commenced the builders' lien action, long before filing a defence and counterclaim within this action. Had the counterclaim not been filed, an order for security for costs as requested would have been appropriate. It is somewhat artificial to now deny that relief because of the counterclaim, which has the effect of facilitating a disposition of all matters within one proceeding. 4) The plaintiff applied ex parte under s. 56(1) of The Builders' Lien Act to have the defendant's lien vacated. The application was granted, but the plaintiff was required to post security for costs in the amount of $50,000. The Builders' Lien Act does not impede the jurisdiction of this Court to deal with the application of the defendant.","FIAT. The defendant applied to have the plaintiff's lien vacated. The applicant brought an application to have it ordered to provide security for costs in the amount of $50,000. The application was granted but the plaintiff was required to post security for cost in the lesser amount of money. The plaintiff counterclaimed for $50k. The respondent commenced the builders' lien action in the province of Alberta which is the other action in this case. The defendants commenced the action in January 1999. The builders' Lien was registered against certain lands respecting work done. In March 2000 the defendant filed a defence and counterclaim. The latter asserts a claim for $2,150,495.65 for services and materials provided to the plaintiff pursuant to the contract. The counterclaim is based on an allegation of breach of trust by the defendant in failing to rectify certain sub-soil conditions which were frustrating the work and eventually directed the defendant to vacate the site. The judge reviewed the case law and found that the presence of the counterclaim did not preclude an order for security for Costs. The court ordered the security posted in the amounts of $18,000 for fees and disbursements. The issue was whether the presence would have an adverse effect on the plaintiff if the security was restricted to costs for the defence of the claim proper. HELD: The judge's decision was that the court has discretion and the matter should be vacated only where it has determined that the parties acting in the same fashion are not wholly distinct from the claim. The presence of a counterclaim does not necessarily preclude an application for security. The matter raised by the respondent is certainly not wholly separate from the claims of the plaintiffs. All matters arising out of the same motor vehicle accident and include all the parties involved in that accident. The Court will do what is just and fair in the circumstances.  1) The presence is only an application in a fashion which allows the court to look to the overall situation in order to decide what is Just and Fair. 2) The judge carefully considered the pleadings and the material filed. He did not allow the judge to impose any order for costs. The decision was based on the fact that the plaintiff had already paid out its lien in Alberta and had not filed a claim to the defendant's liens. The determination that the judge had discretion to impose costs where the claim was not wholly different from the plaintiff else's claim would have been improper. 3) The defendant commenced the builder's lense action which is"

The terms of the settlement and the sum paid were not to be disclosed. Beyond the issue of privilege which was a complete answer to the request, revisiting that action was a more critical problem.

The issues raised in the application were complicated and not at all clear in their implications. The judge did not intend to do so.

The Crown sought a sentence of 1/2 to years for the offence, based on the factors of sentencing. The accused was sentenced to 18 months in a provincial correctional centre.

The Court found that a lower sentence would be justified given the accused's previous criminal record and that he had given up alcohol. The court found that the accused had no prior criminal record. The actions were totally out of repeated. The victim suffered bruising and soreness from the incident and was hospitalized for counselling. The property damage and vandalism had no connection to the offence. A lower sentenced was warranted given the circumstances of the offence such as the accused was a model citizen, who had quit drinking, accepted that alcohol was not only the major factor in the commission of the sexual assault, but also the accused’s prior criminal records.

She also held that one cannot ignore the phrase 'pursuant to Article 28 or 26', read it out of existence nor re-write it and that if the words were given their ordinary meaning the interpretation was patently unreasonable. HELD: The appeal was dismissed. 1)The trial judge did not err in concluding the majority decision of the Board of Arbitration was patently unreasonable. Its decision rested upon an interpretation of the collective bargaining agreement that the words of the agreement could not reasonably bear. 2)No material error was found in her analysis in finding that the decision was fundamentally flawed or in her analysis of the phrase 'pursuant to Article 28'. Nor in her identification or application of the governing standard of review. DISSENT: The appeal would have been allowed. 1)There was no dispute that the central issue, the reviewability of the board's interpretation, requires an application of the test prescribed by Shalansky. The Chambers judge did not follow that approach. Once it is accepted that there are two reasonable constructions, the suggestion of a reviewable error of law in consensual arbitration disappears. The decision can only be set aside if it involves an interpretation the words of the agreement could not reasonably bear. The patently unreasonable test is a very strict test. 2)The judge was wrong to use the Melford decision to support her conclusion that the Pool interpretation was the only one which the words of the collective agreement could reasonably bear. 3)Once the ordinary meaning of the words 'pursuant to' must be set aside by reason of their context in Article 16, the decision by an adjudicator to choose either 'for the purposes of' or 'subject to' is motivated more by the result desired rather than by fine legal principles of interpretation.

The R.M. had agreed with the mortgagor that its mortgage would be subordinate to that of FCC. The appeal raises the application of the priority provisions of The Land Titles Act, 2000 and in particular the application of s. 54 of the Act. HELD: The mortgage of the respondent has priority over the mortgage of the appellant. The appeal is dismissed with costs.  1) It is not necessary in this case to consider whether the priority provisions of the Land Titles Act are overridden by commercial postponement agreements in mortgages, or whether reliance by the competing security holder is necessary in order to displace the doctrine of privity of contract in relation to a covenant to postpone, for the court consider the matter to be governed by a consideration of the nature of the interest created by the R.M. mortgage in light of s. 54(3) of the Act. 2) Registration does not and cannot alter the nature of the legal interest granted by the instrument registered. In the present case the mortgage instrument states that it is pursuant to the prior Grant Agreement executed by the parties. This agreement, in turn, clearly provides that any security granted by Mainline to the R.M. is subject to the prior security interest of the respondent to the extent of $3,125,000. In effect, Mainline granted to the R.M. a mortgage of a limited interest, being Mainline's equity of redemption after any mortgage held by the respondent, to the extent of $3,125,000. The appellant admits that it was never intended, as between itself and Mainline, that it would obtain a security interest in priority to that of the respondent. Mainline granted a mortgage to the appellant subject to the prior interests, as defined, of the respondent and of CIBC.

The trial judge held that the trial judge's conclusion that the fee simple mortgage of a respondent has priority over the respondent's fee simple home mortgage is not arguable. The appellant knew that third parties in the position of the appellant did and would place substantial reliance on such subordination provisions. The fact that the respondent paid the respondent a fee to implement the project and the RSM agreed to another one, which was a postponing, did not affect the appellant's ability to enforce its security interest. The second FCC Mortgage had priority over its mortgage of another interest, as the respondent only agreed to one postponement and the mortgage was not registered before a mortgage of any kind."
8_2015skqb6.txt,"HELD: This was an extraordinary event for all of the accused and nothing in the evidence suggested that they required rehabilitation or that incarceration would assist in rehabilitation. The victim did not provide a victim impact statement, but the court concluded that the event would have been terrifying for him. The gravity of the offence was high given the maximum sentence of life imprisonment. The court found the following mitigating factors: 1) guilty pleas; 2) the event was not planned in advance, it was prompted by alcohol use; 3) the assault was serious but brief; 4) the accused were all employed and contributing members of society; 5) the accused all accepted responsibility for the offence; and 6) the accused all complied with strict release conditions for three years. The aggravating factors were: 1) s. 348.1 of the Criminal Code was applicable to all accused even though their level of participation differed; 2) they entered the victim’s residence by breaking a window; 3) the crime was intense; 3) two of three accused had weapons and used them on the victim; and 4) the victim had some lasting injuries from losing three to four teeth. The court was prepared to extend leniency to the accused; however, some period of incarceration was found necessary to meet the objectives of deterrence and denunciation. A.H. was sentenced to 10 months incarceration, J.M. to 11 months incarceration, and N.F. to 12 months less a day incarceration for the break and enter charge and one year consecutive incarceration on the s. 85(2) charge. All accused were given an 18-month probation period to follow their incarceration. Terms of the probation included counselling as required and no contact with the victim.","HELD: The Court sentenced the three accused pursuant to s. 267(b) and s. 348(1)(b) of the Criminal Code to imprisonment for common assault. The Court found that the three had acted in good faith and were at low risk to re-offend. The offences occurred over a period of 13 days. The three accused admitted to the offence, and gave a statement to the police shortly after their arrest. They were assessed as being at medium risk to reapply for the offence. The accused also admitted to having a pellet gun in their possession. The Crown sought a DNA order, a firearms prohibition and a forfeiture order in relation to the imitation firearm. The first accused was sentenced to 12 days imprisonment. The second accused was given a sentence of 1 year to 18 months. The sentences were varied but the offences occurred quickly and intensely. The third accused, who had a previous criminal record for driving while over.08, had been in custody for 13 days prior to his arrest. The offence was considered a fit for imprisonment."
2_2011nssc290.txt,"Rule 85.04 – Order for confidentiality The parties moved under Rule 59.60 to have the court seal their file after media asked to view it. They didn't ask to exclude the public from the hearing, nor did they seek a publication ban.  , the file will be sealed. While Rule 59.60 doesn't provide guidance on when it would be appropriate to seal a file, Rule 85.04(1) does. The SCC decision of Dagenais (and related cases) applies. A confidentiality order should only be granted when: necessary to prevent a serious risk to an important interest; there are no less intrusive measures available; and the benefits outweigh the costs. Personal embarrassment or damage to a party's reputation isn't enough. Here, the important public interest is the protection of personal identifiers (e.g. SIN's, addresses, bank account numbers and other personal information required on court documents). Having these identifiers accessible to members of the public can result in identity theft, which is a real and serious concern. The court is able to take judicial notice of the fact society values the prevention of identity theft (and that it exists in the first place). There are no less intrusive measures to prevent access to this personal information that aren't cumbersome and costly for the parties and court administration staff. The salutary effects of a sealing order outweigh its deleterious effects, especially since the public will still be permitted to access the court hearing and any decision that is rendered. The open court principle was crafted at a time when the internet wasn't a public source of information and manipulation.","The parties had both requested an order to seal the contents of their divorce file. The petitioner had requested that the file be sealed as a condition of its filing. The respondent had also requested that all documents in the file should be sealed, treated as confidential and not made available to the public. The applicant and respondent had both sought sealing of the file in response to a request from the media to examine it. The media request was made according to the provisions of Civil Procedure Rule 59.60. The parties had each sought disclosure and requested that their files be sealed in order to protect their reputation, their reputation against unproven allegations, and the public interest in an open court. The filing of documents in this case was a serious issue and would require a significant amount of preparation and time. The court had a duty to protect the public's expectation that personal identifiers would be kept private and confidential. The public interest, especially in relation to marriage, was important but the sealing order did not provide sufficient evidence to support the public expectation that such information would be provided. The sealing order was also a serious step in the wrong direction. The applicants had to demonstrate that the court had not created a closed legal framework by which information could be freely shared. The application to seal all of the files was dismissed because the public had not been informed of the potential for abuse by the media. The sufficiency of the sealing orders did not serve to create a vacuum in the open court process. The salutary effects of a sealing order do outweigh their deleterious effects because the general public interest is not completely circumscribed by the order."
b_2013skqb265.txt,"The appellant landlord appealed a decision of the Residential Tenancies hearing officer. The tenancy in question had commenced in April 2012. On September 18, the tenant had given six weeks' notice of her intention to terminate the tenancy. The term of the lease stated that it was for a term of 12 months (April 2012 to March 2013) and continuing thereafter from month to month until one of the parties gave one month's notice. The appellant did not try to rent the premises following receipt of the notice because he had decided to furnish the unit prior to re-renting. He spent $15,000 doing so and advertised the unit in mid-January, increasing the rent by $400 and obtained a new tenant as at February 1. Although it is not stated what relief the landlord sought from the Office of Residential Tenancies, the hearing officer stated in the decision that the lease was a month-to-month tenancy. The appellant argued that the hearing officer made errors in law in that he 1) misinterpreted s. 19(1)(g)(iii) of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 in making that finding, as the lease was for a fixed term; and 2) misinterpreted s. 8(2) of the Act in finding that the landlord's efforts at mitigation were not reasonable within the meaning of the section and the landlord was legally disentitled by s. 8(1) of the Act. HELD: The Court held that the hearing officer had erred in law in finding that the lease was for a month-to-month tenancy. The one-month-notice provision only applied if the tenancy was extended beyond the fixed term. The appeal was allowed on this issue. The Court found that the decision of the landlord to furnish the premises was a business decision, and the result of this decision could not be attributed to the tenant. The Court dismissed the appellant's claim for loss.","The appellant landlord appealed a decision of the Residential Tenancies Hearing Officer in finding that the tenancy agreement was not a fixed-term agreement and that the landlord is legally disentitled to compensation pursuant to s. 8(1) of the Act. HELD: The appeal was dismissed. 1) The tenant did not attempt to rent the premises following his receipt of the notice prior to re-renting it. He spent approximately $15,000 on furnishing the unit and himself spent approximately 15,000 dollars on the process. The tenant obtained a new tenant effective February 1, 2013 at $2500 per month. 2) The hearing officer erred in holding that a month-to-month tenancy would follow the primary fixed term negated a fixed term. The one-month notice provision referred to in the term of the lease was applicable only if the tenancy was extended to a month to month tenancy following the end of the fixed term (i.e. if the tenant had not complained to the landlord about the noise). The one month notice provision was applicable in the lease only if it was extended beyond the end term (vi). 3) The Hearing Officer erred by holding that the fact a monthto- month tenancy would followed the primary primary fixed Term negated an fixed term and that a one- month notice provisions were applicable only in the sense of the term in the case of Morguard Residential Inc. v. Adams. The appellant did not succeed in advertising the unit for rent until the middle of January 2013. None of this macro decision can be attributed to the respondent. None can be said to be a macro decision based on his business going forward. None could be attributed either to the tenant or to the employer. 4) The respondent chose to take the same position as the appellant and chose to rent within the space of six weeks."
b_2018skpc52.txt,"/n The accused was charged with violating s. 7(2)(b) of the Saskatchewan Fishery Regulations, 1995 by unlawfully fishing in an area of Canoe Lake, specifically Jans Bay, that had been closed to all fishing since 1993 because of overfishing by the local commercial fishery industry. The accused, a status Indian with Aboriginal and Treaty 10 rights, was fishing for food. He had used a net in the restricted area and had caught eight suckers, two walleye and one northern pike. The Bay was very close to the residence of the accused on the Canoe Lake First Nation and was his preferred area to fish. The remainder of Canoe Lake was subject to restrictions governing all fishing but open to unlimited Treaty sustenance fishing all year round. The accused admitted to the actus reus of the offence. Under the Constitutional Questions Act, 2012 the accused gave notice that he would argue that s. 7(2)(b) of the regulations was invalid because it restricted his Treaty and Aboriginal right to fish food in the restricted area as defined by the Regulations; infringed his Treaty and Aboriginal right to fish for food as protected by s. 35(1) of the Constitution Act, 1982; and infringed his Treaty and Aboriginal right to fish for food as protected by s. 25 of the Charter of Rights. The agreed Statement of Facts confirmed the accused’s Aboriginal Treaty status and right to sustenance fishing. The Crown’s major witness was an expert in fish biology and he testified that the restricted area had been closed to protect it for walleye spawning. He stated that the closed area could not be opened for sustenance fishing. The conservation effort had been supported by the Canoe Lake Band Council./n HELD: The accused was found guilty. The court found that the accused had failed to show a breach of his Treaty fishing right that would raise a defence or a Charter remedy to the charge against him: 1) the challenged regulations were within the implied common law limitations on Aboriginal fishing rights; 2) alternatively, the regulations fell within the provisions that permitted such regulations in Treaty 10; 3) alternatively, if they were not within the implied limitations of the right, the evidence had not established a prima facie infringement of the right; 4) alternatively, if there was a breach, it met the justification principles set out in Sparrow and Pierone.","The accused was charged with angling for or consuming fish in waters closed to commercial and recreational fishing contrary to s. 7(2)(b) of the Saskatchewan Fishery Regulations, 1995. The issue was whether the accused was bound by s.7(2) of s.8 of the Regulations, made pursuant to the Saskatchewan Fisheries Act, 1995 and whether his Treaty right to fish for sustenance/food was violated. HELD: The accused was granted a stay of the charge. The Court found that the evidence presented was that the accused admitted to the actus reus of the substantial charge but put forth as defence his Treaty rights to fish in any water and at any time he so chooses. The evidence also showed that the restriction on commercial fishing in the area was not an infringement on his Treaty Right to fish. The only infringement that the Saskatchewan government could be found to be reasonably justified was the reduction of the quota for commercial and outfitter recreational anglers to 5 percent. The accused’s evidence remained uncontradicted by any defence evidence."

She also sought a declaration that the Charter is infringed by the definition of spouse in s. 2(g) of the Act, because it does not include or recognize her common law relationship. The Chambers judge dismissed the application. He found that marital status is not an analogous ground upon which to base claim of discrimination under s. 15(1) of the Charter; or, in the alternative, that s. 2(g) does not constitute discrimination under s. 15(1) of the Charter; or, in the further alternative, that if s. 2(g) is discriminatory, it is saved by s. of the Charter. Allowing the appeal, that marital status is an analogous ground, and that s. 2(g) is discriminatory under s. 15 of the Charter because it denies a person in a common law relationship benefits which are granted to a similar person in a marriage relationship. The Crown did not discharge its onus of proving that the discrimination is demonstrably justified in a free and democratic society. The court rejected the appellant's submission that common law should be read in to the Act, and instead declared s. 2(g) to be unconstitutional and of no force and effect. This declaration was suspended for 12 months to enable the legislature to devise new criteria for eligibility under the Act that do not infringe s. 15(1) of the Charter.","The appellant and the respondent lived together for ten years.

The respondent sought a declaration under the MPA that she had no legal right to any share of it on a marriage breakdown. The applicant and respondent separated in 1995.

Art and Laura, the maternal grandparents oppose the application and want the boys returned to their care. The mother, Melody, supported her parent's application for custody. HELD: The boys are in need of protection and there is an order placing the boys in the permanent care of the Minister. As long as the boys are in foster care, the Ministry will make arrangements for the boys to have regular access to their mother and to Art and Laura.  1) There is no doubt but that Art and Laura love and wish the best for the boys. However, there are real concerns about Art and Laura' familial context. There is the fact that Art and Laura's own children were apprehended in 1989 and committed to the Minister. It is pertinent to note Art and Laura are estranged from four of their six children.  Two of Art's children claim he sexually assaulted them. When Melody testified she said her first preference was that the boys be placed with Mary Stevens, their foster parent, but did acknowledge that the boys would be in good hands with Art and Laura. 2) While the Court accepts that the Stevens home is a positive and nurturing one, there is no question it is not an ideal physical place for 9 people. With organization, routine and discipline however, it can function at a satisfactory level. Further, if an order is made under s. 37(2), the boys have the opportunity to be adopted. The Court cannot lightly preclude that possibility.","The Ministry sought an order under s. 37(2) which is a permanent committal and is a precursor to the boys being placed for adoption. The boys were apprehended from the care of their maternal grandparents, who were apprehended in 1989 and 1991. The parents opposed the application and petitioned the Court to return their three boys to their care. The parties, who had been residing in the same therapeutic foster home, were all of the sudden apprehended by the police. The police arrived at the home at the accused's residence and found the boys' remains in the parents' home. The children were residing with the parents, who resided in a therapeutic foster care home. At the onset of the trial, the mother of the boys, who was described as his step-daughter, indicated that she supported her parents' application for custody. The Court found the convictions were an injustice and ordered a permanent order placing the boys in the custody of the Minister until the age of 18."
c_2011skqb478.txt,"The accused was found guilty of possession of cocaine for the purpose of trafficking and possession of marijuana for the purpose of trafficking contrary to s. 5(3)(a) the Controlled Drugs and Substances Act, and having in his possession cash (almost $30,000) knowing it was obtained through the commission of an offence contrary to s. 354 and 355(a) of the Criminal Code. At issue was the accused's sentence. The Crown sought a global sentence of 5 years plus a forfeiture order of items seized, a fine in lieu of forfeiture for all cash used for legal fees, a mandatory weapons prohibition and sought bodily substances for DNA analysis. As the accused had been denied bail and had pre- trial detention of 15 months and 24 days, the defence sought one and one-half times credit for time served on remand.HELD: The accused had 9 prior drug convictions since 1999, two for trafficking in 2000 for which he received a 12 month sentence of incarceration and, in 2007, one trafficking and conspiracy to traffic which resulted in his receiving a 5 year penitentiary sentence. As the accused had been a compliant prisoner on remand, the Court granted him credit for 1.5 days for each day spent on remand for a total of 23 months and 21 days credit. The Court imposed a sentence of 30 months imprisonment, and ordered a DNA sample as well as a fine in lieu of forfeiture in the sum of $16,326 (being the sum transferred to the accused's legal counsel to pay his legal fees) to be paid within 60 days and, in default of payment, a term of imprisonment of 6 months consecutive to the term of imprisonment otherwise imposed.","The accused was found guilty of three counts contained in an amended Indictment dated December 12, 2011, charging him with the following offences: possession of a controlled substance for the purposes of trafficking contrary to s. 5(3)(a) of the Controlled Drugs and Substances Act; unlawfully possessing property (or proceeds of property), knowing that all (or part) of that property was obtained as a result of the commission in Canada of an offence punishable by indictment contrary to section 354 and 355(a)of the Criminal Code; possession of drugs for the purpose of trafficking; breach of probation; breach probation; failure to comply with terms and conditions of the probation and drug trafficking provisions; breach to probation; aggravating circumstances; the accused's pre-trial detention which included the fact that he was in possession of cocaine and marijuana at the time he was arrested, was in part the product of a failed preliminary hearing date; a minor accident saw the prosecutor unable to reach the accused; and the accused was convicted of possession of marijuana. The aggravating factors in this case were that the amount of cocaine found in the accused’s possession was admittedly for the use of trafficking and that he possessed a significant amount of cash. The accused had nine prior drug convictions since 1999, two for trafficking and one for conspiracy to traffic. He had nine previous drug convictions for the offences for the same offence. The amount of drugs found in his possession for the trafficking was not comparable to those cases that involved sophisticated drug distribution and trafficking organizations dealing with the huge quantities found in van loads or bricks of cocaine. Nevertheless, the quantity was found to be a sufficient quantity to warrant a reduction in his sentence for trafficking. The Court found that the accused had a serious prior conviction record for drug trafficking and conspiracy to do so as well as a number of drug possession charges. The offences were committed for the commission of trafficking for the benefit of trafficking."
3_2004skqb379.txt,"FIAT: The issues to be determined on this application are custody, child support and cancellation of the arrears of child support. HELD: 1) On the issue of custody, the mere passage of time, in this instance 9 years, would constitute a material change in circumstances relevant to custody. The child is now 15 years old. The parties are not candidates for joint custody and shared parenting. The child's view of the dysfunctional relationship between her parents compels this Court to preserve the status quo as being in the child's best interests. The petitioner will continue as the sole custodian.  2) The access was varied in January 2004. Nothing has changed to warrant a variation. 3) There was no evidence to support the respondent's statement that the child is living with him half the time. There was no evidence or explanation as to why he has failed to pay child support, which creates the present arrears. The evidence with respect to the respondent's finances was unsworn and out of date. In oral argument, the respondent asserted that he contributed to his daughter's care and that he is contributing to her education trust fund. If these expenditures were in fact made over and above his own cost of living, the Court would be compelled to accept the fact that he has financial resources available to him other that the $9,940 of social assistance which is disclosed in his tax return and financial statement. 4) The essence of the respondent's application for variation of the child support is based on his claim that his health has precluded him from working. The respondent's doctor was examined and, based on that medical evidence, the Court could not conclude that the respondent's generalized anxiety and depression disorder is beyond his control. The evidence was that the respondent could choose to help himself by eliminating alcohol and marijuana use. The respondent failed to meet the burden of proof by demonstrating that his depression and anxiety disorder was the consequence of factors beyond his control and thus preventing him from working and having an income with which to pay his child support obligations during the period under review. The application for variation of child support and cancellation of child support arrears is dismissed with costs.","FIAT. The respondent applied to vary the support and access provisions of the May 2, 1995 judgment. The 1995 judgment provided for the divorce of the petitioner and distribution of matrimonial property estate to the couple as well as custody, access and support for the child of the marriage. At the time of the application the petitioner was 13 years old and the respondent was in the primary care of her mother. The petitioner was 15 years old. At that time the respondent's income was $50,000 per year. The Voices Report indicated that the respondent had been unemployed for all of the past 15 years. The appellant claimed that he was on disability and that his income from social assistance was $9,383.56. The Respondent applied to have the support order varied and to have his child support reduced from $250 to $250. The Court dismissed the appellant's application to vary child support and arrears. The material change in circumstances did not warrant a variation. The appellants were not candidates for joint custody and shared parenting. The fact that the appellant was 15 and presumably all the wiser than she was two years ago indicates that the Court had not reached a threshold at which it would have decided to vary."

The Crown applies to admit into evidence oral statements made by the complainant to her neighbor and to the police for consideration of the truth of their contents. HELD: The statements made by the complainant are found to be reliable and are therefore admissible.  1) Hearsay statement may be admitted on a principled basis, the governing principles are reliability and necessity. A number of cases have held that necessity is met when a witness recants or in some other fashion effectively holds hostage evidence that cannot be obtained from another source. 2) There is no other way to obtain the complainant's evidence.

Where the hearsay statement was made in circumstances which provide some guarantees of trustworthiness, the test for reliability will be met. The following circumstances are evidence of trustworthiness: the complainant arrived unexpectedly at her neighbor's apartment, she was upset and crying, she asked that police be called, she spontaneously described the assault, she repeated a consistent version to the police, she had fresh red marks which corresponded with her description of the assault and the accused verified aspects of her complaint with comments he made.","The accused was charged with assault contrary to s. 266.

Evidence would be admitted on voil dire. 1) The complainant's evidence was important to the Crown's case and there was no other means of obtaining that evidence. Whether her alcohol consumption that night erased her recollection of events or whether she was a hostile witness was immaterial. 2) The accused's evidence is important to both the Crowns case and the court's. There is no other way of obtaining the evidence.  3) HELD': The test of reliability was met when the complainant recanted on an earlier statement. The statement was admissible for consideration in all circumstances. The test for reliability was found to be met when a witness recanted. The accused was found guilty of common-law spouse's allegation that he had hit her. The court found that the test of necessity was met.  4) The Crown came to rely on the indicia that were found in the complainant's statement. Whether she was intoxicated or not, she effectively held hostage that evidence and the Court need not determine the reason for the purpose of this application.  5) The Court found that there were sufficient indicias of reliability to substitute for the lack of oath, lack of cross-examination and absence of video taping.  6) The evidence was found reliable and admissible. The Court's inference that the accused came to the conclusion that she was too intoxicated to provide credible statement was not supported by the evidence as a whole. The evidence of the complainant was important because it was important and there is no alternative means of getting that evidence (other than to call the police)."

The journalists had no prior opportunity to hear its contents because Jones entered a guilty plea. The application was not opposed. The applicant sought an order for mandamus or a declaration. HELD: The presumption is in favour of public access to court records and the burden to contrary proof lies with the person who would deny access. This right is tempered by other factors (see R. v. SJS). Requiring the journalists to attend at the offices of the Attorney General and playing the CD ROM and making their own notes balances the interests of innocent parties whose conversations were recorded.","The Saskatoon Star-Post applied for access to a CD-ROM entered in evidence at a sentencing hearing.

The AG did not oppose the application and the applicant was ordered to return to its usual business activities.HELD: The applicant sought an order for mandamus, or a declaration. The Court of Queen's Bench is the appropriate Court to obtain such relief. The presumption in favour of public access to court records and the burden to the contrary proof lies upon the person who would deny the exercise of the right. This right was tempered somewhat by other factors. The Attorney General did not opposed the application but merely sought a court order to release the CD to the applicant. The applicant was to make a copy of the CD for its expense.  1)The applicant had no prior opportunity to hear portions of the conversation on theCD-ROM because the accused entered guilty plea. The CD-Rambler was in its own premises and own leisure and was not played for the sentencing judge. 2)The accused's journalists had no access to hear all of the testimony on the CDs-ROM, because the applicant entered a plea to guilty to a common assault charge.

b_2017skqb308.txt,"The Minister of Social Services applied for an order committing a two-year-old child to the care of his maternal grandparents for an indefinite period of time. The grandparents were previously designated as persons of sufficient interest. The child had lived with them since birth. The mother and father both suffered from addictions and had stopped living together by the time the child was born. The father had multiple criminal convictions, including drinking and driving offences and weapons offences. The mother’s relationship with her parents, family support worker and child protection worker during the course of the child’s life had been marked by volatility, argumentative behaviour and threats, one of which resulted in criminal harassment charges. The child was the subject of a protection order, which imposed conditions upon his parents. Neither meaningfully complied with the conditions set out in the protection order. Both parents testified at trial that their present circumstances were not suitable to raise a child. Each expressed intention to take steps necessary to provide a home for the child. Each parent asserted that a temporary order was appropriate. | HELD: The child was placed in the custody of his grandparents on an indefinite basis, which, while not temporary, was not as potentially immutable as a permanent order. That the child was in need of protection was not seriously challenged by either his mother or father. The prospect for change at the time of trial was limited to statements of good intentions. On their own, such statements were insufficient. There were opportunities for the parents to demonstrate a reasonable prospect for change. These opportunities were squandered and, in some cases abusively rejected by the mother.",HELD: The Court found that the parties were persons of sufficient interest regarding the child pursuant to s. 23(1)(a) of The Child and Family Services Act and that an indefinite order of protection was appropriate. The Ministry’s position was that both parties were able and willing to provide the minimum level of parenting required for the child’lls needs. The Court also found that neither parent had demonstrated the kind of permanency that would justify any form of reunification now or in the foreseeable future. The issue was whether the children were receiving the level of parental care that was below the minimal standard that will be tolerated in our society. The respondent’d parents were in the position to allow the child to be placed with them.

HELD: The Court granted judgment for damages in the amount of $3,822 for necessary repairs and $100 for cleaning expenses and granted the counter-claim in the amount of $580 for unpaid work performed by the defendant and then applied setoff. The Court allowed the cost of issuing the claim and for reasonable cost of service.","The plaintiffs claim damages for $5,975.95 for the removal of a bedroom wall. The plaintiffs claim they owe the defendant for the cost of the removal. The defendant denies his workmanship was poor, that he was not allowed to finish the job or clean up. The plaintiff counterclaims for lost use of tools in the amount of $6,292.54. HELD: 1) The plaintiffs were awarded judgment against the defendant in the amounts of $3,822.00 for the necessary repairs and $100 for cleaning. The counterclaim is set off against the claim of the plaintiffs. 2) The defendant was found to be the primary contractor for the plaintiffs' renovation work. The damage was caused by the defendant's use of expensive, but not exclusive, tools. The court declined to allow the plaintiffs to recover the full amount of their claim for unpaid work. 3) The plaintiff was awarded judgment for $3.342.54 for the lost use tools.  4) The defendants were found entitled to judgment against each of the plaintiff's employees in the sum of $5.6 million. The claim for punitive damages was reduced to $3278.54 as the defendant was awarded $580.00. 5) The claim was awarded for lost wages and lost time. The defendants are entitled to judgments against each plaintiff for $1,000.00 in the total amount of approximately $3 million. 6) The court found that the defendant’s conduct constituted a breach of the contract and negligence, there was nothing malicious, oppressive or high-handed, such that punitive damages are rationally required to punish or deter. The objective of punitive damages is to punish rather than compensate. They are confined to exceptional cases where the defendant committed a breach. The Court found that while the defendant had breached his contract and is entitled to compensation for the damage done to the plaintiffs’ home, the damage was not sufficient to justify an award for damages of $1 million. 7) The Court declined to award punitive damages in this case."

The accused applied for an order pursuant to s.581(1) of the Criminal Code quashing count 1 on the grounds it offended the 'single transaction rule'; an order pursuant to ss.7 and 24(1) of the Charter and the common law doctrine of abuse of process that portions of the indictment as amended be quashed or stayed on the basis of the judgment in the trial of the former co-accused, Reginald Schafer; alternatively, an order staying the proceedings on the grounds of unreasonable delay in bringing the accused to trial. He argued the Crown would be in breach of an agreement in which he waived delay to proceed on the charges on which inconsistent findings could be made and would constitute bad faith. HELD: 1)The application to quash count 1 on the basis it charges more than one transaction was dismissed. The count particularizes in the alternative various ways in which the accused is alleged to have defrauded the investors of ICC by using funds of ICC to advance his or Schafer's interests. The case law cited by both parties clearly establishes that the word 'transaction' as used in s.581(1) is to be interpreted broadly and flexibly, and that a single transaction may, in this sense, include a number of acts or incidents occurring over a period of time. 2)Count 1 of the indictment was to be amended. The application to stay proceedings on the basis of findings made in the Schafer trial was allowed in relation to the particular charge in subpara.(b) of count 1 regarding use of ICC funds in the amount of $513,000 for Trirak along with subpara.(j) regarding alleged representations to ICC's investors that 30% of their investment would be invested in GICs. To allow the Crown to pursue these allegations would be an abuse of process. The Crown had indicated it would not proceed with subparagraphs (c) or (d). 2)There had not been unreasonable delay in light of the complexity of the charges, reasons for the delay, and the agreement by the applicant not to object to certain portions of delay. There was ongoing disclosure and there were various court appearances following the laying of charges.","FIAT: The accused applies for an order pursuant to s. 581(1) of the Criminal Code quashing a count of the indictment as amended on the ground that it applies to more than one single transaction; alternatively, an order staying the proceedings on the grounds of unreasonable delay. The Crown alleges that the accused and co-accused, who was convicted of the same charge, did by deceit or fraud, or, in the sense of which it did, defraud, or both, by using the funds of International Capital Corporation (ICC) to advance their personal business interests over those of ICC (the Crown alleges the accused was the sole director and shareholder and the investors were simply not defrauded in relation to those matters). The accused argues that certain of the express findings of the trial judge in the case raise issues of res judicata or issue estoppel in relation the matters now alleged against the accused. HELD: The application to quash the count is dismissed. 1) The Court has power under s.590 to order that a single count be divided where it is satisfied the ends of justice require it.  2) In relation to some of the matters which may appear to make findings favourable to the accused, the Court is not bound by the conclusions of the judge in Schafer. The Court will consider an application to order the indictment separated pursuant to ss.589 (the same purpose) if the accused could show that it would be prejudicial to put the complex indictment to a jury. 3) The Crown has power to order a single charge be divided (i.e. to remain within the definition of 'transaction' which is defined in s.515(1)(a) of The Criminal Code) where the express decision of the Court in that case raised issues of presumption of innocence or estoppela. The essence of the argument is that the Crown was not bound in the present proceeding by the findings of Klebuc J. but preferred to await the judgment of the Crown in light of the other case that it was facing."

The court believed the evidence provided by the two accused and found that it was possible that the lease represented the actual arrangement between them and O.G. and that they believed that there only 400 plants in the greenhouses and they were part of a legal grow operation. The letter provided by O.G. purporting to change the address of his licences was found to have been forged by him. Regarding the possession for the purpose of trafficking, the court found that it was not satisfied on the evidence that either of the accused ever had personal possession or control of the marijuana plants nor that they had joint or constructive possession by virtue of some arrangement with O.G. The accused had explained that the cash seized by the police from their house had been received by them after they sold a trailer.","Criminal Law – Cannabis Business – Economic CrimeHELD: The Court of Appeal held that an amendment to an information expanding the time particulars of the offence can be made at trial based upon evidence that indicates the offence may have been committed within the amended timeframe. The Court held that the evidence pointing to the possibility that the Crown has proven beyond a reasonable doubt that the accused were unlawfully producing cannabis, that the marijuana was being grown for the purposes of trafficking, and that the currency in question was not obtained by the commission in Canada of an offence punishable by indictment. The evidence did not provide precise information as to when construction of the greenhouses started, although common sense would suggest it would have started within the first week of June, but the evidence indicated that the first few months of 2016 were the start of the marijuana crop crop season. The accused's residence was located to the east of the greenhouse site and was clearly a marijuana grow operation. The court found that the cannabis crop was healthy and some 449 plants were being grown at the site. The Crown challenged the veracity of the accused's evidence. The defence argued that the three individuals were active participants in the marijuana grow operations and were in the possession for the purpose of trafficking. The offence was committed against the accused, and the evidence did show that the Court had not established that the alleged offences were committed against them. The defendant's residence had been extensively searched and the court found evidence that the four individuals were involved in the cultivation of marijuana plants. The alleged cultivation of cannabis by the accused was a relatively sophisticated marihuana grow operation, with the plants being grown under valid licences, being grown in the presence of other individuals, and being in the possiblilty of trafficking in marijuana. The marijuana crop was legal tender for production on the accused’s property and the licence to grow marijuana was valid. The applicant’ s residence was found to be in the area of the alleged marijuana crop cultivation and was in good condition. The RCMP found electronic devices and documents related to their previous work in the oilfield. The property was also found to have a computer lab and a computer system for monitoring the environment. The affidavit also showed that the affidavit material contained information that indicated the marijuana plants were not being grown by the applicant for the offence of trafficking and that they were not producing marijuana for the production of marijuana. Since the affidavit was not provided to the court, the court did not find any evidence that this information was relevant to the application of the affidavit. The application of s. 7 of the Criminal"

She contends that the chambers judge erred in varying the order for maintenance and reducing the amount of arrears in the absence of evidence that there was a change in the conditions, means and needs of the respondent or the children as contemplated by s. 17(4) of the Divorce Act.[FOOTNOTE 1][2] The respondent contends that the amount of child support should be reduced by reason of his reduced income caused by his unemployment or reduced employment over the last four years. The appellant argues that the respondent has failed to satisfactorily explain his unemployment. There is evidence that his change in income is due to his own voluntary action and, as a result, he has failed to establish the threshold 'change in circumstances' which could result in a variation of the order. [3] The appeal is allowed and the decision of the chambers judge is set aside. There is evidence from which this Court can impute income to the respondent in the amount of $27,000, and the child support shall be varied to $510.00 per month as of February 1, 2004 in accordance with the Child Support Guidelines. The sum of $1,926.78 currently held by the Maintenance Enforcement Office shall be applied to the arrears.

A sentencing hearing was held because there was significant disagreement on the facts. The Crown alleged three aggravating factors: 1) that the sexual assaults were numerous, 2) that the accused touched the victims directly on their skin and not just on their clothing and 3) that there was digital penetration by the accused on both victims. HELD: At a sentencing hearing, the Crown must prove aggravating factors beyond a reasonable doubt. The Court held that the two victims were sexually assaulted by the accused on numerous occasions over a period of a number of years. The Court was satisfied these sexual assaults were a common occurrence on every occasion that the accused was in the company of his granddaughters. The Court found that the accused touched the victims under their clothing on numerous occasions and that there were a couple of occasions that the accused digitally penetrated each victim. Finally, the Court concluded that the accused got bolder over time and took more liberties and chances with his victims.",The accused entered guilty pleas to three charges. The accused admitted to touching the victims under their clothing and then touching them over the top of their clothes. The evidence established that the abuse occurred over several years. The Court asked the Court to find that the accused touched the victims directly on their skin and not just over their clothing. The defence argued that this was repeated sexual abuse which occurred over a number of years. HELD: The Court was satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt that both victims were sexually assaulted by the accused. The Crown must prove that the sexual assaults were numerous. The facts concerning the frequency of the assaults were beyond reasonable doubt. The alleged digital penetration was common. The offences were committed on every occasion the accused was in the company of the girls. The court found that the alleged digital penetrations were numerous and that the effects of the sexual assault on the victims were severe. The sexual assaults occurred on every occasions the accused were in the presence of the young girls.
1991canlii4370.txt,"The defendant lawyer was retained for the purpose of obtaining and disbursing mortgage funds. The plaintiffs, creditors of the defendant's client, sued the defendant for negligent misrepresentation, breach of trust and breach of undertaking. The defendant initially received three irrevocable letters of direction for payment of amounts owing on a construction project. When the project got into financial difficulty the defendant advised his client to seek separate counsel to deal with the creditors - suppliers. At a creditors meeting the defendant advised the creditors' counsel of the initial three letters of direction. The project was considered viable by the creditors and continued, with the defendant obtaining postponements of the three letters of direction. Further creditors' meetings were held, a Creditors' Committee struck, and subsequent letters of direction sent to the defendant by the client and certain creditors. The defendant, in acknowledging a subsequent letter of direction, made no mention of the earlier three letters, nor any explanation of 'all of the proceeds'. One member of the Committee was aware of the initial irrevocable letters of direction. On what was to be the final mortgage draw, the defendant requested and was refused a postponement of the initial three letters. With his client's consent, the defendant disbursed the funds, to pay off the initial three creditors, a mechanics' lien referred in one of the subsequent letters of direction, his legal fees and the balance as per a letter of direction received from two of three members of the Creditors' Committee. Dismissing the action, that (1) there was no negligent misrepresentation as the creditors had continued to advance supplies, not on the basis of the defendant's letter of acknowledgement, but because they considered the project viable. Further, certain other plaintiffs were not aware of the letter, and could not have relied on it. Other plaintiffs did not supply after the letter and therefore did not rely on it. The Court noted that on a balance of probabilities, the defendant's disbursement did not cause the demise of the project. At the time of the disbursement the project was still viable and the plaintiffs made their own decision to cease supplying and to lien the project;  (2) there was no breach of trust as the defendant had no fiduciary duty and had at no time acted for the plaintiffs;  and  (3) there was no breach of undertaking as the undertaking must be considered in all the circumstances, including knowledge of the plaintiffs, the other letters and meetings. The Court concluded that the member of the Creditors' Committee who was aware of the initial irrevocable letters had a duty to advise the other members. The documentation was clear that legal fees would be deducted and the Committee was also aware of the direction to pay the mechanics' lien.","The first mortgagee to the project, the second mortgagee, had received a number of irrevocable letters of direction which he acknowledged required him to pay the mortgage brokerage and architectural fees from the two mortgagee companies. The project was financially tight from the very beginning. Some of the suppliers and creditors had become concerned that the first building had an overrun and the project at this time had a cash flow problem. The second mortgageee, the first mortgageee had indicated willingness to inject more money into the project but had now indicated that the project was not viable. The first mortgageees, who were suppliers and customers of the project and relied upon the services of the two second mortgagees, had become dissatisfied with the handling of the first and the subsequent mortgage draws by the second mortgages. The loans were due within four months. The third mortgagee was requested to pay off all of the mortgage advances on the first draw but had been delayed by three months. In the third mortgageee's letter, which was also acknowledged by him, the plaintiff disbursed the remaining funds contrary to the first two letters. The plaintiff sued the second and third mortgageees claiming negligent misrepresentation and breach of trust. The defendants argued that the plaintiff was never in a fiduciary relationship with the plaintiffs nor was he retained by them or purport to act for them or on their behalf. HELD: The second plaintiff's claim was dismissed. 1)The plaintiff had not established a breach of a fiduity or trust and could not succeed on this ground. 2)The third plaintiff's claims were not dismissed. 3)The plaintiffs had not proven a breach under breach of the trust."

A one-year concurrent sentence was imposed for the conviction of prohibited possession of a firearm. The court gave him credit at the rate of 1:1.5 for his time on remand, resulting in a net global sentence of six years, five months to be served in a federal penitentiary. The Gladue report was considered and the background of the accused was assessed as an enormous mitigating factor. The court found that this was not an appropriate case to make an order pursuant to s. 743.6 of the Code both because of the multiple Gladue factors and because it had addressed the principles of denunciation and deterrence in the global sentence.","The Court sentenced the accused pursuant to s. 236(a) of the Criminal Code, RSC 1985, C-46 and his guilty plea to possession of a firearm while prohibited from doing so. The accused had been previously convicted of second degree murder, but his conviction was changed to manslaughter, which was punishable by a term of four years imprisonment or more. The Crown requested a detailed Gladue Report be prepared by the Crown and provided with the court's assistance. The report was extensively researched and the Court was able to conclude that the factors considered in the Gladue report were the factors that led the Court to conclude a global sentence of 10 years was appropriate. The Court reviewed all of the cases provided to it by counsel and found that a global total of 11 years was necessary to be served in a federal penitentiary on the manslaughter conviction. The sentencing principles outlined in s. 743.6 of the Code were reviewed and the appropriate sentence for the offence of manslaughter was set at 12 years. The court found that the accused had a lengthy record as a result of his numerous prior convictions and that the Gladues factors were not considered in support of a 15 year sentence."

b_2000skqb36.txt,"The accused, Cote, applied for remedy pursuant to s.24 of the Charter of Rights stating that he was denied the right to be tried on a fraud charge within a reasonable time. Twenty-two months passed between the laying of the charge and the trial date. Cote was not responsible for the delay and actively pursued a speedy trial. The delay was caused by the Crown's failure to provide timely disclosure. HELD: The charge was stayed. In applying the decision of the SCC in R. v. Morin, the court found that 22 months is an unreasonable and exceptional period of delay and is of sufficient length to warrant an inquiry. This case had no particular complexity above the norm for cases of this kind and did not require this delay. Cote did not directly or indirectly waive his s.11(b) right to be tried within a reasonable time. Cote was subject to substantial and sufficient prejudice by the delay. He suffered damage to his political career, embarrassment from media reports, unemployment, and economic hardship. The court balanced the individual's right to be tried within a reasonable time with society's interest in having the matter proceed to trial despite delay. Here the defence was not seeking to delay the trial and use the protective shield of s.11(b)as an offensive weapon.","The accused was committed to stand trial on one of the fraud charges and shortly after the swearing in of the new Chief, the Crown made another demand for disclosure. The accused sought further disclosure.HELD: The application was based primarily on the accused's position that he has been denied the right to be tried on the fraud charge within a reasonable time. The Court found that just over 22 months had passed since the laying of the fraudulent charge and the scheduled trial date of February 28, 2000. The Crown acknowledged that the delay had been substantial and sufficient to tilt the balance in favour of requiring a judicial stay. The facts establish that the accused was not only delayed but also suffered prejudice. As the accused had not made any proper disclosure, the delay was substantial and necessary to enable him to participate in the new election. The delay in obtaining complete disclosure was sufficient to enable the defence to bring this application before the Court."

Romania sought extradition of the applicant so that he might serve a 3 year prison sentence imposed as a result of a conviction in Romania for criminally negligent homicide with respect to a motor vehicle collision where the accused, while impaired, hit a pedestrian and killed him. The applicant offered surety from the Romania community in Saskatchewan who did not appear to have known the accused for long and offered to put up his car as bond. The applicant had common law spouse in Saskatchewan but owned no real property. HELD: Although the Crown conceded that the applicant had met the relatively low threshold of showing that his application for leave to appeal his extradition order was not frivolous, the Court of Appeal declined to release the applicant. The Court of Appeal held that there is an elevated risk of flight in light of the fact that the applicant has exhausted all appeals in Romania and is facing a 3 year prison sentence. Canada's international obligations in extradition proceedings require the Court to look more severely at the risk of non-appearance than it would if the application was made solely under s. 679 in respect of criminal proceeding in Canada. The sureties offered by the applicant were not sufficient to ensure his attendance at Court. The application for judicial interim release was dismissed.","The accused applies for judicial interim release pursuant to s. 20(b) of the Extradition Act and s. 679 of the Criminal Code.

He is a Convention refugee and has resided in the United States since his birth. Romania opposes his extradition from Canada. The Court of Appeal in Regina quashed the committal order and the accused's application for interim judicial release. The application for judicial inter alia release was dismissed. The court found that the accused had met the low threshold of a flight risk posed by his non-appearance and that his application for bail was not frivolous. The fact that the respondent had no real property and Romania viewed the potential forfeiture of his vehicle as being of little assurance that he would surrender himself into custody given the risk posed."

The Husband claimed that the value of the crop harvested was less than the farm expenses and resisted any change in the previous interim orders made. HELD: Application dismissed. The Court was not prepared to make the interim orders requested on the basis of the contradictory affidavits filed. A pre-trial was directed.","The applicant sought an interim distribution of matrimonial property and interim support for her two children and an order prohibiting the respondent from contacting her and from going to her workplace.

d_1999skqb276.txt,"FIAT. The plaintiff applied for summary judgment in his claim for dismissal without just cause. The plaintiff was initially hired as body shop foreman but additionally acquired the title of assistant manager. When the body shop manager became ill that work load also fell to the plaintiff. It was during this period that the performance of the plaintiff, described by the defendant as serious misconduct, resulted in his termination. There was no issue of a lack of mitigation as the plaintiff accepted a job with another autobody shop but at a much lower rate of pay. The action was brought pursuant to the simplified procedure outlined in Part 40 of the Rules of Court. HELD: Damages were to be calculated by the parties for the 7 month notice period based on his income and value of benefits over the previous year, less the 6 weeks pay received, and less wages and benefits received from his new employment. Jurisdiction was reserved to hear further evidence should the parties not reach agreement. 1)By using the words 'shall grant judgment unless', Rule 488 requires the presiding judge to grant judgment except in the circumstances outlined in s.488(a)and(b). The test is not whether there is contradictory evidence in the affidavits but whether despite the contradictory evidence the issue(s) can be decided in the absence of cross-examination and it would be otherwise unjust to do so. If the court can assume the defendant's evidence is true and still grant summary judgment there is no genuine need for a trial. 2)As noted in numerous decisions, whether an employer is justified in summarily dismissing an employee is ultimately a question of fact. The plaintiff was not terminated because of poor job performance in performing his contractual duties as foreman and manager but because of his alleged poor performance in doing the job normally assigned to two persons. The employer has the right to expect that employees will not disparage their immediate supervisors or other employees in the course of their employment and certainly not to clients or customers of the employer. The type of conduct here would not justify dismissal the first time it came to the employer's attention if the employee had been guilty of such conduct while performing only his own job function. 'Griping' is not uncommon in the workplace. The case law seems uniform that one or more warnings to an employee must be given before it can be said such activity 'fractures the employment relationship'. The category of misconduct can be said to change from poor attitude to disobedience or insubordination where dismissal results after one or more warnings. 3)The plaintiff was entitled to 7 months notice to reflect the fact that junior management positions are fewer in number and the considerable wage difference between management and non- management positions.  4)The plaintiff was entitled to taxable costs.","FIAT. The plaintiff applied for summary judgment in his claim for dismissal without just cause brought pursuant to the simplified procedure outlined in Part Forty of the Rules of Court. The defendant opposed the application and requested a summary trial. The Plaintiff opposed the Application and sought damages. Rule 488 sets out the test for summary judgement. The test is not whether there is contradictory evidence in the affidavit material filed but rather, whether despite the contradictory evidence, the issue(s) can be decided in the absence of cross-examination and it would not otherwise be unjust to do so. The Court found that the Plaintiff applied to numerous autobody businesses prior to accepting the employment he did and was not successful in obtaining an equivalent position at an equivalent salary. Taking all factors into account, the Plaintiff's damages are to be calculated in the manner set out in the Rules."

A pedestrian was crossing a road adjacent to a parking lot and, while walking directly in front of a stopped vehicle, was struck by the vehicle when it rolled forward. HELD: The accused is not guilty. The court accepted the accused's evidence that his vehicle rolled forward only a short distance of not more than one foot and not at a fast or accelerated speed and that the pedestrian was crossing outside of the cross walk and that the accused applied his brakes as soon as he saw the pedestrian. The accused did exercise due diligence.","The accused was charged with driving without due care and attention contrary to s. 44(1) of the Highway Traffic Act. The accused was on duty in a marked police car when the vehicle struck the complainant. The complainant was crossing the street when the accused's vehicle rolled forward and collided with the complainant's vehicle. The issue to be determined was whether the Crown has proved that the accused drove without due notice and attention applying an objective test in assessing carelessness and whether the accused has then shown, on balance of probabilities, that he exercised due diligence in the context of the circumstances he encountered. HELD: The accused's action was found to be careless driving. The officer who was driving the vehicle was first asked if he could assist the complainant and then later advised him that he would sue the man who had just come out of Super Store. The vehicle rolled to a stop directly in front of the complainant, and the complainant crossed the street on foot directly in the defendant's vehicle, causing him to roll forward and strike the complainant in the hip. The defendant was found not guilty of the charge. 1) The officer's evidence that he did not touch the accelerator, and briefly took his foot off the brake, and then immediately reapplied the brake after seeing the complainant cross the street was accepted. The Crown suggested that the defendant had an oblique motive for thinking that the vehicle could slow down. The defence suggested that it was a Ford F150 with a speed limit of 25 km/h. 2) The actions of the accused were careless. The police officer who had to assist the plaintiff in the cross-walk were found to have been negligent. The Court was satisfied that the officer's actions in operating his vehicle on the road beside the complainant were careless and that his driving forward into the complainant was careless. 3) The accused did not appear to have thought that the motor vehicle he was driving was going to be too fast or too slow. The collision occurred at a cross- walk and the defendant crossed the road directly infront of the police vehicle. Given the nature of the incident and as an accident, the defendant was not only in the position to assist but also to assist and to have other police attend at the scene. The Accused's actions at the cross walk were careless as he was attempting to assist another officer in the task of identifying a person who had been so close to the complainant that he had to leave on his own.

b_1996canlii5028.txt,"Guardian was the general liability insurer for Kellogg. Royal was the primary insurer as holder of Kellogg's blanket fleet coverage. Kellogg's employee was involved in a motor vehicle accident while on company business but was driving his wife's vehicle at the time of the accident. Royal denied coverage and refused to defend on the basis of an exclusionary provision regarding the use of substitute automobiles. It was held at trial that Royal was not obligated to participate. HELD: 1)The case law reveals some inconsistencies with respect to the relationship between the duty to defend and the coverage provided by the policy. Where the policy clearly does not provide coverage, the insurer had no duty to defend. Where a policy only provides coverage for some allegations the insurer is only obligated to defend those allegations which may trigger the obligation to indemnify. When a policy is ambiguous some courts have adopted Thames and have stated the mere possibility that the policy may provide coverage is sufficient to oblige the insurer to defend. 2)Section 209 provides no guidelines as to the scope of the inquiry the judge may engage in. The chamber judge did not define the scope of his inquiry and stated that the standard suggestion that Guardian must raise an arguable point was 'off target'. To determine whether an insurer has the obligation to defend a chamber judge must examine the coverage provided by the policy. The judge made no finding of ambiguity in the exclusionary provision. He simply determined the Honda was not covered by the Royal policy and did not decide the issue of indemnity. 3)The affidavit evidence indicated that the parties lived in the same premises thus that argument was without merit. CONCURRING JUDGMENT: The appeal was dismissed for different reasons.  1)There has been an acceptance of the general concept that the duty to defend is broader than the duty to indemnify. To order an insurer to defend a chamber judge need be less sure the policy provides coverage than would be the case for an actual determination of liability under the policy. 2)There was a factual element which could not be determined on this application such as whether a partially deflated tire constitutes a breakdown within the meaning of the policy and whether the automobile the employee was driving was owned by someone living in the same dwelling. 3)The question centered around the words used in clause 5 of the policy and who it referred to. There were inconsistencies in terminology. The policy should not be interpreted as though the restriction it contains on what automobile can be used as a temporary substitute should be ignored.","An appeal from an application for directions to determine whether Royal had an obligation to defend after a motor vehicle accident occurred. At the time of the accident, the plaintiff was on company business and was driving his wife's Honda because his company car had a deflated tire. At issue was whether the chambers judge erred in his determination of which insurer was obligated to defend and whether the trial judge erpped in his application of the principles of contract interpretation. HELD: Appeal dismissed. 1)No matter the scope of the inquiry the duty to defend arises only when the pleadings disclose a claim which, if proven at trial, would be covered by provisions in the insurance policy. 2)The chambers judge did not have the factual basis before him to support his interpretation of the policy and form his conclusions. 3)The duty to protect arises only from the pleadINGS disclose a claims which, If proven at Trial, would provide coverage for that which is alleged in the claim. 4)The difficulty with a chambers judge engaging in an extensive inquiry into policy coverage in an application to determine if Royal has an obligationto defend arises when he ultimately rules there is no obligation to defending the action because the Honda involved is not insured by Royal. 5)The Chamber judge erroded the judicial function established by s. 209(3) of the Act by deciding the issue of indemnity when s.209(3)(a) makes it clear an application under s.207(1) does not affect the rights and obligations of the insurers in respect of the payment of any indemnity under their respective policies. 6)The Court of Appeal has not rendered its interpretation of that decision."
d_2007skqb324.txt,"This is an application by the accused for an order that evidence obtained by way of a telephone interception be ruled inadmissible because it is irrelevant. Alternatively, the accused seeks exclusion of the intercepted communication on the basis that it was conducted in violation of s. 8 of the Charter and ought to be excluded under s. 24(2). The accused is charged with abuse of a position of trust contrary to s. 153(1)(a) of the Code. HELD: The evidence is admissible. The accused's application is dismissed. 1) After examining the transcript of the conversation, it is immediately evident that the contents of the communication are relevant. The complainant and the accused are discussing the intimate details of their relationship. The conversation is logically probative to the charge. 2) The learned provincial court judge did in fact have sufficient evidence before him to issue the telephone intercept authorization. The complainant was prepared to initiate a telephone call to the accused and engage him in a conversation which would likely cause the accused to make admissions or statements which could be confirmatory of her allegations. 3) The authorization clearly permits the police to intercept private communications in relation to an offence under s. 271(1) of the Code. That investigation was live and bona fide at the time that the authorization was obtained. The law in this country is that evidence of other crimes revealed during the course of a lawful intercept process does not render the evidence obtained inadmissible in relation to an offence not named in the authorization. The focus is on whether the interception was lawfully obtained and executed, not on what is discovered. Here the police obtained a valid authorization to intercept private communications in relation to an offence under s. 271(1) of the Code. During the investigation of that charge, they obtained evidence which is relevant to an offence under s. 153(1)(a) of the Code. The fact that the offence of s. 153(1)(a) is not named in the authorization nor included as an offence for which an authorization to intercept private communications could be obtained, does not affect the admissibility of the evidence. Therefore, there is no Charter breach. 4) Even if the evidence was obtained in violation of s. 8 of the Charter, such evidence is considered non-conscriptive evidence. Where the evidence is non-conscriptive, the court ought to go on to do a balancing as to whether or not the evidence ought to be excluded pursuant to s. 24(2) of the Charter. The factors to be considered are trial fairness, seriousness of the breach and the effect of exclusion. In this case if there is a breach, it was not serious and was inadvertent, the result of unmindful draftsmanship. There is no evidence of bad faith. There is no evidence of manipulation. The seriousness of the breach, if there was one, was minimal, and to admit the evidence would not bring the administration of justice into disrepute.","The accused was charged with two counts of sexual assault contrary to s. 271(1) of the Charter and one count of conspiracy. The accused argued that the Provincial Court judge that authorized the interception had no basis to issue the telephone intercept authorization. HELD: The evidence was inadmissible because it was irrelevant. The learned judge did in fact have sufficient evidence before him to issue it. The evidence did not violate the accused's s. 8 Charter rights. Even if the evidence was obtained in violation of s.8 of the charter, the evidence is non-conscriptive. The Crown argued that there was no breach of s8 because the offence was not specified in the authorization. The defence argued that because the accused was denied his right to choose his audience and in the course of that lawful intercept process, obtained evidence relevant to another offence. The Court dismissed the accused application. It was not a Charter breach. The police intended to have the complainant initiate communication with the accused regarding their alleged sexual activity in anticipation of eliciting responses from the accused that would provide evidence concerning the alleged offences. The intercepted communication was non-consecutive evidence and was properly admitted by the trial judge."

e_1996canlii7080.txt,"FIAT. The Crown applied to have a witness, who was an unindicted co-conspirator and separately charged with drug offences arising out of the same investigation, declared adverse pursuant to s9 of the Canada Evidence Act. She had contradicted her prior video taped statement made shortly after her arrest and had demonstrated hostile attitude towards the Crown. The defence took the position that she was now telling the truth; that the statement was improperly obtained in breach of the confession rules of voluntariness and the statement did not meet the requirements set out in R. v. K.G.B. HELD: The witness' prior statement may be introduced in evidence for the substantive truth of its contents. It will be for the jury to decide what, if any, portions of such statement they wish to accept. 1)A prior inconsistent statement cannot be introduced in evidence for its substantive content, unless the requirement of necessity, and a threshold of reliability arrived at on a balance of probabilities are established. When, as here, a witness recants, the requirement of necessity is established. The real issue is whether the prior statement meets the test for reliability. When, as here, there is only one demonstrably false piece of testimony in the statement, which does not implicate anyone but rather attempts to exonerate someone, the Court was not prepared to say ipso facto the statement is unreliable. 2)The independent evidence sufficiently corroborated her statement in enough different particulars that, but for the demonstrably false portion, it met the threshold of reliability.","FIAT.
