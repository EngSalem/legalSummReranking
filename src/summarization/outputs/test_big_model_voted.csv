3_2004skqb374.txt,"FIAT: In 1996, the respondent was ordered to pay $600 per month as child support for his daughter. He now applies to reduce his support obligation and rescind the arrears which have accumulated. HELD: 1) In 1999, the respondent sold his ownership interest in a business and retained a one-third interest. In 2001, he was terminated from his full-time employment as a result of an unexplained absence from work after he received a suspension for insubordination. Since his termination, he has not obtained full-time employment. He has continued to work seasonally 3 months a year and earn the gross amount of $21,000. The Court found that it is the respondent's choice to work a minimum amount each year. It has been said that individuals, who are subject to support obligations, are entitled to make decisions in relation to their careers as long as the decisions are reasonable at the time having regard to the circumstances. The respondent's decision to work only three months a year and to possibly return to school is not reasonable. 2) For the purposes of this application, the respondent's income was imputed to be $40,000 and he was ordered to pay $328 per month as support for his daughter. 3) The sharing of the s. 7 special expenses should be based on the respondent's imputed income. 4) A retroactive variation of child support is warranted. The respondent commenced his application for variation in June 2002 and the chambers judge was of the view that any variation of support should be retroactive to September 2002.  In light of the fact the respondent's previous support obligation was tax deductible/tax inclusive, the petitioner may in fact benefit from a retroactive variation as the child support she will receive, pursuant to this order, will be payable on a net of tax basis.  5) Rule 608(2) provides that a successful party will be entitled to costs of a family law proceeding unless, pursuant to Rule 608(3), the successful party has behaved unreasonably or has acted in bad faith. The difficulty in the matter before me is determining whether or not the respondent has been successful. Although his support obligation decreases, his previous payment was tax deductible while his ongoing payment will be net of tax. It is very likely that the respondent's financial position has not changed as a result of the order. The Court also had grave concerns respecting the substantial delays in the proceedings caused by the respondent's unwillingness to provide financial disclosure. Costs were awarded to the petitioner in the sum of $750, as the discovery motion would not have been necessary had the respondent provided appropriate financial disclosure.","FIAT. The father was ordered to pay child support of $600 per month for the child. He applied to reduce his support obligation and rescind arrears which accumulated under the 1996 order. The primary questions to be answered were: 1) what is the father's current income; 2) is the mother underemployed; 3) if the child support is retroactive, should the application be granted to either the petitioner or the mother; 4) the history of this variation application and the factual context in which the questions will be determined. HELD: The father's decision to work a minimum amount each year and to only work three months of the year is not a reasonable decision when he has a continuing obligation to provide support for his child, Stephanie. It is very likely that his financial position has not changed as result of the order for child support. The difficulty in the matter is determining whether or not Mr. Pilat has, indeed, been successful on this motion. On all of the evidence, it appears that the father has chosen a lifestyle that imputed income to his dependents, is intentionally imputing income to them, and has made this decision to severely limit his earnings for a significant period of time. It appears that he has made a conscious decision to impute income to the dependents within the meaning of s. 19(1)(a) of the Federal Child Support Guidelines. The family has grave concerns respecting the substantial delays in this proceeding.","Mr. Pilat applies to reduce his support obligation and rescind arrears which have accumulated under Archambault J.’s order. [22] On all of the evidence I find it is Mr. Pilat\'s choice to work a minimum amount each year and, if he should return to school, it will be his choice to attend school and severely limit his earnings for a significant period of time. Mr. Pilat\'s decision to work only three months of the year and/or return to school is not a reasonable decision when he has a continuing obligation to provide support for his child, Stephanie. Mr. Pilat\'s income is, for the purpose of this application, imputed to be the sum of $40,000.00. Thus, any sharing of s. 7 special expenses should be based on Mr. Pilat\'s imputed income of $40,000.00 and Ms. Lilley\'s income of $39,000.00. [28] As regards Mr. Pilat\'s request for a retroactive variation, I have determined that the same is warranted.

The respondent's decision to work only three months a year and to possibly return to school is not reasonable. 2) For the purposes of this application, the respondent's income was imputed to be $40,000 and he was ordered to pay $328 per month as support for his daughter. 3) The sharing of the s. 7 special expenses should be based on the respondent's imputed income. 4) A retroactive variation of child support is warranted. The respondent commenced his application for variation in June 2002 and the chambers judge was of the view that any variation of support should be retroactive to September 2002.  In light of the fact the respondent's previous support obligation was tax deductible/tax inclusive, the petitioner may in fact benefit from a retroactive variation as the child support she will receive, pursuant to this order, will be payable on a net of tax basis.  5) Rule 608(2) provides that a successful party will be entitled to costs of a family law proceeding unless, pursuant to Rule 608(3), the successful party has behaved unreasonably or has acted in bad faith. The difficulty in the matter before me is determining whether or not the respondent has been successful. Although his support obligation decreases, his previous payment was tax deductible while his ongoing payment will be net of tax. It is very likely that the respondent's financial position has not changed as a result of the order. The Court also had grave concerns respecting the substantial delays in the proceedings caused by the respondent's unwillingness to provide financial disclosure. Costs were awarded to the petitioner in the sum of $750, as the discovery motion would not have been necessary had the respondent provided appropriate financial disclosure.","FIAT. The father was ordered to pay child support of $600 per month for the child. He applied to reduce his support obligation and rescind arrears which accumulated under the 1996 order. The primary questions to be answered were: what is the father's current income; is he underemployed; should the child support variation be retroactive; should costs of the application be granted to either Ms. Lilley or T.F. Huber. HELD: On all of the evidence, the father was undereployed. His choice to work a minimum amount each year and, if he should return to school, it will be his choice to attend school and severely limit his earnings for a significant period of time. It is clear that the decision to work only three months of the year and/or returned to school is not a reasonable decision when he has a continuing obligation to provide support for his child, Stephanie.  1) The father's financial position has not changed as a result of the order for child support. He has not provided appropriate financial disclosure.  2) The mother has requested costs as against the father for the additional legal expenses associated with having to submit motions to the Court in order to force the father to disclose financial information.  3) Costs awarded to the mother for the discovery motion which heard in this matter. The difficulty in the matter is determining whether or not the father has, indeed, been successful on this variation application.

He now applies to reduce his support obligation and rescind the arrears which have accumulated. HELD: 1) In 1999, the respondent sold his ownership interest in a business and retained a one-third interest. In 2001, he was terminated from his full-time employment as a result of an unexplained absence from work after he received a suspension for insubordination. Since his termination, he has not obtained full-time employment. He has continued to work seasonally 3 months a year and earn the gross amount of $21,000.

The primary questions to be answered were: 1) what is the father's current income; 2) is the mother underemployed; 3) if the child support is retroactive, should the application be granted to either the petitioner or the mother; 4) the history of this variation application and the factual context in which the questions will be determined. HELD: The application was adjourned sine die with direction to return the matter to court once the grievance filed by the father concerning his termination from Ipsco was determined by an arbitrator; and 5) the father intends to continue with his employment/ownership of Great Plains Outfitters and to only work three months of the year. Based on the applicant's gross annual income of $39,000 and the fact that the mother is heavily involved in the gym, it is clear that the decision to work a minimum amount each year and/or return to school is not a reasonable one when he has a continuing obligation to provide support for his child, Stephanie. It is very likely that the father has not changed as a result of the April 1996 order for child support.

[21] After carefully considering the testimony of the witnesses and the exhibits filed herein, the Court concludes that the plaintiff’s action cannot succeed for the following reasons: [22] The plaintiff’s claim is dismissed.",0.21798365122615806,0.4803493449781659,"The plaintiff brought an action for water damage sustained to her former residence when frozen pipes burst in the basement. Her contention is that she instructed the Town Office to shut off her water supply and the failure to do so led to the damages being sustained. The Town of Martensville disputes that such instructions were given and that, in any event, the cause of the pipes bursting was not a result of the water not being turned off, but rather because the plaintiff had the power and heat disconnected. HELD: The plaintiff's action was dismissed. There was no order as to costs. 1)The Court could not find clear instructions given by the plaintiff to the town to disconnect the water service. To the contrary, the form executed by her clearly indicates request for final billing. The evidence demonstrates a misunderstanding at best between what the plaintiff believed she was requesting and what in fact she did instruct. This cannot be construed as negligence in the circumstances by the town nor does the fact that specific forms are now utilized for disconnect purposes elevate the matter on the facts before the Court, to negligence by the Town. 2)The plaintiff was awarded costs of the action.",0.5125348189415042
6_2009skqb394.txt,"The plaintiff bought a house. She used the services of Cecilia Mui, a realtor associated with the defendant 100% Realty Associates Ltd. operating as Re/max Saskatoon. The house was purchased from the defendants Edward and Verl Karpinski. The vendors' realtor was the defendant, Mario Jacobucci, owner of the defendant Trevi Holdings Ltd. The house did not meet the plaintiff's expectations. She now sues the defendants seeking recovery of damages for alleged latent defects. She claims Ms. Mui fell below the standard of care required of a realtor representing a purchaser. She claims Ms. Mui was negligent in misrepresenting certain facts and breached the fiduciary duty expected of her. The plaintiff claims the Karpinskis misrepresented facts to her, negligently and fraudulently. The plaintiff claims that Mr. Jacobucci and his company are liable to her in damages, both in negligence and as parties to the misrepresentations made by the vendors. Special and general damages are claimed as are aggravated damages and punitive damages. The trial took place over 22 days, spanning several years and included testimony from 14 witnesses. Two main issues are raised. The first is the liability of each of the defendants. The second issue is quantum of damages. The credibility of the parties is at the forefront of the determination of the issues. HELD: The vendors are liable to the plaintiff for breach of contract. Each of the defendants is a tortfeasor, each having breached an obligation or duty owed to the plaintiff, whether through negligence or misrepresentation. Their wrongful acts and omissions all contributed to the same damage. In that respect their liability is concurrent. The liability of the vendors and Mr. Jacobucci is joint, and that of Ms. Mui is several. As concurrent torfeasors, the fault for the damage shall be apportioned equally among the four of them.  1) Credibility is not a science, see R. v. Gagnon, 2006 SCC 17. It is not always possible to articulate with precision the complex intermingling of impressions that emerge after watching and listening to witnesses and attempting to reconcile the various versions of events. The principles and tools to be used in assessing credibility are summarized in Novak Estate (Re), 2008 NSSC 283. 2) Certain of the evidence of the Karpinskis and Ms. Mui is so unreliable that the whole of their evidence is cast with doubt. 3) The opinions and conclusions of Mr. Loraas and Mr. Epp are accepted by the court. They are professionals with no interest in the outcome of the action. Their evidence was largely unchallenged. The Court finds that the pine shakes were rotten, sealant had been applied to the shakes on at least two occasions and prior to the plaintiff offering to buy the property, the shakes were not properly installed allowing water to seep into the house, the skylight leaked and caulking had been applied to stop the leaking before the plaintiff offered to buy the house, there was improper and inadequate venting which resulted in moisture damage to the interior of the house and mold in the attic, the moisture damage in the house included damage to drywall and paint blisters. Nail pops throughout the house were largely the result of the house being moved. No inspection was done after the house was moved. 4) The Court finds the Karpinskis did not speak truthfully or completely when they answered the questions in the Property Condition Disclosure Statement (PCDS). The Court does not accept that the vendors were not aware of water and moisture damage arising from the improperly installed shingles, the missing ridge caps, the leaking skylight or the lack of venting. The sealant on the roof was sufficiently old to predate the plaintiff's purchase of the house. The vendors repaired the sink holes and moisture pockets and effectively concealed the problems. It should have been disclosed. Although the vendors denied knowing of the structural damage to their house, they knew the house had been cut in half and moved 300 kilometers and had sustained damage. The structural problems were concealed by the vendors through repairs to the dry wall, reinforcement at stress points, and repainting and patching of wall paper. The fact that the house had been cut in half and moved should have been disclosed on the PCDS. 5) It is not only current defects or ongoing problems that need to be disclosed on a PCDS. A prospective purchaser does not look to the PCDS only to ascertain that the roof is not leaking on the day it was signed, see Kaufmann v. Gibson, [2007] O.J. No. 2711 (Ont. S.C.) (QL). The Karpinskis are liable to the plaintiff for breach of contract for failing to disclose the existence of structural defects, damage due to water and roof leakage. The terms of the PCDS formed part of the agreement between the parties and the deliberate withholding of this information amounted to a false representation as to the condition of the home. With respect to damage arising from these defects, the doctrine of caveat emptor does not apply. 6) The requirements for negligent misrepresentation have been established by the plaintiff. The failure to disclose, or silence as to a known defect, amounts to an act of concealment of a material fact and has the same effect as an express misrepresentation and is sufficient to attract liability, Thomas v. Blackwell, 1999 SKQB 168. 7) The false representations knowingly made by the vendors and their silence as to material facts were fraudulent. 8) Ms. Mui was negligent and her conduct and advice to the plaintiff fell below the standard of care expected of a realtor acting for the purchaser of a rural property in 1999. She did not conduct any preliminary background checks with the Rural Municipality, which would include determining if proper permits had been obtained, prior to the plaintiff's offer to purchase. Ms. Mui did nothing more than merely mention a home inspection to the plaintiff on one occasion. At no time did she recommend a home inspection even after she knew the house had been moved and before the condition regarding a satisfactory PCDS was removed. Another reason to strongly recommend a home inspection would be in circumstances where the realtor knew that a rural municipality did not require building inspections and Ms. Mui knew this to be the case. The plaintiff relied on the representation of Ms. Mui to her detriment. Had Ms. Mui disclosed all material facts to the plaintiff and explained and recommended a home inspection, the Court is satisfied that the outcome for the plaintiff would have been different. Knowing the house had been moved and had not been inspected the plaintiff would have most likely reconsidered her decision to purchase. 9) The Court is satisfied that Mr. Jacabucci is liable to the plaintiff for negligent misrepresentation. He represented that the home was of 'quality construction'. This was incorrect. Mr. Jacobucci was also complicit in, and party to, the negligent misrepresentations made by the vendors in the PCDS. He knew the house had been moved and sustained damage. He also knew the skylight leaked. The plaintiff relied on these misrepresentations and damages resulted.  10) The costs incurred by the plaintiff to repair the house total $17,613. She is awarded $15,000 as compensation for personal time and effort that she expended in repairing the home. There is no evidence that the distress the plaintiff experienced constituted a physical injury, or a recognized psychiatric illness and she cannot be compensated for mental distress, whether under tort or breach of contract. She is awarded $10,000 for aggravated damages. Her claim for punitive damages is dismissed. Her claim for solicitor and client costs is dismissed. Corrigendum received dated December 3, 2009 and added to fulltext.","The plaintiff, now Sylvia Schira, decided to purchase a home. She sought recovery of damages for alleged latent defects in the house. She engaged the services of Cecilia Mui, a realtor associated with the defendant, 100% Realty Associates Ltd. After lengthy search, the plaintiff purchased the property in 1998. It was owned by the defendants, Edward and Verl Karpinski. Their realtor was negligent in misrepresenting certain facts and breached the fiduciary duty expected of her. The defendants also claimed aggravated damages against all defendants and punitive damages against them for failing to give the plaintiff a Property Condition Disclosure Statement (PCDS) which formed a condition of the contract for sale. The PCDS was incorporated into the PCDS in the event that any defects existed. The realtor and her husband were liable to the plaintiff in damages in negligence and as parties to the misrepresentations made by the parties.","She says that Ms. Mui and RE/MAX Saskatoon fell below the standard of care required of a realtor representing the purchaser of a residential property. Mr. and Mrs. Karpinski, according to Ms. Schira, similarly misrepresented facts to her, negligently and fraudulently, both in information given to her which induced her, in part, to purchase the home, and in answers that they gave in a Property Condition Disclosure Statement (PCDS) which formed a condition of the contract for sale. 106) With the above in mind, I have determined that certain of the evidence of each of Mr. Karpinski, Mrs. Karpinski and Ms. Mui is so unreliable that the whole of their evidence is cast with doubt. I have, accordingly, accepted the observations of Mr. Loraas and the opinions of Mr. Epp. 123) In considering the liability of each of the defendants I have, as previously noted, accepted the conclusions and opinions of Mr. Loraas and Mr. Epp. In particular, I find:
(i) The pine shakes were rotting and many were cracked to such an extent that water could permeate the underlying joints and decking. 130) In this case, I have concluded that Mr. and Mrs. Karpinski did not speak “truthfully and completely” when answering all the questions in the PCDS. However, given their lack of veracity on key issues, I do not accept that they were unaware of other water and moisture damage, whether arising from the improperly installed shingles, the missing ridge caps, the leaking skylight or inadequate venting that was occurring elsewhere in the interior of the house. Accordingly I find Mr. and Mrs. Karpinski liable to Ms. Schira for breach of contract for failing to disclose in questions B, F and G of the PCDS the existence of structural defects, damage due to water, and roof leakage. The terms of the PCDS formed part of the agreement between the Karpinskis and Ms. Schira, and the deliberate withholding of this information amounted to a false representation as to the condition of the home. For reasons already set out, I would find that the false representations knowingly made by Mr. and Mrs. Karpinski, and their silence as to material facts, were fraudulent. I have concluded that Ms. Mui was negligent and that her conduct and advice to Ms. Schira fell below the standard of care expected of a realtor acting for the purchaser of a rural property in 1999. Further, had Ms. Mui fulfilled her obligation first to disclose all material facts to Ms. Schira, and second, to explain and, in these circumstances, recommend a home inspection, I am satisfied on a balance of probabilities that the outcome for Ms. Schira would have been different. 148) I am satisfied however that Mr. Jacobucci is liable to Ms. Schira for negligent misrepresentation. I award Ms. Schira $15,000 as compensation for the personal time and effort that she expended in repairing the house. However, there is no evidence that the distress that she experienced constituted a physical injury, or a recognized psychiatric illness. Conclusion 176) While Mr. and Mrs. Karpinski are liable for breach of contract, each of the defendants is a tortfeasor, each having breached an obligation or duty owed to Ms. Schira, whether through negligence or misrepresentation. 1. Ms. Schira shall have judgment against the defendants in the amount of $49,608.87. 2. Ms. Schira is entitled to pre-judgment interest under The Pre-Judgment Interest Act, S.S. 1984-85-86, c.

The inspection was conducted after the property was moved from its original location. 4) The home was too expensive for the plaintiff to afford.

The court found that he was not the realtor representing the purchaser of the residential property. He was a subcontractor for the rural municipality. He did not have the necessary experience or knowledge of the home construction. The work he did was done to ensure the house was built to code and to ensure that all necessary permits were in place. He failed to tell the plaintiff that the home had been moved over 300 km from its original building site. In so doing, it is alleged that the defendants breached the terms of their contract between them. There was no discussion about home inspection.","She says that Ms. Mui and RE/MAX Saskatoon fell below the standard of care required of a realtor representing the purchaser of a residential property. Mr. and Mrs. Karpinski, according to Ms. Schira, similarly misrepresented facts to her, negligently and fraudulently, both in information given to her which induced her, in part, to purchase the home, and in answers that they gave in a Property Condition Disclosure Statement (PCDS) which formed a condition of the contract for sale. 106) With the above in mind, I have determined that certain of the evidence of each of Mr. Karpinski, Mrs. Karpinski and Ms. Mui is so unreliable that the whole of their evidence is cast with doubt. I have, accordingly, accepted the observations of Mr. Loraas and the opinions of Mr. Epp. 123) In considering the liability of each of the defendants I have, as previously noted, accepted the conclusions and opinions of Mr. Loraas and Mr. Epp. In particular, I find:
(i) The pine shakes were rotting and many were cracked to such an extent that water could permeate the underlying joints and decking. 130) In this case, I have concluded that Mr. and Mrs. Karpinski did not speak “truthfully and completely” when answering all the questions in the PCDS. However, given their lack of veracity on key issues, I do not accept that they were unaware of other water and moisture damage, whether arising from the improperly installed shingles, the missing ridge caps, the leaking skylight or inadequate venting that was occurring elsewhere in the interior of the house. Accordingly I find Mr. and Mrs. Karpinski liable to Ms. Schira for breach of contract for failing to disclose in questions B, F and G of the PCDS the existence of structural defects, damage due to water, and roof leakage. The terms of the PCDS formed part of the agreement between the Karpinskis and Ms. Schira, and the deliberate withholding of this information amounted to a false representation as to the condition of the home. For reasons already set out, I would find that the false representations knowingly made by Mr. and Mrs. Karpinski, and their silence as to material facts, were fraudulent. I have concluded that Ms. Mui was negligent and that her conduct and advice to Ms. Schira fell below the standard of care expected of a realtor acting for the purchaser of a rural property in 1999. Further, had Ms. Mui fulfilled her obligation first to disclose all material facts to Ms. Schira, and second, to explain and, in these circumstances, recommend a home inspection, I am satisfied on a balance of probabilities that the outcome for Ms. Schira would have been different. 148) I am satisfied however that Mr. Jacobucci is liable to Ms. Schira for negligent misrepresentation. I award Ms. Schira $15,000 as compensation for the personal time and effort that she expended in repairing the house. However, there is no evidence that the distress that she experienced constituted a physical injury, or a recognized psychiatric illness. Conclusion 176) While Mr. and Mrs. Karpinski are liable for breach of contract, each of the defendants is a tortfeasor, each having breached an obligation or duty owed to Ms. Schira, whether through negligence or misrepresentation. 1. Ms. Schira shall have judgment against the defendants in the amount of $49,608.87. 2. Ms. Schira is entitled to pre-judgment interest under The Pre-Judgment Interest Act, S.S. 1984-85-86, c. P-22.2 calculated from February 8, 2000. 1. Ms. Schira shall have judgment against the defendants in the amount of $49,608.87.",0.42350332594235035,0.31578947368421056,"The plaintiff, now Sylvia Schira, decided to purchase a home. She hired the services of the defendant, Cecilia Mui, a realtor associated with the defendant 100% Realty Associates Ltd. After lengthy search, the plaintiff purchased the property in 1998. It was owned by the defendants, Edward and Verl Karpinski. Their realtor was a former employee of the municipality. She claimed that she suffered from mental and emotional distress as a result of the work undertaken. She also claimed aggravated damages against both parties for failing to obtain a Property Condition Disclosure Statement (PCDS) which formed a condition of the contract for sale. The PCDS was incorporated into the PCDS in the event that any defects were found in the home. The realtor and her husband were liable in negligence and as parties to the misrepresentations made by the parties, both in regard to the quality of the materials used and in the manner in which they had prepared the material for the inspection. HELD: 1) The court found that the defendant and Ms. Mui fell below the standard of care required of a real estate agent representing the purchaser of a residential property. The Court found that both parties were guilty of aggravated damages. 2) The Court rejected the offer of a wood-paneled skylight with asphalt shingles, which had been installed over the original wood. It would not have performed any of the repairs required of it as the wood was not of sufficient quality and would not last for 50 years. 3) The evidence from the parties who had inspected the property at the plaintiff's request was sufficient to warrant an inspection of the premises. There was no discussion of home inspection or home inspection at the time of the offer. The inspection was conducted after the property was moved from its original location. 4) The home was too expensive for the plaintiff to afford. The parties, along with the plaintiff, embarked upon an extensive search of the property for several years. The search for a suitable home expanded to acreages in the neighbouring environs. The rural municipality did not do any inspections of moved or newly constructed residences in the area. 5) The defendant's contractor was found to be a party to the proceedings and was held liable for approximately $1 million.",0.3616894705532421
7_2001nssc49.txt,"The parties were divorced two years ago and the matter had been finalized by an appeal decision in June, 1999. Both parties made application to vary child support on the basis of changes (ups and downs) in the farming business. The respondent wife, who recently purchased a house, also applied for lump sum spousal support which claim had been disallowed by the Court of Appeal. Monthly spousal support terminated as wife now self-sufficient; child support increased due to increase in husband's income; lump sum payment of $8,000 awarded to wife to help pay her relocation expenses from move with husband given six months to pay lump sum, but monthly spousal support to continue until the $8,000 was paid in full. Applications to vary should not be entertained simply because of the usual ups and downs of the farming business; the court must strive to average out the individual's ability to pay in such circumstances in order to ensure stability of payments for both parties. Lump sum spousal support payments must not have the effect of a significant redistribution of the division of matrimonial property but the reasons for the belated application must be examined.","The parties applied to vary spousal and/or child support less than 2 years after being divorced and less than 1 year after the Court of Appeal decision which settled the support awards of the trial judge. The husband originally claimed material change in circumstances based on his poor farming results in 1999 and the wife's improved employment and income situation. She now relies on a change in the husband's income position only. The wife has counter-claimed on the basis that the husband has increased his income since the trial in 1998 primarily because better up to date financial information is now available and because the husband received significant farm aid. She seeks a lump sum award to compensate for her relocation expenses. HELD: 1) The husband shall pay child support of $8,000 per month. Considering the moving expenses and the tax consequences of cashing in RRSP's and other expenses such as furniture, etc., the court found that a lump-sum award of this amount was warranted.  2) The parties had not addressed the question of costs directly pending the court's decision. It would appear that the great deal of expense has been incurred by both parties on these applications to vary. Costs may be difficult to justify but one would encourage the parties to explore some form of mediation if they had difficulty reaching an agreement in the future. 3) The Husband's income for support purposes is $41,000. He shall pay $567.00 per month in accordance with the Federal Child Support Guides. There should be stability of payments, both for the recipient and the payor. Expenses incurred due to the application to vary are material and should be taken into account. There will obviously be need for future adjustments as circumstances evolve with the growing children.

The husband had declared personal bankruptcy since the date of the original orders obtained under the Matrimonial Property Act and Divorce Act. HELD: 1)The husband's obligation to pay maintenance was reduced to $1 per month and the arrears accruing after the date of his assignment into bankruptcy were cancelled.  2)The wife's counsel requested that the court value and divide all of the matrimonial property equally notwithstanding the bankruptcy, because she might pursue a constructive trust claim for her 1/2 share as against the husband's trustee. 3)The court valued all of the matrimonial property and determined that 56% of this value should be paid to the wife, and only 44% to the husband, given amounts he had spent since the separation.  4)The court left unresolved the issue of which matrimonial assets might be exempt under the Bankruptcy Act and therefore available to the wife.","In November 1993 following a trial involving the divorce of the parties, including a corollary relief on such questions as spousal maintenance and division of matrimonial property, a judgment left the issue of the division of property until a later date.HELD: 1)The petitioner did not resume livestock operation on the farm for a number of reasons. His financial circumstances were dismal at the time of the judgment and he made a voluntary assignment into bankruptcy in February 1994. The petitioner filed a motion to vary the November maintenance order in light of his bankrupt financial situation and his inability to earn any income at this time. 2)The respondent did pay $2,300 by way of maintenance out of the proceeds of certain barley he sold privately. The respondent claims this was in violation of his original order prohibiting the sale of any assets of the marriage without consent of the other party or the court. 3)Division of property based on asset values which are at this stage problematical. The wife was granted 56% of the estimated asset value and the respondent 44% stake in the farm machinery. 4)When all of the assets were liquidated and the amount of money actually available for division was reduced by the value of a 1990 Oldsmobile which fix for sale at $9,000 in the petitioner's possession, each side shall bear their own costs.","1994. As a result a hearing date was set for May 13 at
which I was asked in accordance with my prior judgment to
complete the division of matrimonial property. In addition
the petitioner filed a motion seeking a variation of the
spousal maintenance order I made in November in light of his
bankrupt financial situation and his inability to earn any
income at this time. The evidence supports this position so I
hereby order that there shall be a variation of the previous
maintenance order down to the nominal sum of $1.00 per month
payable by the petitioner to the respondent commencing June 1,
1994 and continuing thereafter until further order of the
Court. On the
basis of the foregoing calculations I have granted the
respondent wife 56% of the estimated asset value and the
respondent husband 44%. When all of the assets have been
liquidated and it is determined what amount is actually
available for division then I direct it shall be divided based

The 38 year old had 49 prior convictions. The sentencing judge noted the accused's 3.5 years of sobriety, community support, education and technical trade training, and positive pre-sentence report but failed to consider the gravity of the offences, the need for deterrence, and above all, protection of the public.

HELD: The Crown appeal was allowed. 1)When one reviews the record it is easy to understand the position taken by the Crown which is for a penitentiary sentence. The judge noted the respondent's alcohol problem, his three and one-half years of sobriety and that the respondent did so well on probation he was released early at his own request in December 1999.

Appeal allowed to the extent of reducing the damages from $165,000 to $148,500.","This was an appeal from an assessment of damages in a wrongful dismissal action brought against Saskatchewan Transportation Company (STC) by the former president and chief executive officer of the corporation. For the most part we can find no tenable basis for concluding that the award of damages was inordinately high. The trial judge assessed the damages on the general principles, that the object of these awards is to compensate for the loss of income sustained in consequence of the wrongful dismissal; second, that their measure is prima facie the amount that would have been earned had the employment continued subject to deduction of such amounts as in the ensuing months. The question is why at the very least the net income of the company should not have been attributed to him on the premise his annual salary was $102,000 rather than $110,000. He resisted the attribution on pragmatic grounds, arguing that the company had not paid him any salary, that there was no guarantee the company was going to earn a profit, that it needed working capital, and so on. HELD: Appeal allowed. 1)The severance terms of the contract were arrived at with an eye to his earlier service. 2)The trial judge found that the appellant had met his duty to mitigate.

He had successively served three Crown Corporations over a period of ten years. On appeal held the award of damages was not inordinately high. The court however reduced the damages by $16,500 as it disagreed with the trial judge's determination regarding mitigation of damages.

The question is why at the very least the net income of the company should not have been attributed to him on the premise his annual salary was $102,000 rather than $110,000.

This defendant earlier sought to examine these individuals. The Justice of this action at that time did not allow the examination but instead made an order permitting the defendant to file affidavits on the issue. This is the source of the affidavit the plaintiff seeks cross-examination on. The order also allowed the plaintiffs to file reply affidavits, which they chose not to do. There is nothing in the original order that could be interpreted as saying that the plaintiffs could cross-examine on the affidavit. In the view of the Court, having chosen not to file reply affidavits pursuant to the original order, it is not reasonable for plaintiff's counsel to embark on a totally different approach several weeks after the deadline has passed.

The Court is aware of Lewis v. Shell, where an Ontario court ordered notice to potential class members. However, that case is not similar to this case. In the Lewis case, the Court was faced with concern over the defendant contacting individuals who might be potential class members for the purpose of obtaining early settlements. Moreover, the Ontario class actions legislation is less restrictive than Saskatchewan's. The section of the Class Action Act which may permit such an order refer to a 'class action,' not an 'action.' As this case is still in the pre-certification stage, it is not yet a class action within the meaning of the Act. Spavier v.

The plaintiffs sought to have the action proceed as a class action. The defendant moved to dismiss the claim against it on the basis that there was no plaintiff named in the statement of claim who purchased a Holguin vacation package from Red Seal. The Plaintiffs opposed the motion. HELD: The application was dismissed.  1) The Court's usual approach to civil litigation does not allow for plaintiff to demand defendant produce plaintiff. Secondary the wording of s.14 and s.24 of our Act in my view precludes this type of pre-certification notice.  2) In this case, the Court reviewed cases from Ontario and found that the service of notice (i.e. the defendant to give notice to the perspective plaintiffs) is limited to actions that have been certified as class actions. 3) It is important to note that this is still an 'action' and not a 'class action'. The Court was trying to determine the relevance of the viability issue in this case. It would appear that the court was concentrating more on common law regarding preliminary conflict objection than it did on remedial legislation. 4) Red Seal has had over the last couple of years ample opportunity to acquaint itself with prospective plaintiffs through'some...lawful manner'. The practice and implementation of the Rule of Court s.12 has been completely suspended for the past few years. The Court has not seen any cases where plaintiff was allowed to cross examine defendant on an affidavit. 5) The application for examination on the Moore affidavit was dismissed because the Court could not broaden the scope of the issue of examination of witnesses prior to certification.","Indeed Ottenbreit J. directed that the only thing the plaintiffs could do was to file a reply affidavit within three days. 17) In my view it is not reasonable for the MLG several weeks after the deadline for filing the reply affidavit to embark on a totally different approach (i.e. examining the affidavit as opposed to providing their own evidence). 18) It appears to me that the actual purpose of examining Ms. Moore is not to challenge her version of the circumstances leading up to the signing of the alleged settlement agreements by the Roussys, but rather a more general and broad ranging interrogation of Ms. Moore about other customers who may have booked through her office with Red Seal at the relevant time of this case. 19) Accordingly, based on the plain wording of Justice Ottenbreit J.’s judgment and the context of the preparation of the Moore affidavit; I must dismiss the application for examination on the Moore affidavit. This is still an “action” and not a “class action”. 68) I therefore dismiss both motions brought by MLG without costs.",0.38747553816046965,0.5342281879194631,"Counsel for the plaintiffs brings two notices of motion seeking 1) the opportunity to cross-examine a deponent on her affidavit and 2) an order to compel one of defendants to supply pre-certification notices to all persons who may be eligible to participate in the class action that is contemplated.

The defendant did not provide any evidence that the plaintiffs, through their counsel, Red Seal or others, had settled with the defendant and therefore could not be viable parties to the action. 2) The Court dismissed the application for examination on the Moore affidavit. It was not necessary to go into the whole issue of examination of witnesses prior to certification as it was not in the nature of a class action and the Court's inherent jurisdiction should be limited to actions that have been certified as class action.","Indeed Ottenbreit J. directed that the only thing the plaintiffs could do was to file a reply affidavit within three days. 17) In my view it is not reasonable for the MLG several weeks after the deadline for filing the reply affidavit to embark on a totally different approach (i.e. examining the affidavit as opposed to providing their own evidence). 18) It appears to me that the actual purpose of examining Ms. Moore is not to challenge her version of the circumstances leading up to the signing of the alleged settlement agreements by the Roussys, but rather a more general and broad ranging interrogation of Ms. Moore about other customers who may have booked through her office with Red Seal at the relevant time of this case. 19) Accordingly, based on the plain wording of Justice Ottenbreit J.’s judgment and the context of the preparation of the Moore affidavit; I must dismiss the application for examination on the Moore affidavit. This is still an “action” and not a “class action”. 68) I therefore dismiss both motions brought by MLG without costs.",0.43315508021390375,0.4013157894736842,"Counsel for the plaintiffs brings two notices of motion seeking 1) the opportunity to cross-examine a deponent on her affidavit and 2) an order to compel one of defendants to supply pre-certification notices to all persons who may be eligible to participate in the class action that is contemplated. HELD: The motions are dismissed with no order as to costs.  1) One of defendants contends that 7 people alleged by the plaintiffs to be viable class members have already entered into a full and final settlement with the defendant. This defendant earlier sought to examine these individuals. The Justice of this action at that time did not allow the examination but instead made an order permitting the defendant to file affidavits on the issue. This is the source of the affidavit the plaintiff seeks cross-examination on. The order also allowed the plaintiffs to file reply affidavits, which they chose not to do. There is nothing in the original order that could be interpreted as saying that the plaintiffs could cross-examine on the affidavit. In the view of the Court, having chosen not to file reply affidavits pursuant to the original order, it is not reasonable for plaintiff's counsel to embark on a totally different approach several weeks after the deadline has passed. There is also some concern that the actual purpose of the proposed cross-examination would be more general and broad-ranging than a mere challenge to the defendant's assertion that the individuals at issue have already entered into full and final settlements with the defendant.  2) In its barest sense, plaintiffs' counsel requests that the defendant supply a plaintiff by way of sending pre-certification notices to its clients. The Court is aware of Lewis v. Shell, where an Ontario court ordered notice to potential class members. However, that case is not similar to this case. In the Lewis case, the Court was faced with concern over the defendant contacting individuals who might be potential class members for the purpose of obtaining early settlements. Moreover, the Ontario class actions legislation is less restrictive than Saskatchewan's. The section of the Class Action Act which may permit such an order refer to a 'class action,' not an 'action.' As this case is still in the pre-certification stage, it is not yet a class action within the meaning of the Act. Spavier v. Canada also indicates that pre-certification motions of this sort would rarely be successful in this jurisdiction.","The defendant brought a motion pursuant to s. 12 of The Class Actions Act for an order compelling the plaintiff to produce a list of proposed class members who had been provided with a letter and related package by the defendant (relating to a test of their premises for contamination). The plaintiffs sought to have the action proceed as a class action. The defendant moved to dismiss the claim against it on the basis that there was no plaintiff named in the statement of claim who purchased a Holguin vacation package from Red Seal. The Plaintiffs opposed the motion. HELD: The application was dismissed.  1) The Court's usual approach to civil litigation does not allow for plaintiff to demand defendant produce plaintiff. Secondary the wording of s.14 and s.24 of our Act in my view precludes this type of pre-certification notice.  2) In this case, the Court reviewed cases from Ontario and found that the service of notice (i.e. the defendant to give notice to the perspective plaintiffs) is limited to actions that have been certified as class actions. 3) It is important to note that this is still an 'action' and not a 'class action'. The Court was trying to determine the relevance of the viability issue in this case. It would appear that the court was concentrating more on common law regarding preliminary conflict objection than it did on remedial legislation. 4) Red Seal has had over the last couple of years ample opportunity to acquaint itself with prospective plaintiffs through'some...lawful manner'. The practice and implementation of the Rule of Court s.12 has been completely suspended for the past few years. The Court has not seen any cases where plaintiff was allowed to cross examine defendant on an affidavit. 5) The application for examination on the Moore affidavit was dismissed because the Court could not broaden the scope of the issue of examination of witnesses prior to certification.","Indeed Ottenbreit J. directed that the only thing the plaintiffs could do was to file a reply affidavit within three days. 17) In my view it is not reasonable for the MLG several weeks after the deadline for filing the reply affidavit to embark on a totally different approach (i.e. examining the affidavit as opposed to providing their own evidence). 18) It appears to me that the actual purpose of examining Ms. Moore is not to challenge her version of the circumstances leading up to the signing of the alleged settlement agreements by the Roussys, but rather a more general and broad ranging interrogation of Ms. Moore about other customers who may have booked through her office with Red Seal at the relevant time of this case. 19) Accordingly, based on the plain wording of Justice Ottenbreit J.’s judgment and the context of the preparation of the Moore affidavit; I must dismiss the application for examination on the Moore affidavit.

d_2010skca52.txt,"The appellant contests an order for $600.00 monthly spousal support given by a Chambers judge on an application to review a previous order which granted the respondent $300.00 monthly spousal support for a period of 1 year. The parties were married for 24 years following a 2-year period of cohabitation. They have 2 adult children, one of which is largely supported by the appellant. Both parties have some health problems. Originally, the appellant was ordered to pay the respondent $300.00 in monthly spousal support for a period of 1 year. Given the appellant's health difficulties and the fact that he was nearing retirement, the trial judge noted that the respondent would do well to become self-sufficient as soon as possible. The Chambers judge who reviewed the original order found that, during the year period the respondent was collecting spousal support, she had not engaged in any gainful employment. She had sold her house and used the proceeds to spend over 4 months living in Hawaii and Jamaica. She obtained probationary employment just after filing a notice of motion but lost the job before the hearing commenced. HELD: The appeal is allowed, the orders of the Chambers judge for spousal support and costs against the appellant are set aside. The Chambers judge imputed an income of $14,289 to the respondent on the basis that she was capable of working 30 hours per week at minimum wage. He did not indicate why he did not find her capable of full time employment. The Chambers judge made an error in calculating the income of the appellant. He also discounted the expenses borne by the appellant in relation the maintenance of their adult child, who was a full-time student.

The parties separated in 2003 after 24 years of marriage following two years of cohabitation. At the time of the judgment, the respondent was 60 years old and the appellant was 53. They had two adult children, born in 1984 and 1989 respectively. The respondent was working and living with the appellant after the parties' separation and had been diagnosed with breast cancer and had surgery followed up by radiation. She also had shingles and an attack in the nature of stroke in 2006. The appellant was receiving social assistance in the amount of $14,000 annually. HELD: The appeal was allowed orally from the bench. 1) The evidence before Sandomirsky J. established that during the year following the one year order of Ottenbreit J. the respondent had not engaged in any gainful employment at all. She had sold her house and used the proceeds to spend over four months out of Canada, living in Hawaii part of the time and spending a month-long vacation in Jamaica. She paid for her adult children to visit her. Finally, on April 14, 2009, she commenced employment at Westfair Foods in a probationary position. This was after the year prior to the judgment had expired and only a few days prior to filing the application to review that order and to award to her substantial permanent spousousal support. Prior to the hearing of her application, she lost this position and said in her affidavits, filed in support of the application, that she was 'disabled and still receiving treatments' (that she was still receiving treatment, but was able to work 40 hours a week at minimum wage), that she still had the same medical issues and the couples' daughter was still living with him and going to university full time. The chambers judge discounted the relevance of the expenses of maintaining the respondent on the basis she was over 18, without determining whether she was a child of the marriage as a full time student. She did not indicate why he did not find her capable of full time employment. 2) The appellant's 2007 income was an error, as it failed to take into account employment expenses of $8,822 allowed by Canada Revenue Agency and expressly found by the chambers judge to be reasonable. The proper income for the appellant, still in the neighbourhood of $30,000, weighed against retroactive support of $600 per month.

The court applied the standard of review which it did in R. v. Garofoli, [1990] S.C.R. 1421 for the purpose of reviewing the judge's decision. It held that the judge erred in law by failing to apply the test which he was required to apply in this case: whether there was enough evidence to establish a credibly based probability that an offence had been committed and that there would be evidence of it to be found in the place of search. In this case, the court substituted its view of the judge with that of the issuing judge.","Held: The appeal is allowed and a new trial is ordered, as per reasons for judgment of MacDonald, C.J.N.S.; Cromwell and Fichaud, JJ.A. concurring.

Although the Information to Obtain was based on information from an anonymous, unproven source, the source's information was corroborated by independent information as to the accused's employment and residence. The only corroboration of the presence of a crime (a suspected marijuana grow operation) was from a FLIR test. The court found that the evidence did not rise above the level of suspicion, albeit strong suspicion. Corroboration of the employment and residence of the accused did not provide particular support for the informant's credibility; neither were results of the FLIR test and the presence of covered windows sufficient corroboration. The Crown appealed. Appeal allowed; new trial ordered. Although the trial judge articulated the proper test and began by analyzing whether the warrant could have been issued, the issue was later mistakenly transformed into whether he, himself, would have issued it. By weighing the probative evidence, the trial judge effectively substituted his views for those of the issuing justice and wrongly required the issuing justice to draw proper inferences as opposed to reasonable inferences.","The respondent challenged the validity of a search warrant, alleging that it was issued without sufficient information. The judge agreed to quash the warrant and the respondent was acquitted. The Crown appealed, arguing that the judge erred in law by excluding the evidence obtained in the search. Appeal allowed; new trial ordered. The court found that the respondent had reasonable and probable grounds to believe that she was growing marijuana in her basement, given the limited information available regarding the grow operation. It also found that there was evidence confirming the respondent's acquittal. However, the appeal court questioned whether the judge applied the proper standard of review, noting that even had the warrant been properly quashed, the findings of the FLIR testing and observations about the covered windows were insufficient to overcome the weaknesses in the source's evidence. HELD: Appeal allowed. A new trial was ordered.  1) On the evidence, there was no breach of s.8 and s.9 of the Charter.  2) The court substituted its view of the law for that of the issuing judge. It is an extricable legal error which the court must address. In R. v. Garofoli, [1990] S.C.R. 1421, an example of an error where the law requires a certain level of probability to be applied, but the judge did not err in this regard. Rather, she applied the correct standard based on common sense and probative principles. The principles outlined by Sopinka were applied to this case. 3) The judge began his analysis by properly considering whether the respondent could issue the warrant but effectively ended up considering whether he would have issued the warrant in these circumstances. The reviewing judge substituted her discretion for those of the issued judge. 4) The Court found that a review of the judge's decision involving the use of common sense principles in the context of a trial does not amount to an analysis of the issues between the parties as a whole. The proper standard must be applied to determine whether a decision has been made with respect to the application of the common sense principle of probative justice, which was not applied here.","Held: The appeal is allowed and a new trial is ordered, as per reasons for judgment of MacDonald, C.J.N.S.; Cromwell and Fichaud, JJ.A. concurring.

HELD: At a sentencing hearing, the Crown must prove aggravating factors beyond a reasonable doubt. The Court held that the two victims were sexually assaulted by the accused on numerous occasions over a period of a number of years. The Court was satisfied these sexual assaults were a common occurrence on every occasion that the accused was in the company of his granddaughters. The Court found that the accused touched the victims under their clothing on numerous occasions and that there were a couple of occasions that the accused digitally penetrated each victim.

There was no medical evidence or corroboration of the digital penetration and the accused testified that he could not say the frequency of the assaults but did not recall them ever not happening.

At a creditors meeting the defendant advised the creditors' counsel of the initial three letters of direction. The project was considered viable by the creditors and continued, with the defendant obtaining postponements of the three letters of direction.

The plaintiff sought postponements of two of the drawings in order to allow them to be paid off. The first drawing had an overrun and the project at this time had a cash flow problem. The second drawing was of significant concern to the creditors as they were beginning to doubt the viability of the project and the ultimate payment of their accounts. For the plaintiff, that the solicitor had disbursed funds contrary to the letter of direction and that he broke the undertaking contained in that acknowledgement. The plaintiffs sought to recover the disbursements and sought damages against the defendant for negligent misrepresentation and breach of trust. Finding for the plaintiffs, that although the solicitor was a conscientious solicitor, always attempting to be in strict compliance with the terms of his retainer and endeavouring to avoid any apparent conflicts of interest, and to follow the instructions of his clients, subject to any limitations which had been placed upon him through various written directions, he was never in a fiduciary relationship with the plaintiffs or retained by them or purport to act for them or on their behalf.","The plaintiffs have also raised an allegation of breach of trust on the part of Mr. Brookes; however, there is no evidence Mr. Brookes was ever in a fiduciary relationship with the plaintiffs, nor was he ever retained by the plaintiffs or purport in any way to act for them or on their behalf. In my respectful opinion the plaintiffs have not established the basis for a claim under breach of trust and cannot succeed on this ground. Firstly, I am not persuaded that the creditors continued to advance supplies to the project on the basis of Mr. Brookes\' letter of March 11, 1987 and, on a balance of probabilities, I find that the suppliers continued advancing to the project because they concluded that the project was still viable. Therefore, on this basis there can be no reliance by these latter creditors and it is impossible to see how they could have a claim for breach of an undertaking which is not communicated or directed to them before they provided their services or materials. In my respectful opinion, in the case at bar, one cannot interpret Mr. Brookes\' letter of March 11, 1987 in the abstract or in a vacuum and one must consider all of the surrounding circumstances, including the knowledge of the plaintiffs, through the Creditors\'Committee and their representatives, the letters of March 12, March 13 and March 16, 1987 and the various meetings resulting in those letters. Decision On the basis of the findings and conclusion reached, I therefore dismiss all the claims of the plaintiffs against the defendant, with costs.",0.46963562753036436,0.4063400576368876,"The plaintiff sought to have the defendant's solicitor disburse funds from mortgage draws and insurance claims to the project.

He is awarded general damages of $12,500. 3) The pleadings and the affidavit evidence do not support a substantial award for aggravated damages. However, the photographs graphically depict the extent to which his appearance was altered. Hurt feelings can reasonably be inferred from the fact that the plaintiff was rendered unconscious on the ground in a crowd of onlookers. These circumstances justify an award of aggravated damages in the sum of $2,000. 4) The plaintiff was awarded special damages in the amount of $1,911.70.","The plaintiff was standing with other patrons near the entrance to the pub when he was punched in the face and knocked unconscious by the defendant. Liability was admitted and the plaintiff now applied for summary judgment and an assessment of damages pursuant to Rule 485. HELD: The plaintiff was awarded general damages of $12,500.00 plus costs and pre-judgment interest.  1)The court reviewed Queen's Bench Rule 153 (which requires a party to plead specifically any matter, fact or point of law which, if not specifically pleaded, might take the other party by surprise) and found that a fair award for general damages was $12.500. 2)The plaintiff did not plead a claim for aggravated damages. The photographs attached to the plaintiff's affidavit graphically depict the extent to which his appearance was altered by his extensive facial injuries, perhaps more effectively than words could have done. To some extent, as well, the requisite 'hurt feelings' can reasonably be inferred from the fact that the plaintiff was rendered unconscious on the ground in a crowd of onlookers.  3)There was no evidence that aggravated damages were necessary to sustain the assault. The plaintiff suffered significant pain and suffering for a number of months after the assault and further treatment was required in the future. There was some minimal scarring and disfigurement but it was not significant. Excluding any component for aggravated damage the court awarded a fair value of $13,500 to the defendant for non-pecuniary loss.","Liability is admitted, and the plaintiff now applies for summary judgment and an assessment of damages pursuant to Rule 485. I accept that the plaintiff suffered significant pain and suffering for a number of months after the assault. Excluding any component for aggravated damages I conclude that a fair award for general damages is $12,500.00. In that sense the pleadings and the evidence do not support a substantial award for aggravated damages. To some extent, as well, the requisite “hurt feelings” can reasonably be inferred from the fact that the plaintiff was rendered unconscious on the ground in a crowd of onlookers. I have decided that those circumstances justify an award of aggravated damages in the sum of $2,000.00. SUMMARY [21] The plaintiff shall have judgment against the defendant calculated as follows:



(1) General damages $12,500.00
(2) Aggravated damages $ 2,000.00
(3) Special damages $ 1,911.70

The father has been living with the grandmother for the past few years and is in the process of obtaining an order for the grandparents to have access together.HELD: 1) An interim order was granted in March 2009 specifying the father would have access with the children for three weekends in a row with no access on the fourth weekend. This agreement was considered an interim arrangement to be tried by the parties. It is clear there were concerns regarding the father's use of alcohol and drugs. His access was stated to be 'no more than one hour every two or three days'. He opposed the mother's claim for custody and her request that the children be designated beneficiaries of any life insurance, pension plan or health care plan he owned and she opposed his request that she be allowed to appoint a person to have custody of them and be guardian of the property upon her death. There was no difficulty in determining that the grandmother was a person with sufficient interest. 2) The designation of the grandmother as Person of sufficient Interest on an interim basis does not bind the court as a result of s. 6 of The Children’s Law Act 1997. The designation is made pursuant to s.6 of the Childrens’ Law Act, 1997. 3) The Court of Appeal was dealing with a request by a third party for access visits with the mother and two boys. He sought an order that he have custody. He was absent for approximately four years. 4) It is not disputed that the father has used drugs. He smoked marijuana and hashish but said he never did meth on a regular basis. When the parties were in the hospital, the father was charged with assault. He indicated he signed a peace bond to 'get it over with'. The father said he had to quit or was fired as result of false allegations being made about him. He said he was not opposed to the grandmother having reasonable and liberal access. The relationship between the father and the children was tumultuous prior to the mother initiating this relationship.

The issues must be determined. 1) The grandmother was granted interim custody in March 2009. In August 2015 the Court of Appeal was dealing with a request by a third party for access with the parties' two boys. He sought an order that he have custody of them. 2) The father was granted supervised access to the boys for three weekends in a row with no access on the fourth weekend. 3) In January 2016 a pre-trial settlement conference was reconvened. Unfortunately no agreement could be reached regarding the ongoing parenting arrangement. The matter then proceeded to trial before the Court on January 26, 2017. It is clear there were concerns regarding the father's use of alcohol and drugs. He did not dispute the mother's claim for declaration of parentage, her claim for child support and her request that the children be designated beneficiaries of any life insurance, pension plan or health care plan he owned. 4) There was an interim order in place in January 2016 which ordered the father to pay child support for the children for the rest of their lives. In accordance with the Workplace Safety and Insurance Board letter, the grandmother's monthly payments will be adjusted every year to account for cost of living. In addition to the monthly pension funds the grandmother received a lump sum payment of $69,000. Finally, the father was to have access for the summer of 2017 in an approximately equal arrangement to those of the grandmother.","[17] There is an interim order designating the grandmother as a person of sufficient interest.

At the end of trial, the applicant requested the Court to reserve on the matter of costs. The applicant intended to make a submission for award of solicitor and clients costs. Evidence was led at trial about insubstantial offers made directly between the parties. Further evidence now indicates that substantial offers were made through council although not led at trial. The applicant argues that solicitor and client costs of $70,000 should be awarded because the offer to settle of $250,000 is close to the total judgment award of $230,000 including party and party costs of $20,000. The respondent takes the position that the estate was willing to pay reasonable maintenance costs and the quantum of maintenance could have been summarily determined without the necessity of extensive discoveries and without a lengthy trial. The respondent submits the approach of a needs-based assessment was upheld by the judgment and is always the approach always taken on behalf of the estate. The respondent argues the real question is whether the parties were acting bona fide during their negotiations and the issue should not be determined on the basis of the closeness of the offers. HELD: Solicitor and Client Costs of $70,000 are not appropriate in this case. The applicant's conduct was not entirely pure. The applicant was made aware in a prior judgment that under The Dependants' Relief Act there is nothing to indicate that a person is entitled to part of an estate as a beneficiary but rather that a beneficiary is entitled to maintenance. In spite of this ruling the applicant continued to claim the whole of the estate and to pursue full disclosure of the financial worth of the estate. Solicitor and client costs are within the discretion of the court but such discretion is exercise only in rare and exceptional circumstances. The conduct of the respondent cannot be characterized as reprehensible, scandalous or outrageous. The respondent's unwillingness to make full financial disclosure did contribute to the increase of costs but is insufficient to merit full solicitor and client costs. The Court awards fixed costs to the applicant in the amount of $47,000 together with disbursements.","The applicant applied for amendment of the judgment. At the conclusion of trial, counsel requested that costs on the basis of Column IV of the Tariff of Costs be reserved on the subject of costs. The issues were: 1) the issue of costs and whether the parties were acting bona fide during their negotiations and that substantial offers were made directly to the applicant. The applicant argued that the judge had intended to make a submission for award of solicitor and client costs of approximately $70,000. The respondent argued that there was no evidence before the Court at trial about substantive offers made by the parties; 2) the applicant intended to claim the whole of the estate and to pursue full disclosure of its financial worth. It was now clear that the applicant had always claimed the entire estate but did not have the complete evidence as to all offers made. The application for settlement was dismissed. The court ordered fixed costs in the amount of $47,000, together with disbursements.  3) The Executions Act states that interest runs 'from the time of entering judgment' and not from the date of entering formal judgment.

The Court ordered that the respondent pay post-judgment interest at a rate of five percent per annum for the period from March 19, 1999 in accordance with s. 30 of the Executions' Act and until judgment is satisfied.  4) Special circumstances which compel the reconsideration included the respondent's failure to prosecute or defend the action; there is a substantial monetary difference between party and party costs awarded in the judgment and the solicitor-and-client costs claimed by the applicant; the length of time to trial and the number of interim applications were partially attributable to the defendant who continued to make exaggerated claims for the whole estate well past the time when it was appropriate; 5) the respondent has been awaiting the outcome of this application in order to satisfy the judgment;  6) special circumstances which may have led to further litigation (e.g. the trial judge made an offer of settlement in September 1996 but the applicant failed to make any effort to settle the matter; the applicant's conduct was not entirely pure; and the applicant did not make any genuine effort to contribute to the cause of seeking settlement.","[1] The applicant applies for amendment of my judgment of March 19, 1999 insofar as it relates to costs.

Childs Estate, [1988] 1 W.W.R. 746, there is no doubt that a judge has the power, under Rule 7 of s. 44 of The Queen's Bench Act, R.S.S. 1978, c. Q-1, to enforce or set aside an agreement compromising an action by summary proceedings.

6_2000skqb94.txt,"A jury determined the plaintiff was constructively dismissed from his employment as park superintendent in 1997 and awarded damages for failure to give reasonable notice. The defendant claimed the contract of employment was all inclusive; that the plaintiff exaggerated the amount of time he spent on the job in winter; that the reduced winter hours were not in lieu of overtime pay as he was a manager within the meaning of s.4(2) of the LSA; the doctrine of estoppel or waiver applied as he never claimed a right to holiday pay for 10 years and the employer relied on his not doing so; if the plaintiff is entitled to holiday pay he should only recover back to April 1990 as he is limited by the Limitation of Actions Act; it should not be based on wages plus truck allowance as wages as defined in the LSA does not include allowances for costs. The claim for unpaid holiday pay claimed from April 1988 to October 1997, based on his wages plus one-half his truck expense allowance, was reserved pending a decision by the Court of Appeal as to whether the Court of Queen's Bench has jurisdiction to determine the issue of entitlement to holiday pay. HELD: The claim was dismissed with costs.  1)The Court of Appeal held in Kolodziejski v. Auto Electric Service that the Queens' Bench has jurisdiction to entertain a civil action for non-payment of holiday pay. 2)The plaintiff may rely on s.30(1) of the LSA to establish he is entitled to holidays and on s.33 to establish he entitled to pay in lieu of taking holidays. The onus then shifts to the defendant to prove it complied with some exception in the LSA. Section 75 prevents an employee from waiving his or her entitlement. Whether the plaintiff asserted his right to holiday pay or not, he remained entitled to his annual holidays in accordance with the LSA. 3)The plaintiff can claim for any holiday pay in lieu of time off that he can establish he was entitled to from April 1990 to his termination date. Section 3(1)(f)of the LAA states that a cause of action for recovery of money under a contract, express or implied, must be commenced within 6 years of the date on which the cause arose. 4)The plaintiff clearly indicated that a portion of the truck allowance was made to avoid paying tax. As such it would be contrary to public policy for the Court to appear to endorse the plaintiff's actions by calculating his holiday pay on the basis of his wage and this portion of his truck allowance.  5)The defendant's position that the contract included a component of holiday pay each month was inconsistent with its position that the plaintiff took these days off as holidays during the year. The contract of employment did not include a component of holiday pay in lieu of time off.  6)Failure by the defendant to keep records for the purpose of inspection by the minister does not result in a reverse onus. The onus remains on the plaintiff to establish what holidays he did not take. 7)The plaintiff admitted to taking time away from his duties for personal time and for city business as mayor. The plaintiff was not there in his capacity as superintendent. Section 31(1)(b) indicates that an employee shall be permitted to take holidays in one uninterrupted period. The defendant allowed the plaintiff to take days off in any manner he chose. It was inconsistent that the plaintiff's failure to comply with the notice requirement meant for the benefit of the employer could be used by an employee to disclaim that his days off were holidays. 8)The plaintiff was clearly a manager within the meaning of LSA. Even if he were not a manager, he failed to prove, on a balance of probabilities that he worked overtime hours in excess of the statutory minimum in order to qualify for overtime. Any days off taken by the plaintiff could not be considered taken in lieu of overtime. The days he was away were holidays as defined in s.30 of the LSA. 9)He did not establish he did 3 weeks holidays.","The plaintiff sued for damages from the defendant alleging he was constructively wrongfully dismissed from his employment with the defendant. The plaintiff elected to have the determination of liability and the assessment of damages determined by a civil jury. The jury determined that the plaintiff was constructedively dismissed and awarded the plaintiff $250,000 in damages. In addition to the claim for damages for failure to give reasonable notice of termination, the plaintiff asserted a claim against the defendant for unpaid holiday pay that he alleged was owing to him at the date of termination.HELD: The jury trial was to proceed as to the issue of holiday pay and the amount on which any holiday entitlement should be based, in the event the plaintiff proves he is entitled to holiday pay. The court reviewed the LSA and found that holiday pay should not be based on the wage and truck allowance as it was a wage disguised for the purposes of avoiding paying income tax. The LSA definition does not include an expense allowance and the plaintiff's truck allowance was not included in the calculation of his holiday pay entitlement. As the plaintiff clearly indicated that the $250 portion of his truck allowance, made to avoid paying tax, was not a holiday pay penalty and as such, it would be contrary to public policy for the defendant to appear to endorse his actions by calculating holiday pay on the basis of his wage, truck allowance and travel expenses. Any holiday pay owing to the plaintiff will be calculated only on the plaintiff’s wage. The defendant was to pay the plaintiff holiday pay in lieu of time off.","Further it asserts that the reduced winter hours were not in lieu of overtime pay, as the plaintiff was a “manager” within the meaning of s. 4(2) of the LSA and therefore not entitled to overtime. [24] Further, the defendant claims that if the court finds that the plaintiff is entitled to holiday pay, the plaintiff should only be entitled to recover back to April 1990 as the plaintiff is limited by The Limitation of Actions Act, R.S.S. 1978, c. L-15 which only allows recovery of money under a contract up to six years after the cause of action arises. In this case I am not convinced that the contract of employment included a component of holiday pay in lieu of time off.

The defendant claimed the contract of employment was all inclusive; that the plaintiff exaggerated the amount of time he spent on the job in winter; that the reduced winter hours were not in lieu of overtime pay as he was a manager within the meaning of s.4(2) of the LSA; the doctrine of estoppel or waiver applied as he never claimed a right to holiday pay for 10 years and the employer relied on his not doing so; if the plaintiff is entitled to holiday pay he should only recover back to April 1990 as he is limited by the Limitation of Actions Act; it should not be based on wages plus truck allowance as wages as defined in the LSA does not include allowances for costs. The claim for unpaid holiday pay claimed from April 1988 to October 1997, based on his wages plus one-half his truck expense allowance, was reserved pending a decision by the Court of Appeal as to whether the Court of Queen's Bench has jurisdiction to determine the issue of entitlement to holiday pay. HELD: The claim was dismissed with costs.  1)The Court of Appeal held in Kolodziejski v. Auto Electric Service that the Queens' Bench has jurisdiction to entertain a civil action for non-payment of holiday pay. 2)The plaintiff may rely on s.30(1) of the LSA to establish he is entitled to holidays and on s.33 to establish he entitled to pay in lieu of taking holidays. The onus then shifts to the defendant to prove it complied with some exception in the LSA. Section 75 prevents an employee from waiving his or her entitlement. Whether the plaintiff asserted his right to holiday pay or not, he remained entitled to his annual holidays in accordance with the LSA. 3)The plaintiff can claim for any holiday pay in lieu of time off that he can establish he was entitled to from April 1990 to his termination date. Section 3(1)(f)of the LAA states that a cause of action for recovery of money under a contract, express or implied, must be commenced within 6 years of the date on which the cause arose. 4)The plaintiff clearly indicated that a portion of the truck allowance was made to avoid paying tax. As such it would be contrary to public policy for the Court to appear to endorse the plaintiff's actions by calculating his holiday pay on the basis of his wage and this portion of his truck allowance.  5)The defendant's position that the contract included a component of holiday pay each month was inconsistent with its position that the plaintiff took these days off as holidays during the year. The contract of employment did not include a component of holiday pay in lieu of time off.  6)Failure by the defendant to keep records for the purpose of inspection by the minister does not result in a reverse onus. The onus remains on the plaintiff to establish what holidays he did not take. 7)The plaintiff admitted to taking time away from his duties for personal time and for city business as mayor. The plaintiff was not there in his capacity as superintendent. Section 31(1)(b) indicates that an employee shall be permitted to take holidays in one uninterrupted period. The defendant allowed the plaintiff to take days off in any manner he chose. It was inconsistent that the plaintiff's failure to comply with the notice requirement meant for the benefit of the employer could be used by an employee to disclaim that his days off were holidays. 8)The plaintiff was clearly a manager within the meaning of LSA. Even if he were not a manager, he failed to prove, on a balance of probabilities that he worked overtime hours in excess of the statutory minimum in order to qualify for overtime. Any days off taken by the plaintiff could not be considered taken in lieu of overtime. The days he was away were holidays as defined in s.30 of the LSA. 9)He did not establish he did 3 weeks holidays.","The plaintiff sued for damages from the defendant alleging he was constructively wrongfully dismissed from his employment with the defendant. The plaintiff elected to have the determination of liability and the assessment of damages determined by a civil jury. The jury determined the plaintiff was constructedively dismissed and awarded the plaintiff damages. In addition to the claim for damages for failure to give reasonable notice of termination, the plaintiff asserted a claim against the defendant for unpaid holiday pay that he alleged was owing to him at the date of termination. The defendant argued that the plaintiff's hours of work were very flexible in the winter and that if the plaintiff did not take all of his 1990-1991 holidays by March 1992, the defendant would have been required to pay the plaintiff holiday pay in lieu of time off. HELD: The plaintiff was awarded judgment for $250,000.00.  1) It would be contrary to public policy for the Court of Appeal to appear to endorse the defendant's actions by calculating his holiday pay on the basis of his wage and this portion of his truck allowance. Any holiday pay owing to the plaintiff will be calculated only on the plaintiff’s wage. 2) The plaintiff can rely on the LSA definition of 'wages' to establish he is entitled to holiday pay. The LSA does not include an expense allowance. 3) In this case the plaintiff clearly indicated that the $250.00 portion of the truck allowance was made to avoid paying tax. 4) In Kolodziejski v. Auto Electric Service Ltd. (1999), 177 Sask. R. 197, the court held that the doctrine of estoppel or waiver should apply to prevent the plaintiff from claiming his entitlement to holidays. The doctrine was not applicable in this case. 5) The court reviewed the various types of awards made to an employee where he loses an employment benefit that also benefitted him personally. The Court would be substantially prejudiced if he was now allowed to assert that right. Whether the plaintiff claimed his right to holidays or holiday pay for 10 years and, that the defendant relied on it in this regard. 6) The trial of this matter was reconvened before myself for determination on the issue of the plaintiffs claim for unpaid holidays.","Further it asserts that the reduced winter hours were not in lieu of overtime pay, as the plaintiff was a “manager” within the meaning of s. 4(2) of the LSA and therefore not entitled to overtime.

The Crown admitted that ss.300 and 301 limited an individual's right to freedom of expression as provided by s.2 of the Charter but argued that this infringement was justified under s.1 of the Charter.

The action against the defendants was consolidated and joined against the Attorney General. The AG did not consent to the discontinuation of the action. The plaintiff sued for negligence. Dismissing the action, that in order to establish whether there was a duty of care owed by defendant to plaintiff, the plaintiff had to first establish that the tree fell due to DED, and then establish that it was caused by the fungus Ganoderma applanatum. This fungus was common on stumps but rare on the area of a wound parasite. An expert should then examine the wound.

b_2000skqb36.txt,"The accused, Cote, applied for remedy pursuant to s.24 of the Charter of Rights stating that he was denied the right to be tried on a fraud charge within a reasonable time. Twenty-two months passed between the laying of the charge and the trial date. Cote was not responsible for the delay and actively pursued a speedy trial. The delay was caused by the Crown's failure to provide timely disclosure. HELD: The charge was stayed. In applying the decision of the SCC in R. v. Morin, the court found that 22 months is an unreasonable and exceptional period of delay and is of sufficient length to warrant an inquiry. This case had no particular complexity above the norm for cases of this kind and did not require this delay. Cote did not directly or indirectly waive his s.11(b) right to be tried within a reasonable time. Cote was subject to substantial and sufficient prejudice by the delay. He suffered damage to his political career, embarrassment from media reports, unemployment, and economic hardship. The court balanced the individual's right to be tried within a reasonable time with society's interest in having the matter proceed to trial despite delay. Here the defence was not seeking to delay the trial and use the protective shield of s.11(b)as an offensive weapon.","The accused was committed to stand trial on one of the fraud charges and now applies for a remedy pursuant to s. 24 of the Charter of Rights. The application is based primarily on the accused's position that he has been denied the right to be tried on the fraud charge within a reasonable time. HELD: The Court finds that the accused has been prejudiced by the delay. 1) The length of delay has been substantial and sufficient to tilt the balance in favour of requiring a judicial stay. This is not an exceptional case. 2) Given the facts, the inherent time requirements of the case require a 22-month delay from charge to trial. 3) In this case of eight months, the Crown made no disclosure at all. The preliminary hearing was adjourned to September because of scheduling difficulty. The Crown indicated that it was prepared to look at dates in November. In such circumstances, the earliest available five consecutive days of court time in Kamsack was not until Monday February 8. This was a generous period of time which should have given the Crown ample opportunity to provide full disclosure well before commencement of the preliminary hearing.

The court found that taking into account all of the factors considered, the plaintiff put forward a realistic assessment of an appropriate notice period of 7 months. Taking into account the plaintiff’s record for the previous six years and his exemplary conduct during that time, the notice should reflect that management positions are fewer in number than non-management positions, and that there is a considerable wage difference between a management position and a non-managed one.","[1] The plaintiff applies for summary judgment in his claim for dismissal without just cause brought pursuant to the simplified procedure outlined in Part Forty of the Rules of Court.

4_2008skqb174.txt,"Accused pleaded guilty at opening of trial to one count of distributing child pornography in the form of written works. The accused was active on a pedophile website and posted 11 stories describing sexual activity between men and infants and pre-teen girls. HELD: Accused received 15 months imprisonment followed by 3 years of probation with addition orders including providing DNA samples and being added to the Sex Offender Registry. The Court accepted that the internet has led to the accelerated proliferation of child pornography, making it an increasing social problem. The social harm of such material is borne almost exclusively by infants and children, the most defenceless members of society. For this reason, denunciation and deterrence are the dominant sentencing principles. The defence submitted that the writings do not actually harm children in their making and, therefore, should not be subject to the same denunciation as pornographic images. The Court rejected this argument because it cannot be assumed that the writings do not stimulate the demand for images and since not all pedophiles are voyeurs only some will act on their desires and anything that stimulates this desire places children at risk in the real world. Aggravating factors in this case were 1) the fact that the accused extolled pedophilia and wrote hard core child pornography and encouraged others to the same. 2) The accused was a high profile contributor to the web site and he remains unrepentant Ã» he does not believe there is anything wrong with writing these stories and only stopped because the law requires it. A conditional sentence would not represent sufficient denunciation or deterrence. Mitigating factors in this case included a lack of criminal record, the guilty plea and the fact that the accused is looking after his elderly mother.","The defendant pled guilty at the opening of trial to one count of distributing child pornography contrary to s. 163.1(3) of the Criminal Code. The defendant had 1,200 postings on his website, which included 11 stories that included 11 described sexual activity between adults and either infants or preteen girls. The moderator of the website encouraged stories and the defendant encouraged others to submit stories. He stated he did not own a computer, had never owned a computer and did not intend to again access the internet. He submitted that his stories were largely fantasies of what he wished to do with those two girls when they were under his roof. Criminal Code s. 161(1) protects the rights of writers, and artists who write sex stories concerning pre-teen girls, which on the scale of written child pornography places it in the upper half of the scale. The fact that the defendant wrote the stories was an important mitigating factor. HELD: The defendant was sentenced to 15 months imprisonment to be followed by a term of probation of 3 years. 1) The Court took into account the mitigating factors referred to in the pre-sentence report, along with the other material relevant to the case. 2) The defendant complied with the terms of his three year probation order. He directly encouraged other to produce similar stories which is an aggravating factor in the offence.  3) There was no evidence that he had any prior criminal record. The Court considered that the factors cited by the counsel for the defence in relation to the distribution of the stories. The sentencing guidelines were set out in R. v. Warn, 2005 ONCJ 417 (CanLII), 5.03 which authorizes the taking of samples from you for forensic DNA analysis.","[1] Mr. Houston pled guilty at the opening of trial to one count of
distributing child pornography, in the form of written works, between the 12th of
June and the 8th of August, 2005, contrary to s. 163.1(3) of the Criminal Code of
Canada. Mr. Houston was a high profile
contributor to the website during the time he was active, and he remains
unrepentant, meaning he does not yet believe there is anything wrong with writing
such stories, but simply agrees to stop doing so because the law requires it. [18] Based on the circumstances of this offence, and the circumstances
of the offender, I conclude that a conditional sentence would not be a fit sentence
on the facts in this matter, although I agree Mr. Houston qualifies for the same to
the extent a fit sentence would not exceed two years, and I agree on the limited
information available that he would not endanger the community if one were
imposed. A conditional sentence also would not be
strong enough to deter others who might be inclined to engage in the activity of
distributing child pornography. [19] I have taken into account the mitigating factors referred to by
counsel for the defence, such as the fact that Mr. Houston has no criminal record,
and did plead guilty, albeit at the opening of trial, along with the other material I
have referred to in the foregoing in arriving at what I consider to be the
appropriate length of sentence. Mr. Houston, I sentence you to 15 months
imprisonment, to be followed by a term of probation of three years, as well as the
additional orders I am about to make. Canada: (1) Pursuant to s. 490.012 of the Criminal Code, it is ordered you be
subject to an order which will issue in Form 52 requiring you to

The accused was active on a pedophile website and posted 11 stories describing sexual activity between men and infants and pre-teen girls. HELD: Accused received 15 months imprisonment followed by 3 years of probation with addition orders including providing DNA samples and being added to the Sex Offender Registry. The Court accepted that the internet has led to the accelerated proliferation of child pornography, making it an increasing social problem. The social harm of such material is borne almost exclusively by infants and children, the most defenceless members of society. For this reason, denunciation and deterrence are the dominant sentencing principles. The defence submitted that the writings do not actually harm children in their making and, therefore, should not be subject to the same denunciation as pornographic images. The Court rejected this argument because it cannot be assumed that the writings do not stimulate the demand for images and since not all pedophiles are voyeurs only some will act on their desires and anything that stimulates this desire places children at risk in the real world. Aggravating factors in this case were 1) the fact that the accused extolled pedophilia and wrote hard core child pornography and encouraged others to the same. 2) The accused was a high profile contributor to the web site and he remains unrepentant Ã» he does not believe there is anything wrong with writing these stories and only stopped because the law requires it. A conditional sentence would not represent sufficient denunciation or deterrence. Mitigating factors in this case included a lack of criminal record, the guilty plea and the fact that the accused is looking after his elderly mother.","The defendant pled guilty at the opening of trial to one count of distributing child pornography contrary to s. 163.1(3) of the Criminal Code. The defendant had 1,200 postings on his website, which included 11 stories that included 11 described sexual activity between adults and either infants or preteen girls. The moderator of the website encouraged stories, and the defendant encouraged others to submit stories. He stated he was more of a voyeur than actively sexual with girls. Although he claimed he did not know such stories were unlawful in Canada, he had been a frequent contributor to a website that promoted stories about sexual encounters with pre-teen girls, which on the scale of written child pornography places it in the upper half of the scale.HELD: The defendant was sentenced to 15 months imprisonment to be followed by a term of probation of 3 years as well as the additional sentences. The Court took into account the mitigating factors referred to by the defence, such as the fact that the defendant had no criminal record, did plead guilty, had no previous record, and was now serving the useful social purpose of looking after his ailing mother who lives on an isolated acreage and who will also be punished if he is incarcerated.","[1] Mr. Houston pled guilty at the opening of trial to one count of

Accordingly, and in the best interests of the administration of justice, there will be an order under ss.487(3)(a) in Form 5.04 for the taking of bodily samples from the respondent.",0.849673202614379

The accused was on duty in a marked police car when the accused's vehicle rolled forward and struck the complainant. The complainant crossed the road outside of the cross-walk and called for other police officers. At trial, the Crown called three witnesses and the accused admitted to driving the vehicle less than one-half-mile (1.8 km/hr) from where it had left the vehicle and then backed up to speak with the complainant before striking him. The defence suggested the accused had an oblique motive for thinking that the complainant was being insolent and returning to set him straight. The Crown argued the vehicle only moved a very short distance forward before striking the complainant, who was directly in front of the officer. The officer testified that he was on call at the time. Accused found not guilty of the charge. The second part of the Sault Ste. Marie test was whether the Crown has proved that the driving by the accused was careless. The Court held that the accused drove within a short distance of not more than one foot and not at a fast or accelerating speed. The offence was in effect careless driving, as distinguished from dangerous driving under the Criminal Code. The actions of the accused who could be considered careless were, first, the speed at which the vehicle passed by the complainant and then the complainant's vehicle. Second, the officer's evidence that he did not touch the accelerator, briefly took his foot off the brake, and then immediately reapplied the brake after seeing the plaintiff's vehicle move was accepted. There could be no other reason on the evidence presented for the officer to stop his vehicle but he did use a raised voice in speaking to his wife and that his voice was overheard by the officer as he asked whether the plaintiff required an ambulance and if so, whether the accused could have reasonably concluded that the plaintiff was in need of assistance. The court found that the officer did exercise due diligence and took reasonable care.","[1] Todd Tyndall is charged with driving without due care and attention at Yorkton, Saskatchewan on February 18, 2004, contrary to section 44(1) of the Highway Traffic Act.

The accused was on duty in a marked police car when the accused's vehicle rolled forward and hit the complainant. The complainant crossed the street outside of the cross-walk and called for other police officers. At trial, the Crown called three witnesses who testified that the accused was travelling very fast (over 25 km/h). The defence suggested the accused had an oblique motive for thinking that the complainant was being insolent and returning to set him straight. The Crown argued the accused should have simply continued driving. The officer testified that as he was leaving Super Store, he passed in front of a stopped vehicle, which turned out to be the defendant's vehicle. The defence then called four witnesses: Michael Rostotski, Corporal Pelzer, Constable Kinellson and Mr. Tyndall. They accepted that the vehicle only moved less than one foot, and didn't accelerate or move forward quickly. They also accepted that neither seat belt nor a raised voice in speaking to the officer was locked upon striking the accused. They both testified that their position in the vehicle was near the intersection where the collision occurred. The issue to be determined was whether the Crown has proved that the driving by the accused constituted carelessness applying an objective test in assessing carelessness and whether it has then shown on a balance of probabilities that it exercised due diligence in the context of the circumstances encountered. The actions of the accused which could be considered careless are, firstly, the speed at which the vehicle rolled past the complainant, and secondly, the manner in which it crossed the road. The second part of the Sault Ste. Marie test is whether the accused exercised due care or attention. HELD: The accused is guilty of the charge. 1) The officer's evidence that he did not touch the accelerator, not touching the brake, and rolled forward striking the complainant less than a short distance. This is insufficient to conclude that the actual speed of the vehicle is at most one foot. Given the nature of this confrontation and as an accident, it could not be concluded that the officer's vehicle moved too fast. The standard to be applied was set out by the Saskatchewan Court of Queen's Bench in R. v. Kozun 1997 CanLII 11313. The Court reviewed four areas where there was inconsistency and conflict in the evidence given by the Crown and defence witnesses.  2) The accused said he thought the defendant was going too fast when","[1] Todd Tyndall is charged with driving without due care and attention at Yorkton, Saskatchewan on February 18, 2004, contrary to section 44(1) of the Highway Traffic Act.

The respondent is 52 years old and unemployed. In the past, he has been diagnosed as paranoid schizophrenic and suffering from a personality disorder but is currently, according to his physician, of sound mind. He qualifies since 1987 for a disability pension under CPP by reason of his mental disability which provides for a basic income of $580 plus GTS rebate for a total of $630 per month. The petitioner lives on a section of farm land which was brought into the marriage by the respondent, of which one quarter contains the matrimonial home. The petitioner and children live in that home. The petitioner is 39 years old and is also unemployed because she is an incomplete quadriplegic. The farm land is rented out from which the petitioner receives rental income. The petitioner enjoys an income of $3,400 per month while the respondent receives $630 per month. HELD: The petitioner is ordered to pay the respondent the annual sum of $6,000 paid in monthly installments of $500. There is no juridical reason why the petitioner should obtain the total revenue owned by the respondent particularly when he brought the land into the marriage. In fact, fairness and equity would suggest just the opposite, at least in respect to one half of the revenue. Accordingly, the Court makes an order on the basis of the respondent's ownership of the land rather than order payment of spousal support.","FIAT. The parties were married in 1981 and ceased to cohabit in 1996. The respondent was diagnosed as paranoid schizophrenic and suffering from a personality disorder. In 1987 he qualified for a disability pension under the Canada Pension Plan by reason of his mental disability. He lived with a friend and paid no rent. In his financial statement the respondent set out a matrimonial property valued at $488,040. The difference in value relates to a section of land which the petitioner brought into the marriage. The petitioner and children resided in that home. HELD: Relief should be granted but in the circumstances it should not take the form of spousal support. The Federal Child Support Guidelines stipulate a payment of $442 per month. The CSSP benefits would not affect the welfare of the children. There was no requirement that the respondent live in a group home and there was no basis upon which he could order or expect such. As for the matter of luxurious living, the petitioner's expenses are inflated. There is a monthly payment on a bank loan which was obtained to purchase an RRSP and thereby reduce tax liability. The transaction was appropriate, but it must be remembered that there is an off-setting asset which could be sold and reduced loan payments would result. There are monthly expenses of $500 for legal fees. Finally, small economics could be achieved.

The court found with respect to each issue that the trial judge had not erred: 1) the defence had acknowledged the appellant had used force and that his spouse had not consented to it. Therefore the appellant could not argue on appeal that the trial judge failed to take implied consent into account. The trial judge was entitled to accept the spouse’s testimony as she was not cross-examined at trial. There was nothing in the transcript that showed the trial judge took a zero tolerance approach.

While the court has jurisdiction to hear human rights complaints, the jurisdiction only arises after the tribunal process has been exhausted. Since the tribunal procedure has not been completed, the portions of the statement of claim dealing with the human rights complaint are stayed on the basis that the underlying issues may only be heard by the court upon application of the Chief Commissioner of the Saskatchewan Human Rights Code pursuant to s. 29.6 of the Code. With respect to the claim that the defendant breached The Animal Protection Act, the essence of the claim is to seek damages against the plaintiff for the loss of the service dog. That portion of the claim must be struck because the plaintiffs cannot circumvent the provisions of The Animal Protection Act, 1999 nor eliminate the defendant’s right to be charged and tried in Provincial Court through the expediency of claiming a declaration in a civil suit. The third claim is that the defendant was negligent in allowing other children to interact with the service dog will not be struck because, assuming the facts in the pleadings are true, the claim for damages is viable. Likewise, the fourth claim that the defendant intentionally inflicted mental and emotional suffering on the autistic plaintiff will not be struck as is not plain and obvious from the pleadings that the claim cannot succeed. The plaintiffs’ application for an interlocutory injunction was dismissed because the claims that have not been struck are not rationally connected to the injunction, even assuming the remaining claims present a serious issue to be tried they do not justify a finding that the plaintiffs will suffer irreparable harm if the injunction is refused and the balance of convenience weighs in favour of not granting an injunction.","The plaintiffs are the five children of the Lawless family, who reside near Maryfield.

At the conclusion of the hearing, the application to dismiss the claim was reserved, while the application for an interlocutory injunction was dismissed with written reasons to follow. The parties consistently referred to the defendant as the 'CÉF'.

The CÉF had no authority to decide whether it would admit any non-Canadian children to attend a fransaskois school in Saskatchewan, and neither it nor the SHRC may inquire into its reasons or interfere with the exercise of its discretion.  1) The Court rejected the parents’ application to strike the statement of claim as an abuse of process.  2) There was no evidence that the parents obstructed or deliberately failed to comply with their obligations under s. 42.1 of The Education Act. The court found that it would be impossible for the plaintiffs to strike their claim for non-compliance with s. 25(1) of The Act. 3) The children were awarded provisional permission for the duration of the school year, subject to conditions including the granting of a service dog to the children. 4) The court awarded the plaintiffs general damages for out-of-pocket expenses, travel expenses, expenses, the cost of training and re-training of the service dog notwithstanding compensation that might otherwise be available in the amount of $100,000.","[71] For all of the above reasons, the plaintiffs’ claims for a declaration that the CÉF violated ss. 12(1) and 13(1) of the Code will be stayed on the basis that the underlying issues may only be heard by the court upon an application by the Chief Commissioner of the SHRC pursuant to s. 29.6 of the Code.

Even assuming that the remaining claims present a serious issue to be tried, they do not justify a finding that the plaintiffs will suffer irreparable harm if the injunction is refused. 3. The balance of convenience weighs against the granting of an interlocutory injunction. 1. The plaintiffs remaining claims are not rationally connected to the interlocutory injunction they seek.

They seek a declaration that the CÉF contravened s. 23.2(1) of The Animal Protection Act, 1999, by interfering with the use of a service animal. [86] I turn now to my specific reasons for dismissing the plaintiffs’ application for an interlocutory injunction ordering the CÉF to admit the plaintiffs to École de Bellegarde. 2. Even assuming that the remaining claims present a serious issue to be tried, they do not justify a finding that the plaintiffs will suffer irreparable harm if the injunction is refused. 3. The balance of convenience weighs against the granting of an interlocutory injunction. 1. The plaintiffs remaining claims are not rationally connected to the interlocutory injunction they seek. On the evidence before me, it would not be appropriate for an interim mandatory injunction to issue that would have the effect of immediately elevating the members of the Lawless family from non-rights holders to rights holders. CONCLUSION [95] With respect to the defendant’s application for an order striking out the plaintiffs’ claim:


1. The plaintiffs’ claims for a declaration that the CÉF has violated their rights under ss. 12(1) and 13(1) of The Saskatchewan Human Rights Code, both directly and as “collateral damage”, are stayed pending an application to the court pursuant to s. 29.6 of the Code. 2. The plaintiffs’ claim that the defendant has violated ss. 23.2(1) of The Animal Protection Act, 1999 is struck out. 4. The CÉF’s application for an order striking out the claim for damages arising from alleged “intentional infliction of emotional and mental suffering” on Trystan Lawless is dismissed;",0.471875,0.4339622641509434,"Civil Procedure Injunction HELD: The first portion of the statement of claim is an attempt by the plaintiff to have the Court take jurisdiction over a matter that is already before the Saskatchewan Human Rights Tribunal. While the court has jurisdiction to hear human rights complaints, the jurisdiction only arises after the tribunal process has been exhausted. Since the tribunal procedure has not been completed, the portions of the statement of claim dealing with the human rights complaint are stayed on the basis that the underlying issues may only be heard by the court upon application of the Chief Commissioner of the Saskatchewan Human Rights Code pursuant to s. 29.6 of the Code. With respect to the claim that the defendant breached The Animal Protection Act, the essence of the claim is to seek damages against the plaintiff for the loss of the service dog. That portion of the claim must be struck because the plaintiffs cannot circumvent the provisions of The Animal Protection Act, 1999 nor eliminate the defendant’s right to be charged and tried in Provincial Court through the expediency of claiming a declaration in a civil suit. The third claim is that the defendant was negligent in allowing other children to interact with the service dog will not be struck because, assuming the facts in the pleadings are true, the claim for damages is viable. Likewise, the fourth claim that the defendant intentionally inflicted mental and emotional suffering on the autistic plaintiff will not be struck as is not plain and obvious from the pleadings that the claim cannot succeed. The plaintiffs’ application for an interlocutory injunction was dismissed because the claims that have not been struck are not rationally connected to the injunction, even assuming the remaining claims present a serious issue to be tried they do not justify a finding that the plaintiffs will suffer irreparable harm if the injunction is refused and the balance of convenience weighs in favour of not granting an injunction.","The plaintiffs are the five children of the Lawless family, who reside near Maryfield. They attended a French language school, which was made possible by provisional permission granted to them by the defendant. In February 2013, the defendant informed the plaintiffs that their provisional permission to attend was not being extended for the 2013-2014 school year. At the conclusion of the hearing, the application to dismiss the claim was reserved, while the application for an interlocutory injunction was dismissed with written reasons to follow. The parties consistently referred to the defendant as the 'CÉF'. HELD: The Court found that the family’s decision to exclude the plaintiffs from the school was based entirely on the failure of the parents to live up to their commitments. The CÉF had no authority to decide whether it would admit any non-Canadian children to attend a fransaskois school in Saskatchewan, and neither it nor the SHRC may inquire into its reasons or interfere with the exercise of its discretion.  1) The Court rejected the parents’ application to strike the statement of claim as an abuse of process.  2) There was no evidence that the parents obstructed or deliberately failed to comply with their obligations under s. 42.1 of The Education Act.

The land developer applied for a declaration that the application was in fact complete and sought an order of mandamus directing the development officer to issue the final approval.[1] The applicant land developer sought to have the approval granted without meeting the newly incorporated road standards. The development officer found that because it received tentative approval before the new road standard was incorporated, its application should be grandparented and it should only have to meet the road standards as they existed at the time it received the approval. Certiorari granted on the basis of s. 283 of the Municipal Government Act (MGEA) and s. 250(3) of the by-law. The applicant argued that as a matter of law it had a right to have its final approval granted, without the higher road standards, because it relied on the grandparenting section of the MGEA. The municipality relied upon s. 278(1)(f) and (g) which provide for an application for subdivision approval if the proposed subdivision was in accordance with the enactments in effect, (again subject to a non-contentious error in the plan); the applicant was entitled to declaration that its application was complete. The Applicant was also entitled to a declaration on completion of the final subdivision plan. The application for final approval was to be received within two years of the date of the approval of the tentative plan. [2] The facts are neither complicated nor in dispute. The Application in the case at bar was submitted just within the two year mark. The right of appeal is from a refusal. It was a complete application subject to two requirements: (1) the failure to comply with the new roads standards and (2) the completion of one of the courses on a single lots; both of which appeared to be inconsequential. The second requirement was the very subject matter of this hearing. [3] Having ruled in the Applicant's favour on this issue, find therefore that all aspects of s 283 have been met and the Applicant would have been entitled to final approval, even if the Board were to hear this matter by way of appeal, it might not have been able to grant appropriate relief. The decision to declare the application incomplete was therefore set aside. On the same basis, the Applicant is entitled to declarations that the Application for Final subdivision plan approval is received within 2 years from the publication of the first notice advertising the council's intention to adopt or amend the subdivision by-laws.

2010skqb145.txt,"The parties were in a relationship for over 5 years though they never married. The petitioner now seeks access to the respondent's daughter from an earlier relationship. The parties' relationship was tumultuous and included some incidents of domestic violence, which the child may have been exposed to. There are concerns regarding the interactions between the respondent's daughter and the petitioner's own children. The petitioner must establish, firstly, that he has 'sufficient interest' to bring this application, per s. 6(1) of The Children's Law Act, 1997. HELD: The application for access is dismissed. In determining whether a non-family applicant is a person with a sufficient interest, the Court must consider a variety of factors including: the extent or degree of the applicant's involvement in the child's life, the duration of that involvement, the level of intimacy and the quality of the relationship between the applicant and the child, how the relationship between the applicant and the child was represented to the world, and whether the applicant provided financially for the child. The petitioner has demonstrated that he is a person of sufficient interest; the relationship between the parties was not short and, during its lifespan, the petitioner formed a close bond with the child and was involved with her life. The community viewed them generally as father and daughter. However, the Court cannot conclude that requiring the child to visit the petitioner would be of any benefit to her. This child has already had to contend with multiple 'fathers' and multiple 'siblings', many of whom have been only temporary or fleeting personalities in her life. The confusion that this has no doubt caused her should not be further compounded by requiring her to make even more adjustments in her understanding of what 'family' means. Access to the petitioner is not in the best interests of this child.","The parties were permanently separated. Now, the petitioner is seeking access to the respondent's daughter from an earlier relationship. That child is an 11 year old. HELD: 1) The respondent is a person of sufficient interest to the petitioner. He does not need to establish that he falls within the category of persons having a'sufficient interest' to bring this application. The Court reviewed the factors enumerated in s.2 of the Family Maintenance Act and found that 1) the respondent has demonstrated that he is a Person of sufficient Interest with respect to this child. 2) The petitioner has already had to contend with multiple fathers and multiple siblings. Many of whom have been only temporary or fleeting personalities in her life. The overriding consideration is the best interests of the child. The relationship spanned years 2000 to 2007. The petitioner provided care for the child, participated in activities with her and was involved with her two younger children. The respondent has previously shown himself to be ineffectual in attempting to harmonize the children of two families. However, the Court found that the petitioner's extended family consisted of her two elder half-brothers, who it would appear were no longer part of her life, and that access is not in the best interest of the petitioner to her. 3) The relationship between the respondent and the petitioner spanned time between the time of the separation of the parties. It is not surprising that the child is doing well in school and the respondent provided child care when the parties lived together. The fact that the respondent is the biological father does not even place him within the class of persons who could be said to have a sufficient interest under the Act. The father of two more children, who were of the same age as the petitioner, has a residence with the petitioner in the residence of the mother of the two children. It would appear that the relationship has spanned a period of time commencing when the petitioner was barely a toddler. Over the years the petitioner has provided care and assistance to the family and has been intermittently involved in their lives. 4) The Court concluded that the presumption that it is in the child's best interests that she have access to him is more consequence to the legal position that he has argued. Even though in other circumstances the respondent may be considered a person who has demonstrated a settled intention to treat the petitioner as his own child, that determination would not elevate him to status greater than that of person having sufficient interest in this proceeding. In this case the presumption lies with the presumption","The first that must be considered is the position taken by Lawrence that because he is a “step-parent” to Trista, he does not need to establish that he falls within the category of persons having a “sufficient interest” to bring this application.

The accused was charged with aggravated assault on the first complainant and common assault on the second complainant. None of the inmates testified at trial other than the accused. The accused testified that he felt he was being shunned in the Block and had received threats from the first complainant and others in the complainant's group who were brandishing shanks earlier that day. The defence argued that the Crown failed to prove that the injuries caused to the first complainant fell within the definition of 'wound, maim, disfigure or endanger life'; and that the acts done to the first and second complainants were in self-defence as contemplated by s. 34 of the Criminal Code. HELD: The accused was convicted of both counts. 1) In relation to the accused's defence of self-defence pursuant to s. 34(2) pertaining to the first complainant, the Court found the accused did not believe that he was being assaulted within the meaning of the law and, even if he did hold this belief, such a belief was not reasonable in the circumstances.

The accused admitted that he had other options but chose not to avail himself of them. 2) The Court found it did not need to assess the application of s. 37 of the Code in relation to the common assault charge. Rather, the Court found s. 27 of the Code applicable and determined that the second complainant was legally justified to use as much force as was reasonably necessary to prevent the commission of an offence which would be arrestable without warrant.

The Crown must establish the mental element; the mens rea requirement for aggravated assault is an objective foresight of bodily harm; and 4) that knives were involved in a joint assault, such that the victim was the recipient of some type of violence. The accused was acquitted of all three elements.","[1] The accused, Frederick Junior Knife (the “accused” or “Knife”), is charged with one count of aggravated assault and one count of common assault relating to a violent incident that took place in the maximum security unit of the Saskatchewan Penitentiary at approximately 8:30 p.m. on September 1, 2008.

1995canlii4465.txt,"The plaintiffs statement of claim was served on the defendant in Ontario two days after it was issued. Two weeks later the prothonotary issued default judgment for $8,000, plus $2,880 in interest and $404.42 in costs. The defendant applied, pursuant to Civil Procedure Rule 12.06, to set aside the default judgment, on the ground that the plaintiff did not meet the requirements for obtaining a default judgment from the prothonotary or, in the alternative, on the merits that it had, by affidavit evidence, raised triable issues and provided a reasonable excuse for its failure to file a defence. Dismissing the application with costs of $1,000 to the plaintiff, that although the plaintiff ought to have sought the court's leave to take default judgment such a procedural ommission did not, in the circumstances, prejudice the defendant. Further, while there were triable issues between the parties, the defendant's failure to file a defence was neither a mistake nor an oversight, but rather a deliberate decision so as not to attorn to Nova Scotia jurisdiction, and therefore was not a reasonable excuse.","The plaintiff was the successor corporation of an amalgamation company which included Sweeney Limited. The defendant entered into a letter arrangement with the plaintiff to represent its share of the plaintiff's energy savings. The plaintiff refused to defend and brought a motion to set aside the default judgment on the basis of forum non conveniens. The chambers judge found that the defendant had failed to establish any reasonable excuse for its failure to file a defence and, in this case, it was not a mistake or an oversight, as the plaintiff had clearly intended to avoid the jurisdiction of the Nova Scotia court and had in fact prepared and delivered a detailed analysis of the action in both Ontario and Nova Scotia. She concluded that there were a number of triable issues and the defendant was in no position to bring a defence in Ontario. Dismissing the application, that the defendants' default judgment was premature. It was obtained before the time limit for filing an application had expired. In other words, the defendant did not want to lose its present leverage which would allow the defendant to pursue the litigation in Ontario at considerable cost and inconvenience to the plaintiff, who is without any presence there.","By Interlocutory Notice filed March 2, 1995, the defendant applied, pursuant to Civil Procedure Rule 12.06, to set aside the default judgment.

The application was adjourned to June 2, 1998 for show cause hearing. On that date the matter was set over to February 11, 1997 for election. In that motion, defence counsel advised the Court that he was objecting to the prosecutor continuing as prosecutor because he wished to bring an application to have him removed. The Crown argued that at no point during the way did it waive the delay and the delay of approximately 7 months which resulted from its desire to have a ruling made on the conflict of interest alleged was solely attributable to the Crown. Defence counsel took the position the opposition by Mr. Kohlenberg to defence counsel's request was prompted by good faith and was not without merit. It is not known whether the actions of the accused caused the delay or if the reasons for the delay were the same. HELD: Application dismissed. 1)It is not for the court to decide how the motion would have been decided had it proceeded.

The delay was caused by the absence of proper preliminary procedures and strategy. There was no evidence that any ruling made by the preliminary inquiry judge would be restricted to the conduct of the proceeding at preliminary inquiry (s.537(i) C.C.C.) and could not extend to a trial judge following any committal. 4)The Court was not able to determine if the delay was unreasonable or caused by any of the factors listed in the Morin analysis.

The main issue relates to how the proceeds of sale of property by judicial listing should be applied against a mortgage balance when there are both purchase money and non-purchase money balances. The issue on appeal revolves around s. 2 of the LCRA. The LCRA states that the right of a lender to recover the unpaid balance of a mortgage securing the purchase price of farmland is restricted to the land to which the mortgage or agreement relates as well as to any collateral security including a security of interest. The portion of the loan attributable to the purchase of the land is 64.03% ($96,900.00) and is credited against the purchase money portion. The balance owed by the appellants fell into default and the respondent commenced foreclosure proceedings. At that time the balance owed had grown to $536,186.72. The property was sold through judicial listing orders and the net sale proceeds were paid to the respondent. However, these proceeds were not sufficient to satisfy the loan. The respondent then sought an order entitling it to the deficiency judgment. Hrynewich Holdings was the controlling authority with respect to the portion owing to the mortgage. The appellant was awarded judgment in the amount of $162,675.99 against the mortgage balance. The appeal was allowed in part on the basis that the judge pro-rated the calculation pursuant to the percentage owing on both the purchase and nonpurchase funds. The court reviewed the cases and found that s. 25 of the Saskatchewan Farm Security Act should be interpreted liberally thereby permitting the sale proceeds ($372,444.01) to be applied to the purchaser money portion first or in the alternative, the proceeds should be distributed between the two portions on pro rata basis. HELD: Appeal allowed.  1) The conclusion in Andrew (CA) would not have been made had the court considered it in its entirety.  2) The Court found that the appellant respects the spirit and intent of The Land Contracts (Actions) Act and is the correct interpretation to be placed on that provision. In addition, the Court accords with the policy behind the legislation as set out in this judgment.","Appeal allowed [5] There are two issues to determine: a) how should the proceeds of the sale be applied against the mortgage balance, and b) what is the proper amount of the deficiency judgment?

The loan was a consolidation of existing debt, part of which was the balance of $373,089 owed on the original loan that had enabled the appellants to purchase the land. The remaining $87,711 was non-purchase money financing approved by the respondent. The appellants fell into default, and the respondent commenced foreclosure proceedings when the balance owed had increased to $536,186. The property was sold through judicial listing orders and the net sale proceeds were paid to the respondent. As the proceeds were insufficient, the respondent sought an order entitling it to the deficiency. The Chambers judge considered s. 2 of The Limitation of Civil Rights Act (LCRA) and held that the amount of the deficiency should be $162,675.99. The issues on appeal were how the proceeds of sale should be applied against the mortgage balance and what the proper amount of the deficiency was. HELD: The appeal was allowed. The court reviewed the purpose and policy behind the LCRA. It then examined its conflicting decisions in Hrynewich Holdings and Andrews and held that the latter was a per incuriam judgment and therefore not binding and the approach set out in Hrynewich would guide the disposition of this appeal. Therefore, it found with respect to each issue that the holding in Hrynewich meant that payments should be allocated on a pro-rated basis to purchase money and non-purchase money debt balances and the proper amount of the deficiency to which the respondent was entitled to judgment against the appellants was $31,160.23.","HELD: The appeal was allowed and the respondent was entitled to take out a deficiency judgment in the amount of $162,675.99. The court found that the proceeds of sale of property by judicial listing should be applied against the mortgage balance when there are both purchase money and non-purchase money balances. The Chambers judge considered s.2 of the LCRA and held that the amount owed to the respondent should be reduced to $164,550. The amount owing to the mortgagee was $536,186.72. In Andrew (CA), the court found the portion of the loan attributable to the purchase of the land was 64.03% ($93,700.72) and that the remaining $87,711.00 (1,000,000 of the purchase money balance) was not sufficient to satisfy the loan. The respondent sought an order entitling it to the deficiency. The LCRA is not binding and the reasons in Hrynewich Holdings should guide the disposition of this appeal.","Appeal allowed [5] There are two issues to determine: a) how should the proceeds of the sale be applied against the mortgage balance, and b) what is the proper amount of the deficiency judgment?

The petitioner now earned an annual salary of $115,500.00. The Agreement did not address the level of child support in accordance with the Federal Child Support Guidelines, nor did it provide for practical retaining by the Respondent to facilitate employment. This was an exceptional situation that required some adjustment to the Agreement reached by the parties. The court ordered the establishment of a retraining fund of $6,500.00 with direct payments to whatever institution the Respondent may choose. Limited spousal support was to terminate on the earlier of completion of the retraining allowance or transfer of the balance of the outstanding to the Respondent on September 1st, 2001.

In his proposed employment, the petitioner indicated that she wished to confer term insurance or some other benefit upon her spouse. No date for this application was given. HELD: The petitioner's income for the purposes of child support is fixed at $6,875.00 per month and the Corollary Relief Judgment will be issued within 60 days or thereafter at the present rate for two children of $1,409.07. Pursuant to the terms of the parties' agreement, there was no obligation on the respondent to pay any more than $850 per month for medical and other benefits separate from the post-tax deductions for long term disabilities and the respondent was to retain life insurance for benefits that are substantially provided in Canada through general taxation, indirect taxation and consumption taxation. There would not be any jurisdiction remaining open for the court to make a limited realistic adjustment to the Agreement.","[20] The Agreement did not address the level of child support in accordance with the Federal Child Support Guidelines in effect, nor did it provide a limited capacity or practical retraining by Mrs. Clarke to facilitate employment.

Although there is no direct evidence as to the financial requirement that is probably necessary for retraining, the parties do not wish any further delay and I have simply drawn upon experience in concluding that a lump sum non-taxable retraining allowance in the amount of $6,500.00 should be made available by Mr. Clarke for this purpose. In the meantime, commencing the month of April he shall pay $500.00 per month towards the arrears and in the month of August the outstanding balance of his obligation shall take priority from the sale proceeds of his stock option after setting aside what is reasonably required by way of capital gains tax and the trust fund for Mrs. Clarke’s retraining allowance.",0.3837471783295711,0.43846153846153846,"The parties were married for 14 years and separated in 1995, entering into a detailed Separation Agreement in 1998. The two children of the marriage are 16 and 8 years of age. There was a long history of relatively short terms of employment and several moves to take employment. The respondent had a grade 12 education and some university courses but no practical skills or training. For the past 3 years, the respondent had made no reasonable efforts for employment, developed no skills of a practical nature, and derived her income from child support payments and the Child Tax Credit and by incurring debt in excess of $20,000.00 The parties had entered bankruptcy during the course of the marriage and had no assets or savings or pension entitlement at the time of separation or acquired since.

The wife has no independent legal advice as to whether or not this should be adjusted for all or part of the direct income tax obligation incurred on the $6,000.00 taxable benefit. HELD: 1)The parties had never had any financial stability in part because they far too readily accessed credit based on future expectations of capacity that never been realized and they would be wise to cease utilization of credit for short term relief. Doing so in the long run imperils the ability to provide properly for the children. The court found that this was an exceptional situation that required some adjustment. 2)The wife was to have access to $8,000 in the U.S. for the duration of the marriage. She should be advised of the particulars of that account.  3)The husband was to pay $4,800 per month for medical and other benefits separate from the post-tax deductions for long term disabilities, $5,000 per month in rent, $1,800 for holidays with his sons and $83.00 for a five-month period in Bahrain.

In view of the past abuses the defendants shall not be entitled to any conduct money for the initial attendances at the examinations or for any subsequent attendances required for the completion of the examinations. 4)The plaintiff was awarded costs of the applications in any event of the cause.","The plaintiff applies to strike the statement of defence of the corporate defendant, Great Canadian Bingo Corp.

[43] Therefore, the petitioner will have judgment against the respondent for the sum of $113,155.19 less the sum of $15,580.00 (being the value of the assets in her possession) leaving a balance of $97,575.19 to be paid to the petitioner, less one-half the costs of the appraisals.

Matrimonial property was to be divided, maintenance for the children and spousal support were to be determined. HELD: 1)Access was to be mutually agreed upon with the 18 year old to whom the respondent stood in loco parentis.  2)Expert evidence of tax implications was not called as the respondent failed to give notice as required by the Rules of Court. 3)The mother's annual income for purposes of the Guidelines was fixed at $11,376 not including the $300 child support she received from the natural father of the 18 year old. The respondent's farming income was determined on a 3 year average as it varied from year to year. The facts justified adding back 25% of the capital cost allowance on the machinery over the last 3 years for Guideline purposes. Day care and play school costs of $440 per month were to be divided according to their proportionate share based on the Guidelines. The respondent was to pay one-half of the cost of extra curricular activities and any future activities as agreed upon. The approach used in Cook v. Kilduff was adopted and the amount for the two natural children was deducted from the amount payable for three children. One-half of the difference was added to the Guideline amount of support for the two children. 4)Spousal support was not ordered. The mother was employed and the respondent's income was not likely to increase in the near future. Given he paid child support and the extra costs, their income was nearly the same. 5)Of the six quarter sections owned by the respondent prior to marriage, there was no equity in one and the increase in value in the others was marginal. Credit was given for the reduction in the mortgage debt by $24,000. There was no interest to be divided in the 1999 crops. 6)The petitioner was awarded judgment for $113,155.19 less $15,580 for assets in her possession and less one-half the appraisal costs. The judgment was to be a charge on the respondent's land. The petitioner may apply for judgment for the amount of the loan secured by the van in her possession if the respondent fails to pay off the loan. 7)Each was to pay his or her own costs.","Divorce, custody and access were disposed of by judgments given during the course of the trial by consent of the parties. The petitioner was awarded judgment for $113,155.19 less the sum of $15,580.19 that was to be paid to the petitioner in their respective percentage based on the Guidelines. The respondent was to pay one-half of the cost of extra-curricular activities set forth on Exhibits P-9, P-10 and P-ll as well as one half of the maintenance for the children. The court declined to order any spousal support as it was assumed the respondent's income would increase in the near future. Given the fact that after the respondent pays child support (including the extra costs) the income of the respondent and that of the petitioner will be nearly the same, it is agreed the respondent stands in loco parentis in respect of Randy. The Court ordered that $24,000 must be added to the value of the matrimonial property as the net increase in equity in the six quarters.HELD: 1)The petitioner was to have judgment against the respondent in the amount of $111,155., less half the costs of the appraisals. The judgment shall be a charge on his personal land.  2)The respondent's annual income of $1,000,000 was reduced by $400 per month to $400.00. She also paid $40 per month for play school. The total costs of $440 for the two children were to be taken and added to be the total payable for the three children. 3)Spousal Support was declined as there were no costs awarded to either party and each must pay their own costs.","[1] This issues for resolution in this trial are:
