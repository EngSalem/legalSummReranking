She commenced the action against the respondent with the consent of the Workers' Compensation Board. The trial judge held the action barred pursuant to the act. Dismissing the appeal, that s. 18 of the Act bars actions against any employer to which Part I of the Act applies. It is not necessary that the employer be the appellant's employer.","This was an appeal from a decision of the Supreme Court which held that the action herein was barred by s.18 of the Workers' Compensation Act. The appellant was employed by MacKenzies Eastern Transport Limited. She was struck by a tile which fell from the ceiling of the warehouse owned by the respondent. The respondent was the employer of the appellant. She commenced an action against the appellant for damages. Dismissing the appeal, that the ban is against the actions of \'an employer\', not \'his employer\' and would appear to extend the ban to all employers to which Part I of the Act applies."
d_2005nssc322.txt,"The plaintiff, who was injured in a rear-end motor vehicle accident, applied for summary judgment and an interim payment of damages. Application for summary judgment granted; application for interim payment dismissed. There was no 'air of reality' to the defendant's defence; whether or not the plaintiff's brake lights were working, to strike her vehicle from behind on these facts meant that the defendant was either travelling too close or didn't have enough care and control of his vehicle. The plaintiff was making a significant claim for damages but she suffered from numerous previous injuries and conditions relating to her health; any damage assessment would depend largely upon credibility and the medical evidence at trial; to assess interim damages in this case would be a most difficult task and would only be a haphazard guess. The plaintiff's claim was also complicated by the fact that it could possibly be subject to the 'minor injury' cap on damages.","This was an application for an order for summary judgment pursuant to Rule 33.01 and an interim payment under Civil Procedure Rule 31.01. The plaintiff was operating her motor vehicle and said in her affidavit that she was struck from behind by one of the Defendants named in the action. Defence counsel for the plaintiff argued that there was a significant amount of other factors relating to the health of the plaintiff, including her prior conditions which contributed in significant way to her current health problems. Application allowed; costs of this appeal and application before Judge Burke to be set aside as to liability with damages to be assessed."
e_2017skqb219.txt,"HELD: The court found the following with respect to each issue: 1) the grandmother was a person of sufficient interest regarding the children pursuant to s. 6 of The Children’s Law Act, 1997 and had standing to bring her application for custody; 2) it would be in the best interests of the children, now aged ten and nine years of age, to have their primary residence with their grandmother as she was their psychological parent. They had resided with their grandmother for most of their lives and it was important to maintain their relationships with their school and friends. The respondent would have regular weekly parenting time with the children; and 3) the evidence was inadequate to consider child support.","The third party in this matter is the maternal grandmother of the two children, Gage and Haydn, born September 18, 2006 and May 1, 2008. The respondent is the biological father of the children. HELD: 1) The proper focus of an inquiry in relation to the “sufficient interest” question is the nature of the relationship between the applicant and the child. The question of the child’s best interests does not enter the analysis at that point. In determining whether a non-family applicant is person with sufficient interest, the court should consider a variety of factors including, but not necessarily limited to, the extent or degree of the applicant's involvement with the child, the duration of that involvement, (c) the level of intimacy and quality of relationships between the child and the mother, (d) whether the applicant provided financially for the child; and (e) whether there was a settled commitment to the child by the applicant. The father was to have access every second weekend from Friday to Sunday evening for the next four years. 2) The grandmother is the person of sufficient interest with respect to the children and her home is the primary residence of the parties. She is willing to provide the father with parenting time with the children if the grandmother is successful in her request for primary care."
c_1999skqb60.txt,"The plaintiff lawyer commenced an action for fees and disbursements in the amount of $4,647.85. The proposed garnishee, SPMC, paid $337.46 into court and brought an application for an order pursuant to Rules 411 and 415(1) of the Queen's Bench Rules of Court. An order that any further amounts due and owing from SPMC to the company be paid into court to be disposed as directed by the court was granted with taxed costs to SPMC. Labour Standards filed notice of potential wage claims. The plaintiff obtained default judgment and made an ex parte application for payment out of the monies paid into court by SPMC. HELD: The applicant/plaintiff was to be paid all monies paid into court by SPMC with respect to the two files together with accrued interest less the amount previously paid out. The claim by the Minister of Labour was dismissed. Although the monies paid into court according to the decision in Polyco Window Manufacturing Ltd v. Prudential Assurance Co create a fund from which creditors must be paid, the claim by the Minister of Labour as of the date of the application was not a proven claim. No certificate had been issued and no judgment had been entered as of that date. A judgment had been filed by the plaintiff.

1993canlii3448.txt,"The applicant sought an order for certiorari quashing a decision of the trial judge granting an adjournment and a prohibition from hearing the trial. In earlier hearings, the Crown and applicant had each sought new trial dates to ensure procurement of witnesses for trial. The Crown sought to subpoena the victim to testify. Due to the delay in obtaining authority to serve an out of town subpoena in New Brunswick, the Crown was unable to serve the victim until three days before trial. The victim did not learn of the trial date until the day before and was unable to attend. An adjournment was granted. The applicant contended the trial judge had exceeded his jurisdiction. Dismissing the application. It is within the jurisdiction of the trial judge to deal with the issue of adjournments in accordance with the provisions of the Criminal Code. Jurisdictional error is not to be equated with error of law. Any decision to grant an adjournment is therefore within the court's proper discretion. If a remedy exists, it is by way of an appeal and not a prerogative writ. In any event, the sequence of events was sufficient to justify the granting of an adjournment. There was neither neglect nor laches on the part of the Crown.","The applicant sought an order of prohibition and certiorari directing that Judge Archibald and any other provincial court judge cannot hear the trial of the Queen v. Joseph Glenn Jessome. HELD: The application was dismissed. 1)It is within the jurisdiction of the trial judge to deal with the issue of adjournments in accordance with the relevant sections of the Code. 2)Any decision in that regard was an exercise of his discretion within that authority. He had the right to exercise the discretion and right to be wrong. If there is any remedy, it is by way of appeal.  3)The decision as to whether or not to grant an adjournment was within his jurisdiction. The decision was within that jurisdiction. It was not necessary to say that the decision was wrong on the first ground. There was no controversy as to the events leading up to the witness not being available at the date of trial."
d_2005nsca104.txt,"The son of unmarried parents, who had graduated from high school, was working part-time, living with his mother and had not made a final decision on a further course of study sustained a serious brain injury just a few months after his 19th birthday. He required extensive rehabilitation and would not regain his pre-accident physical and intellectual capacity. The mother successfully applied for a reinstatement of child support which had been discontinued by consent, pre-accident, when the son was residing with the father. The son, now 23 years old, was upgrading his high school marks at the time of the hearing and hoped to be admitted to a community college program. The father appealed. Appeal dismissed; the judge's decision to award support was not premised upon a finding that, pre-accident, the son had made a clear decision to pursue a further course of study but on the fact that the son intended to pursue his education and had not withdrawn from parental charge at the time of the accident. There was no evidence to support the allegation that the usual Guideline amount was 'inappropriate' in this case; the Act prohibited the consideration of public income assistance when fixing child support; given the uncertainty about the son's future, this was not an appropriate case for a time-limited order.","This was an appeal from an order made pursuant to the Maintenance and Custody Act requiring the appellant father to pay child support for his son who was a dependent child. The respondent was a high school student who had recently graduated from high school and was pursuing a post-secondary education. The appellant father was ordered to pay maintenance of $500 monthly, commencing June 5th, 1996. He was abusing drugs and alcohol which was of concern to both parents. The court found that the appellant had not withdrawn and was unable to withdraw from the parent's charge at the time of the accident. The child had made arrangements to take a paralegal course at the Nova Scotia Community College commencing in September 2004. Although the appellant's only source of income was Provincial Income Assistance in the monthly amount of $667, the fact that he returned to school to improve his marks is confirmation that he intended to further his education.

5_1998canlii13955.txt,"An application pursuant to s197 of the Automobile Accident Insurance Act for an order setting aside SGI's termination of the applicant's income replacement benefits. The applicant suffered soft tissue injuries to his cervical spine when his vehicle was struck from behind by an uninsured driver. He received a partial income replacement benefit from SGI on the basis he was not able to perform some but not all of his farm duties. HELD: 1)SGI was not entitled to terminate Sawkiw's benefits pursuant to s185(d), (e), (f) or (g). SGI's failure to make a suitable rehabilitation program available to Sawkiw prior to October 1/97 and its failure to reassess his level of income replacement benefits as at September 14 where significant factors contributing to his desperate circumstances. SGI was requiring Sawkiw to attend daily physiotherapy of 3 to 4 hours duration with approximately 2-1/2 hours of additional travel time. It is common knowledge that pain can be exhausting; that daily physiotherapy can be exhausting; that daily travel of 2-1/2 hours can be exhausting; that the physical demands of farming can be exhausting; and, that the mental demands of managing a farm and coordinating and organizing the work of others on a farm can be exhausting. It was far from clear how SGI expected Sawkiw to devote approximately 6 to7 hours per day to his treatment program and still have the mental and physical reserves to devote any time or energy to his farming oprations. He could only reasonably be expected to participate in daily physiotherapy if he was receiving a full, rather than a partial income replacement benefit. 2)The benefits were properly terminated pursuant to s129(1)(e) the first day of his full time employment in Alberta. However, from September 14/97 to the date of termination Sawkiw was entitled to be paid full income replacement benefit without adjustment for a partial return to work. Sawkiw was entitled to the difference and interest from the date such additional benefits should have been paid until the date of this judgment. 3)SGI was to arrange for an assessment by the rehabilitation centre forthwith. If it is found that as a result of the accident Sawkiw is not able to hold the employment he held at the time of the accident, SGI is encouraged to consider his condition as a relapse under s142(1)(a). Under the terms of this judgment the final income replacement benefit will be other than one made pursuant to s139 or 140. 4)Sawkiw was entitled to his solicitor and client costs respecting services rendered and disbursements incurred from the date of filing his notice of motion to the date this judgment is received. He was also entitled to his costs associated with preparing and filing his notice of motion set at $600 being the maximum amount payable under the Personal Injury Benefits Regulations.",The respondent Saskatchewan Government Insurance applied to the court pursuant to s. 197 of the Act for an order setting aside the termination of benefits. HELD: The application was dismissed. The court found that SGI was not entitled to terminate the benefits of a farmer on the basis that he was not able to perform some but not all of his farm duties. The only issue was whether or not Sawkiw had a valid reason for his failures.
9_2006skca114.txt,"This is an application for leave to appeal, and leave being granted, an appeal by the Crown from a sentence imposed against a young offender pursuant to the Youth Criminal Justice Act. The respondent pled guilty to a charge of robbery, an offence contrary to s. 344(b) of the Criminal Code. The respondent was sentenced to 90 days secure custody, 45 days community supervision, 1 year probation and a 10 year firearms prohibition. HELD: Appeal allowed orally. The sentence is set aside and a sentence of 12 months closed custody, 6 months community supervision, 1 year probation and a 10 year firearms prohibition was imposed in addition to the 90 days closed custody already served at the time of the appeal.  1) It was clear that the primary concern of the sentencing judge was that, in the wake of the Supreme Court of Canada decision in R. v. B.W.P.; R. v. B.V.N. 2006 SCC 27, a custodial sentence might not be open to him at all. It is the Court's view that the sentencing judge's conclusion that the decision in B.W.P. virtually ruled out custodial sentences for young persons under the Youth Criminal Justice Act was unwarranted. The gist of that decision is that under the Act the principle of general deterrence is not a factor to be taken into account and cannot be used to justify a sentence harsher than the circumstances of the offender and the offence would warrant. Nor is specific deterrence to be considered as a separate factor. 2) It is the Court's view that a long custodial sentence is necessary to accomplish the task of bringing the seriousness of the offence to the respondent's attention, and provide meaningful consequences to reinforce societal values without negatively affecting the respondent's likelihood of rehabilitation.","This was an application for leave to appeal and, leave being granted, an appeal by the Crown from a sentence imposed against a young offender pursuant to the Youth Criminal Justice Act. The sentence was set aside and a sentence of 12 months closed custody, 6 months community supervision, 1 year probation and a 10 year firearms prohibition was imposed in addition to the 90 days closed custody already served at the time of the appeal. HELD: The sentence imposed was demonstrably unfit, failing to take into account the seriousness of the offence, the culpability of the offender, the criminal history and other circumstances of the respondent, and his need for psychological and substance abuse counseling and further education."
b_1996canlii5028.txt,"Guardian was the general liability insurer for Kellogg. Royal was the primary insurer as holder of Kellogg's blanket fleet coverage. Kellogg's employee was involved in a motor vehicle accident while on company business but was driving his wife's vehicle at the time of the accident. Royal denied coverage and refused to defend on the basis of an exclusionary provision regarding the use of substitute automobiles. It was held at trial that Royal was not obligated to participate. HELD: 1)The case law reveals some inconsistencies with respect to the relationship between the duty to defend and the coverage provided by the policy. Where the policy clearly does not provide coverage, the insurer had no duty to defend. Where a policy only provides coverage for some allegations the insurer is only obligated to defend those allegations which may trigger the obligation to indemnify. When a policy is ambiguous some courts have adopted Thames and have stated the mere possibility that the policy may provide coverage is sufficient to oblige the insurer to defend. 2)Section 209 provides no guidelines as to the scope of the inquiry the judge may engage in. The chamber judge did not define the scope of his inquiry and stated that the standard suggestion that Guardian must raise an arguable point was 'off target'. To determine whether an insurer has the obligation to defend a chamber judge must examine the coverage provided by the policy. The judge made no finding of ambiguity in the exclusionary provision. He simply determined the Honda was not covered by the Royal policy and did not decide the issue of indemnity. 3)The affidavit evidence indicated that the parties lived in the same premises thus that argument was without merit. CONCURRING JUDGMENT: The appeal was dismissed for different reasons.  1)There has been an acceptance of the general concept that the duty to defend is broader than the duty to indemnify. To order an insurer to defend a chamber judge need be less sure the policy provides coverage than would be the case for an actual determination of liability under the policy. 2)There was a factual element which could not be determined on this application such as whether a partially deflated tire constitutes a breakdown within the meaning of the policy and whether the automobile the employee was driving was owned by someone living in the same dwelling. 3)The question centered around the words used in clause 5 of the policy and who it referred to. There were inconsistencies in terminology. The policy should not be interpreted as though the restriction it contains on what automobile can be used as a temporary substitute should be ignored.","This was an appeal from an application for directions to determine whether Royal had an obligation to defend. The appellant was the primary insurer as the holder of the blanket fleet coverage of the respondent Kellogg. The respondent, Royal, agreed it had a duty to defend but submitted it had an exclusionary provision in its policy. The chambers judge found that Royal was not obligated to defend because the Honda involved was not insured by Royal. The issue to be resolved on appeal was whether the chambers judge erred in his application of the principles of contract interpretation when he decided the Honda was not a 'temporary substitute automobile' within the terms of the policy. HELD: 1)The chambers judge did not define the scope of his inquiry. He simply said in response to Guardian's argument it merely must raise an arguable point that the standard suggestion by Guardian was 'off target'. 2)An examination of the duty to defence in light of the Nichols decision would appear to be beneficial."
d_1993canlii6612.txt,"On appeal from 106 SaskR 277. 47 year old respondent, former President and Chief Executive Officer of STC, had been awarded $165,000 (18 months) for wrongful dismissal. He had successively served three Crown Corporations over a period of ten years. On appeal held the award of damages was not inordinately high. The court however reduced the damages by $16,500 as it disagreed with the trial judge's determination regarding mitigation of damages. Appeal allowed to the extent of reducing the damages from $165,000 to $148,500.","This was an appeal from an assessment of damages in a wrongful dismissal action brought against Saskatchewan Transportation Company by Leo Larsen, its former president and chief executive officer. For the most part we can find no tenable basis for concluding that the award of damages was inordinately high. The trial judge assessed the damages on the general principles, first, that the object of these awards is to compensate for the loss of income sustained in consequence of the wrongful dismissal; second, that their measure is prima facie the amount that would have been earned had the employment continued subject to deduction of such amounts as in the ensuing months are either earned or should be earned in light of the duty upon persons suffering losses to keep them to minimum. The salary was calculated on the premise his annual salary was $102,000, not $110,000. He resisted the attribution on pragmatic grounds arguing that the company had not paid him any salary; that there was no guarantee the company was going to earn profit; that it needed working capital; and so on. Awarding the sum of $165,000 to Larsen for the purpose of mitigating his loss was unreasonable."
3_2000canlii19612.txt,"The plaintiffs claim for crop damage caused by the defendant's cattle entering the plaintiff's canola field. The defendant denies he is responsible or negligent, but admits his cattle were in the field.HELD: Damages were awarded in the amount of $2,533.45. The court valued the loss at $3,052.36. It then deducted 2% attributed to wild animal damage, 5% for the plaintiffs failure to calculate actual yield from the rest of the crop, 5% that the plaintiffs would have paid in dockage and 5% for the cost of production. Civil liability for crop damage caused by cattle flows from the Stray Animals Act. A cattle owner is strictly liable for damages caused by his straying cattle.  This liability may possibly even be absolute and only an act of god may serve as a defence. The issue here is the quantum of the damage. The fact that the defendant was refused access to the plaintiff's property to repair the fence has no bearing on liability in this case. An independent adjuster assessed the damage at 557 bushels. The court found on the facts that the damage was caused exclusively by the defendant's cattle on several occasions.","The plaintiff's claim against the defendant was for crop damage sustained as a result of his cattle getting into the plaintiff's canola field late July, 1999. The plaintiff admitted that his cattle were in the plaintiff’s crop on one occasion, but denied liability. HELD: The plaintiff was awarded judgment in the amount of $2,533.45 plus pre-judgment interest from January 2000 and costs. 1)Under both the present and pre-1977 statutes, the cattle owner is strictly liable for damage caused by his cattle. The fact remains that the cattle did not move into the plaintiffs’ canola on more than one occasion and that other cattle were not in the field. 2)Under the present s.27 (1) and (2) of the Stray Animals Act, the legal situation was the same. The cattle owner was strictly liable to his cattle for crop damages caused by them. The Carrot River did not prove to be an impediment on this occasion. There was no evidence credibly suggesting that water levels would have hindered the cattle on earlier occasions, any more that it might have hindered them on the day they were seen by Mr. Korpach in the canola. It is mere supposition that other neighbours’ cattle were here during the relevant period. Given the knowledge that neighbours have of each other in rural Saskatchewan, it would be expected that the defendant would have placed before the court some evidence supportive of his supposition. 3)The plaintiff was entitled to give opinion evidence with respect to crop damage and assessment of crop damage."
2_2007skqb337.txt,"The appellant appeals his conviction of dangerous driving. The police did not see the appellant driving; they came across his minivan immersed in a slough in excess of 35 feet off the highway. Based on the tire tracks, the appellant was charged with dangerous driving. The trial judge concluded that the circumstantial evidence presented by the Crown was consistent with the appellant's guilt and the circumstantial evidence was inconsistent with any other rational conclusion. The appellant argues that without expert evidence called by the Crown to prove it was not possible for the appellant to have swerved in the manner he testified to create the same physical evidence shown in the photographs, the Crown has failed to prove that the appellant drove through the stop sign. In other words, the trial judge could not simply rely on his own experience to find that the appellant could not have been able to manoeuvre the minivan in the way he described. HELD: Because the Crown's evidence was not the only rational conclusion to be drawn by the trier of fact, the Crown has failed to prove the case beyond a reasonable doubt. While no accident reconstructionist was available to check the accident scene after the incident, the Crown could have called an expert to testify whether the defence's theory could hypothetically be rational. However, no expert was called. The appeal is allowed and the conviction set aside.","The appellant appeals his conviction of dangerous driving. The learned trial judge concluded that the circumstantial evidence presented by the Crown was consistent with the appellant's guilt and the circumstanial evidence was inconsistent with any other rational conclusion. It was the defence's theory at trial, and Fleury's unwavering statement that Fleury was travelling south on Highway #2 at the point of the 'T' intersection and swerved to miss deer that had come onto the highway. Fleury argued that, without expert evidence called by the police to prove that it was not possible for Fleury to have swerved in such a manner to create the same physical evidence shown in the photographs, the Crown has failed to prove the accused drove through the stop sign on Highway 11.

2010skqb145.txt,"The parties were in a relationship for over 5 years though they never married. The petitioner now seeks access to the respondent's daughter from an earlier relationship. The parties' relationship was tumultuous and included some incidents of domestic violence, which the child may have been exposed to. There are concerns regarding the interactions between the respondent's daughter and the petitioner's own children. The petitioner must establish, firstly, that he has 'sufficient interest' to bring this application, per s. 6(1) of The Children's Law Act, 1997. HELD: The application for access is dismissed. In determining whether a non-family applicant is a person with a sufficient interest, the Court must consider a variety of factors including: the extent or degree of the applicant's involvement in the child's life, the duration of that involvement, the level of intimacy and the quality of the relationship between the applicant and the child, how the relationship between the applicant and the child was represented to the world, and whether the applicant provided financially for the child. The petitioner has demonstrated that he is a person of sufficient interest; the relationship between the parties was not short and, during its lifespan, the petitioner formed a close bond with the child and was involved with her life. The community viewed them generally as father and daughter. However, the Court cannot conclude that requiring the child to visit the petitioner would be of any benefit to her. This child has already had to contend with multiple 'fathers' and multiple 'siblings', many of whom have been only temporary or fleeting personalities in her life. The confusion that this has no doubt caused her should not be further compounded by requiring her to make even more adjustments in her understanding of what 'family' means. Access to the petitioner is not in the best interests of this child.","This was an application by a non-family member to obtain access to a child from an earlier relationship. HELD: The Court found that the applicant was a person of sufficient interest in the circumstances of this case. 1) The applicant had not proven that he was in the best interests of the child. The Court had previously determined that access should be granted to the applicant because the child had a close 'child-parent' relationship with the respondent and that he stood 'in the place of parent' to her. 2) The Court held that it was not in the applicant's best interests to have access to the child given that the respondent had been convicted of assaulting and threatening his mother. Separations and disruptions in the family were the norm. The child had been introduced to a series of 'daddies' while she was living with her mother and her father, who had been incarcerated for sexually assaulting her. 3) There was no presumption that access between the applicant and the respondent was in her best interests. It was indisputable that the relationship between the parties was one of mutual interest. 4) The court was not satisfied that the application was of more consequence to the legal position that he had argued."

The mother was the successful party and income was imputed by the court to the respondent.  Held, costs in the amount of $3,000 are awarded against the father. The father's position caused unnecessary time, effort and delay. The court referenced L. (N.D.) v. L. (M.S.) (2010) to summarize the principles and case law relevant to determining a cost award under Rule 77. Determining costs in a matrimonial manner is more complex given mixed outcomes and the burden of costs placed on families and children such that the court may need to exercise discretion and move away from a strict application on tariffs.","This was a costs decision. The parties litigated the apportionment of custody and access rights and the quantification of child support and special expenses for their two children.

HELD: The appeal from the decision of the Committee was allowed with costs as usual and there was an order directing the board to hear and determine the company's appeal. 1)Wascana Energy exercised its right to appeal properly or effectively. The wording of the subsection empowers persons to give notice to, as distinct from requiring them to serve notice upon, the administrator. This is less formal expression suggesting less exacting term. Moreover, it is an Act of such commonplace application as to strongly suggest notice might be given by registered mail, applying as it does to almost everyone in every corner of the rural areas of the Province, and falling within the reach of local people with no special training, except for the administrators, to be able to determine an appeal by this date. 2)The phrase'may give notice in writing' must be taken by implication to allow for notice to be given in the most obvious way, which is to say by simply handing it to the administrator at the board. The board is required by sittings to hear the appeal in keeping with the requirements of the enactment. The administrator is bound on timely receipt of such notice to act upon it, if by timely receipt was understood to mean receipt in sufficient time to enable them to perform their duties. Nor did any other form of prejudice arise.  3)The wording of s. 303(1) of The Rural Municipality Act, 1989, S.S. 1989-90, c. R-26.1 does not specify how notice may be given. In other words, some steps in exercise of the right in this case had been taken before the expiration of the period, including the mailing of the notice. As might have been expected, nothing turned on the fact that the notice did not arrive within the prescribed time, for the administrator and board were still able to act on it in accordance with the statute. 4)The appeal could only be entertained by means of registered mail within 20 days of the mailing or publication of the assessment. This would add a distinctly undesirable measure of individual uncertainty. 5)It is the date of August 1st of each year that drives the several time requirements."
e_2012skca69.txt,"The applicant applied for judicial interim release under s. 20(b) of the Extradition Act and s. 679 of the Criminal Code. Romania sought extradition of the applicant so that he might serve a 3 year prison sentence imposed as a result of a conviction in Romania for criminally negligent homicide with respect to a motor vehicle collision where the accused, while impaired, hit a pedestrian and killed him. The applicant offered surety from the Romania community in Saskatchewan who did not appear to have known the accused for long and offered to put up his car as bond. The applicant had common law spouse in Saskatchewan but owned no real property. HELD: Although the Crown conceded that the applicant had met the relatively low threshold of showing that his application for leave to appeal his extradition order was not frivolous, the Court of Appeal declined to release the applicant. The Court of Appeal held that there is an elevated risk of flight in light of the fact that the applicant has exhausted all appeals in Romania and is facing a 3 year prison sentence. Canada's international obligations in extradition proceedings require the Court to look more severely at the risk of non-appearance than it would if the application was made solely under s. 679 in respect of criminal proceeding in Canada. The sureties offered by the applicant were not sufficient to ensure his attendance at Court. The application for judicial interim release was dismissed.","The applicant applied for judicial interim release pursuant to s. 20(b) of the Extradition Act and s. 679 of the Criminal Code. The applicant had been detained by Canadian authorities for 7 weeks during which time he made a claim for refugee protection pursuant to the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act. In April 2004, a Romanian court increased the non-custodial portion of his sentence to three years imprisonment and increased the probationary term to five years. In December 2004, an appellate court in Romania converted the sentence to 3 years imprisonment. He then relocated to Saskatoon, Sask., on the strength of $5,000 cash and a surety bond. He was later apprehended and he admitted consuming alcohol and striking the victim. He is now subject to a court order to pay damages to the deceased's estate with which he has not, but presumably could have, complied even though he has resided in Canada for the past eight years. HELD: The application was dismissed.  1)The applicant's status as a Convention refugee and Canada's obligations under the Convention with respect to non-refoulement do not displace the limiting effect of its legal obligations under international extradition treaties on a level of acceptable risk under the s.679(3)(b) test.  2)The application was made in the context of a review by the Minister under s. 40 of the Act. The Crown concedes that the applicant has met this low threshold. It is not my place to look behind that status on an application of this nature.  3)While the applicant’s application before the Minister was for judicial release, the application before this Court was for interim release and did not engage those legal obligations. 4)The risk of non-appearance is such that it cannot be mitigated by release conditions which, on the materials before the Court at this juncture, he might be able to meet."
e_2001skqb128.txt,"The mother had custody of the 12 and year olds under the terms of the January 10, 2000 consent judgment. The father applied to vary child support in November on the basis of his reduced income. HELD: The application was dismissed with costs to the petitioner fixed at $1,000. The onus is on the applicant to provide cogent, independent or objective verification of change of circumstances. This application was brought 10 months after the pre-trial conference. It was of no consequence that someone may come into the home rather than using commercial day care service. There was no change in the father's hours of work or the schedule. The only change was that the mother was no longer available to provide care during Saturday of his access weekends. The mother was not to schedule activities during the father's access periods without his consent and he was to provide 7 days written notice if he chooses not to exercise access during specified times. This was not a variation of the custody/access regime but rather specific directions to provide some predictability for the children.","The parties agreed to vary the child support provisions of the consent judgment, including his contribution to child care expenses as well as access provisions. The consent judgment provided that the parties shall have access to the children at all reasonable times including the following: 1) On alternate weekends from Friday evening until Sunday evening at 8:30 p.m., to be extended to Monday evening in the event of a long weekend; and 2) On a weekend when the children no longer attended institutional daycare, the respondent was to provide seven days written notice to the petitioner. The parties agreed upon child support in a total amount of $1,000 per month, not based upon his reported income but rather what she describes as his true income. However, irrespective of whether there are other child care services available to the respondent, the fact is that there has been no change in the circumstances of the children. There is no material change in his circumstances. This application was brought just ten months after the pre-trial conference. The material did not satisfy the Court there had been any material change. It was not necessary to determine which of these two alternate approaches constitutes the basis of a consent judgment as the material question before the Court at this time is the same in both instances."

The corporations have been very profitable and the retained earnings of both companies far exceed the amount of long term debt. HELD: 1) The respondent has deemed additional income of $50,000 and $27,200 from the two companies. 2) The imputed annual income of the respondent is $150,000. 3) Costs in the amount of $750 to the petitioner.","The issue was the amount of child maintenance payable by the respondent to the petitioner for the benefit of Brady Melvin, born January 9, 1993.

At issue was whether s5.3 of the Trade Union Act authorized the Board to make such an order. HELD: The appeal was dismissed with costs.  1)The Board recognized the question to be a jurisdictional question. The standard of review is whether the decision was correct rather than patently unreasonable. 2)The chambers judge arrived at the correct conclusion whether from the point of view of the plain meaning of the words of s5.3 or the context of the entire statute or a purposive approach.  3)S5.3 refers to the 'board' which is defined by s2(c) to be the LRB and accordingly referred to applications and orders of the LRB. The interim power is not only based on the final power but is also part of the final power and both are part of the same process. 4)S25(1), when read with ss(1.1) and (1.2) indicates an intention on the part of the legislators to grant exclusive jurisdiction to arbitration boards to deal with disputes arising out of the interpretation of collective agreements. 5)Whatever the scope of s42, it cannot be used to release the restrictions of a statutory provision the very purpose of which is to define the jurisdiction of the LRB to act in respect of such matters.","This was an appeal from an order which quashed an interim order of the Labour Relations Board pending the determination of a grievance by an arbitration board, even though no proceedings were pending before the Board and even though it had no power to make any final order respecting the proceedings before the arbitration board.

b_1995canlii6024.txt,"The accuseds were charged under ss.300 and 301 of the Code with (i)committing and (ii)publishing a defamatory libel against a police officer. They filed a plea of justification as permitted under s.611(1) of the Code. The Crown denied the truth of the plea pursuant to s.611(4) and the matter proceeded to trial. At the opening of their trial the accuseds applied for an order declaring ss.300 and 301 of the Criminal Code to be of no force and effect on the basis that they constituted an unreasonable limitation on their rights and freedoms guaranteed under ss.2, 7 and 11 of the Charter. The Crown admitted that ss.300 and 301 limited an individual's right to freedom of expression as provided by s.2 of the Charter but argued that this infringement was justified under s.1 of the Charter. HELD: Application allowed in part.  1)The onus of justifying the limitation of a right or freedom is on the party seeking to uphold the limitation and the standard of proof is by a preponderance of probability. 2)The standards against which a limit on a right or freedom guaranteed by the Charter can be shown to be reasonable and demonstrably justified are those underlying values and principles essential to a free and democratic society. While the right of free speech is important in our society, it is not unrestricted. 3)In order to justify an infringement of this right, it must be shown that: (i)the impugned legislative provision has an objective of pressing and substantial concern and (ii)there is a proportionality to the legislation in that: (a)the measures must be fair and not arbitrary, carefully designed to achieve the objective in question and rationally connected to the objective; (b)the means should impair freedom of expression as little as possible; (c)there must be a proportionality between the effects of the limiting legislation and the objective. S.300 of the Code meets these tests, and is therefore a reasonable limit on free speech and is valid. 4)Ss.611 and 612 of the Code, which permit a plea of justification do not create a reverse onus on the accused. They are procedural and merely serve to put the Crown on notice as to the accused's defence. The Crown must still prove that the alleged defamatory libel is knowingly false beyond a reasonable doubt. 5)S.301 of the Code makes it an offence to publish a defamatory libel whether or not the accused believes it to be true. S.301 is therefore not a reasonable limit and is invalid. ADDENDUM: The Court ordered that the agreed statement of facts set out at pp. 2 and 3 of the judgment not be published nor broadcast in any manner.","The applicants apply for a declaration that s. 300 of the Criminal Code constitutes an unreasonable limitation of one or more of the rights and freedoms guaranteed by s. 2(b) of the Charter and by reason of the vagueness and uncertainty of the offence. HELD: The application for relief is dismissed. 1)Defamatory libel is a matter published without lawful justification or excuse that is likely to injure the reputation of any person by exposing him to hatred, contempt or ridicule or that is designed to insult the police officer knowing that the matter published was false and did thereby commit an offence contrary to s.300 of the Code. 2)Section 298, 299 and 300 constitute a limit prescribed by law within s.2(b). The emphasis of the passage, as Wien recognised in Goldsmith Pressdram Ltd, is on the character of the language used. The Actus reus elements of the s. 301 offence are publication of false statement that is defamatory. The mens rea elements of s. 309 and 311 are not relevant to this charge."

There was a no contact order in place pending the outcome of domestic violence charges against the father (who had not seen the child for four months). The mother had nothing positive to say about him. They disagreed about the extent of his marijuana use, and the extent of his involvement with the child. He agreed to abstain from drugs around the child and for 12 hours before access. The mother expressed concern the father was a flight risk because he was from Egypt and had family support outside the country. Sole custody to the mother, with supervised access for a period of time (to reintroduce the father to the child), moving to increasingly longer periods of daytime access. The father must complete a parenting course to better learn how to meet the child's various needs. There was insufficient evidence to show he is unable to protect the child from her severe nut allergy. There was insufficient evidence to establish he is a flight risk. Even if he had threatened to flee with the child, it is relevant that he lacks the means to do so. While there has been unpleasantness and some violence between the parties, the evidence does not establish domestic violence of a nature that would require supervised access on an ongoing basis.",The Father was to attend a course in parenting such as those offered by Family SOS so that he would be informed about child development and understand how to appropriately parent the child. The Mother was to seek supervised access. The Father was not to be under the influence of marijuana. HELD: 1) The Court found that the Father had not interfered with the child's well-being. 2) The evidence was inconclusive and as result the Mother had not proven these allegations on the necessary balance of probabilities. 3) The Father's access was to be supervised for two to three hours per week. 4) The court found that there was no evidence that the father had physically or verbally abused the child or that he was inattentive to her safety. 5) The father's parenting skills were inadequate and he would need training prior to caring for the child unsupervised.

In this role, the Provincial Court judge is exercising a quasi judicial function. Counsel for the plaintiff has clearly indicated that the claim is a test case. The plaintiff seeks declaratory relief. A substantial amount of the claim involves an allegation of breach of contract, but neither the plaintiff nor the proposed defendants were signatories to the contract. Accordingly, they would not be entitled to the benefit of the agreement. As virtually all of the potential issues raised by these claims are declaratory in nature, they are outside the jurisdiction of the Provincial Court. Any litigation over these issues must be done in the Court of Queen's Bench.","The court declined to issue summonses as requested. The issues raised by these claims were important issues to the potential plaintiffs and may well be worth litigating, but that litigation, in this case, must be done in the Court of Queen’s Bench, by either issuing a new claim or by way of enforcement proceedings of the claim upon which the agreement referenced above was made.

8_2001nssc179.txt,"The defendant obtained a tender to bank, blend and load coal at the plaintiff's coal preparation plant. In performing the contract, the defendant experienced equipment problems resulting in the plaintiff having to rent equipment from the defendant's predecessor.

The defendant counter-claimed for damages arising out of the termination of the contract, for services performed under the contract and for extras which had not been paid. Plaintiff entitled to reimbursement for overpayments and equipment rentals; defendant entitled to fair and reasonable compensation for extras for which court awarded the sum of $10,000. Both parties were in breach of the contract, the plaintiff's breach occurring because the volumes of coal supplied did not approximate the tonnages represented in the contractual documents. The clause excluding liability for errors in the forecast did not excuse the plaintiff because the actual volumes were not even approximate to the forecasted tonnages and the rates bid by the defendant were directly related to the anticipated tonnages. Absent evidence as to how the plaintiff arrived at the information used in the calculation of the forecasted tonnages, no negligent misrepresentation could be found, as there was no evidence that the information was negligently obtained.

HELD: The contract was awarded. The court found that in an earlier invitation for tender issued in 1985 there was a different wording in respect to the contract, submitting that the contract was not being used as being the contract between the parties and that the relevant figures for purposes of considering the estimates made by the parties were those in the purchase order. The plaintiff was awarded the contract by the issuance of a purchase order incorporating the terms and conditions contained in the specifications rather than the figure set out in the original order. It chose not to follow this option.  1) The court was unable to agree on the final figure as the plaintiff was not entitled to any reimbursement for the costs of the operation of the lifting and blending centre. 2) There was no ambiguity as to the wording in the contract or in the wording between the original invitation and the 1985 invitation for tenders. It was not possible for the court to determine the exact amount of money advanced to the plaintiff. 3) The plaintiff's options were to reject the contract as not being in conformity with the terms, specifications and specifications of the original tender and to cancel the contract without prior notice.

The Town of Martensville disputes that such instructions were given and that, in any event, the cause of the pipes bursting was not as result of the water not being turned off but rather because the plaintiff had the power and heat disconnected. HELD: The action was dismissed. There was no order as to costs. 1)The plaintiff's action could not succeed for the following reasons: the Court cannot find on the evidence that clear instruction were given to the plaintiff to disconnect the water service. To the contrary, the form executed by the plaintiff clearly indicates request for final billing. The evidence demonstrates a misunderstanding at best between what the plaintiff believed she was requesting and what in fact she did instruct. This cannot be construed as negligence in the circumstances by the town nor does the fact that specific forms are now utilized for disconnect purposes elevate the matter on the facts before the Court, to negligence by the Town.  2)The Court could not find a clear instruction was given or obtained on the back of the form.

The defence took the position that she was now telling the truth; that the statement was improperly obtained in breach of the confession rules of voluntariness and the statement did not meet the requirements set out in R. v. K.G.B. HELD: The witness' prior statement may be introduced in evidence for the substantive truth of its contents. It will be for the jury to decide what, if any, portions of such statement they wish to accept. 1)A prior inconsistent statement cannot be introduced in evidence for its substantive content, unless the requirement of necessity, and a threshold of reliability arrived at on a balance of probabilities are established. When, as here, a witness recants, the requirement of necessity is established. The real issue is whether the prior statement meets the test for reliability. When, as here, there is only one demonstrably false piece of testimony in the statement, which does not implicate anyone but rather attempts to exonerate someone, the Court was not prepared to say ipso facto the statement is unreliable. 2)The independent evidence sufficiently corroborated her statement in enough different particulars that, but for the demonstrably false portion, it met the threshold of reliability.","FIAT: The Crown applies to have the witness declared adverse pursuant to s. 9 of the Canada Evidence Act on the basis that in the course of giving her evidence, she has demonstrated ahostile attitude towards the position of the Crown, and hascontradicted in a substantial way, her prior video-taped statement to police officers made shortly after her arrest.

The petitioner takes issue with the respondent's unilateral reduction in child support and submits the children remained children within the meaning of the Divorce Act so long as they were attending university.

The parties also agree Keegan is 18 and remains a child of the marriage by virtue of the fact that he is taking classes at the university. 2) While the respondent asks that he be allowed to pay child support directly to the children, there is nothing in the material filed which would indicate that the petitioner is not providing support to the child in an appropriate fashion. Further, the difficulties that would arise in respect to enforcement of the order if the child support payments were not made directly to the petitioner would mitigate against such a variation.","FIAT The respondent filed an application for a varying child support order granted by Justice Dielschneider. The relief sought was as follows: (a) declaration that the parties were no longer children of the marriage within the meaning of the Divorce Act; (b) an order eliminating the applicant's child support arrears as at the time of the application in the amount of $17,400; (c) an Order that any maintenance for Keegan be paid directly to the respondent; and (d) if the applicant is not providing support to Keegan in an appropriate fashion, the Guideline amount payable by the respondent is $380 per month plus 33% of all s. expenses. HELD: The application for child support was adjourned until November 1, 2008 at which time Luke's situation will be further examined to determine whether he is appropriate. 1) The parties agreed that given the age of the children and the change in the income of the parties, that there has been a change in circumstances sufficient to allow a review of the existing Child Support order. 2) There was no order as to costs."
e_2011skqb444.txt,"In the evening, the accused inmate and his two co-accused inmates placed themselves in close proximity to the complainant inmate at table at the Penitentiary. The co-accused threw hot liquid from the cup directly into the complainant's face and the three inmates commenced stabbing the complainant with weapon. second complainant inmate attempted to intervene to assist the first complainant and the accused and co-accused began to stab the second complainant. The first complainant suffered severe first and second degree burns to his face and to his shoulders as well as numerous puncture wounds and lacerations but was not critically injured. The accused was charged with aggravated assault on the first complainant and common assault on the second complainant. None of the inmates testified at trial other than the accused. The accused testified that he felt he was being shunned in the Block and had received threats from the first complainant and others in the complainant's group who were brandishing shanks earlier that day. The defence argued that the Crown failed to prove that the injuries caused to the first complainant fell within the definition of 'wound, maim, disfigure or endanger life'; and that the acts done to the first and second complainants were in self-defence as contemplated by s. 34 of the Criminal Code. HELD: The accused was convicted of both counts. 1) In relation to the accused's defence of self-defence pursuant to s. 34(2) pertaining to the first complainant, the Court found the accused did not believe that he was being assaulted within the meaning of the law and, even if he did hold this belief, such a belief was not reasonable in the circumstances. Further, the Court did not accept, on a subjective or objective basis, that the accused reasonably believed that the first complainant had the present ability to carry out the threat, notwithstanding that the physical aspect of the assault need not be imminent or immediate. Lastly, the Court found that the accused did not believe that he had no other option. The accused admitted that he had other options but chose not to avail himself of them. 2) The Court found it did not need to assess the application of s. 37 of the Code in relation to the common assault charge. Rather, the Court found s. 27 of the Code applicable and determined that the second complainant was legally justified to use as much force as was reasonably necessary to prevent the commission of an offence which would be arrestable without warrant. The Court found the second complainant was clothed in legal justification and the accused was not entitled to the protection of s. 34(1) because the accused provoked the assault, and the force he used was more than necessary to defend himself as the accused was armed with a shank and the second complainant was not.","The accused was charged with aggravated assault and one count of common assault relating to a violent incident that took place in the maximum security unit of the prison. The accused and two alleged victims were inmates at the prison and were being held on 'B' Block. Given that the incident was captured by two security videos, there is no doubt as to what happened. The issues raised by the accused pertain to how his actions ought to be characterized. HELD: The accused was found not guilty of aggravated assault. 1)The accused's actions against the victim were done in self-defence as contemplated by s. 34(2) of the Criminal Code. It is not legally necessary to distinguish and isolate the specific acts of Knife from the acts of the other joint participants for the purpose of determining which acts caused which injuries. In all of the circumstances, the Crown has established beyond reasonable doubt that bodily harm to Dorion was objectively foreseeable by him as a probable consequence to the plot to which he was a party. 2)There was no issue as to identity as the accused was wearing a distinctive jacket during the altercation. The Crown must also establish the mental element. The mens rea requirement for aggravated assault is an objective foresight of bodily harm. 3)The Crown was not required to establish that the accused caused death or grievous bodily harm but rather that he reasonably believed that he could not otherwise preserve himself from death or bodily harm at the hands of Dorion."
9_1994canlii4844.txt,"This decision is supplementary to [1993]TWL QB93506. Applications to further divide matrimonial property and to vary spousal maintenance. The husband had declared personal bankruptcy since the date of the original orders obtained under the Matrimonial Property Act and Divorce Act. HELD: 1)The husband's obligation to pay maintenance was reduced to $1 per month and the arrears accruing after the date of his assignment into bankruptcy were cancelled.  2)The wife's counsel requested that the court value and divide all of the matrimonial property equally notwithstanding the bankruptcy, because she might pursue a constructive trust claim for her 1/2 share as against the husband's trustee. 3)The court valued all of the matrimonial property and determined that 56% of this value should be paid to the wife, and only 44% to the husband, given amounts he had spent since the separation.  4)The court left unresolved the issue of which matrimonial assets might be exempt under the Bankruptcy Act and therefore available to the wife.","Division of matrimonial property. The petitioner did not take up farming and his subsequent decision to assign into bankruptcy made the calculation of what each party hopes to recover from the marriage assets problematic at best. HELD: 1)The petitioner did pay the respondent $2,300 by way of maintenance out of the proceeds of certain barley he sold privately. The respondent claims this was in violation of my original order prohibiting the sale of any assets of the marriage without consent of the other party or the Court. 2)Division based on the values indicated by the evidence. The wife was entitled to the following set-off to be included in her share of the Matrimonial Property division: (1)The respondent did not pursue livestock operation on the farm for a number of reasons, one of which being the fact that he required surgery on his back making it impossible for him to physically do the work. In any event he paid one half of the net proceeds to his wife which covered the division of the property. In addition the petitioner filed a motion seeking a variation of the previous maintenance order made in November in light of his bankrupt financial situation and his inability to earn any income at this time. 3)The parties equity in Saskatchewan Wheat Pool and grain on hand would normally go to satisfy the unsecured creditors of the respondent under his bankruptcy. As a result of the bankruptcy it is simply not possible to determine at this point in time how much either of the parties can hope to recover. 4)The husband's claim for set off should be allowed. There is no doubt the petitioner used assets to pay his legal fees. The parties should be granted the same privilege."
3_2002skca102.txt,"The accused applied for a stay of proceedings on the ground the Crown failed to provide adequate disclosure. In making disclosure, the Crown appended a copy of the respondent's criminal record to its affidavit. The defence then applied for a stay on the ground of perception of bias on the part of the Provincial Court judge because the respondent's criminal record was before her. The Crown appealed the order which prohibited the judge from continuing as trial judge in respect to the respondent's criminal charges of impaired driving, driving with blood alcohol levels exceeding .08, and dangerous driving. HELD: The appeal was allowed. The order for prohibition was quashed and the matter was remitted to the Provincial Court for trial. There is abundant authority that disclosure of an accused's criminal record to the court alone does not amount to an automatic disqualification of the court on the ground of apprehended bias, appearance of bias or other prejudice to the accused. The judgment in R. v. Peters is almost directly on point. The judge in this case said she had not read the record, she was not biased as a result of the information tendered at the pre-trial proceedings and the record was something she could put out of her mind as she did in all instances where she ruled evidence inadmissible. She was correct in these circumstances to dismiss the application for a stay and to decline to recluse herself.","This was an appeal from an order by a Queen's Bench judge prohibiting McMurtry P.C.J. from continuing as trial judge in respect of criminal charges against the respondent. HELD: The appeal was allowed, the order for prohibition was quashed and the matter was remitted to the Provincial Court for trial. The respondent applied for a stay of proceedings on the ground of perception of bias on the part of the judge because the respondent's criminal record was before her. The Crown had filed an affidavit to show that disclosure had been made. The affidavit had appended as exhibits the items disclosed by the Crown, among others, a copy of the criminal record. The application was dismissed. The court found that the Crown did not have to disclose to the trial judge any indication of criminal record and that the appeal must be allowed."

Further, the defendant had a duty to use a reasonable standard of care in the operation of the hazardous tree removal program. The defendant was negligent in failing to train the inspector properly. The Court referred at length to the Supreme Court of Canada decision in Just v. British Columbia. The defendant's claim against the third parties (owners/occupiers of property on which tree stood) was dismissed.","The plaintiff was in good health and driving his half ton truck on a public highway near Falmouth. A tree fell on his truck, crushing him inside the cab. He was now a paraplegic. The plaintiff sued the defendants, the owners of the property and the defendants' third party, alleging negligence. Allowing the application, that the plaintiff's action against the defendants was discontinued because the defendants did not consent to the discontinuation of the action against them.

2_2005skpc38.txt,"The accused is charged with driving without due care and attention contrary to s. 44(1) of the Highway Traffic Act. A pedestrian was crossing a road adjacent to a parking lot and, while walking directly in front of a stopped vehicle, was struck by the vehicle when it rolled forward. HELD: The accused is not guilty. The court accepted the accused's evidence that his vehicle rolled forward only a short distance of not more than one foot and not at a fast or accelerated speed and that the pedestrian was crossing outside of the cross walk and that the accused applied his brakes as soon as he saw the pedestrian. The accused did exercise due diligence.","The accused was charged with driving without due care and attention contrary to s. 44(1) of the Highway Traffic Act. The offence was in effect careless driving, as distinguished from dangerous driving under the Criminal Code. HELD: The accused was found not guilty of the charge. 1) The accused's vehicle rolled forward only a short distance of not more than one foot, and not at a fast or accelerating speed. The officer immediately applied his brake when he saw the accused and immediately took steps both to assist and to have other officers attend at the scene. The accused did swear at the officer and threatened to sue him and cause him to be fired from his employment. The Crown did not prove state of mind and the accused did not demonstrate due diligence. The Court reviewed four areas where there was inconsistency and conflict in the evidence given by Crown and defence witnesses. The first issue was whether the accused exercised due diligence applying an objective test in assessing carelessness. The actions of the accused which could be considered careless are, firstly, the speed at which he drove past Super Store, and secondly, his driving forward into Mr. Kuchar. This is understandable given that the accused was crossing the street outside of the cross-walk when he was struck by the vehicle. However, given the situation the accused found himself in, he could not have reasonably anticipated that a person would have been so close in front of him and that the officer did exercise due diligence both before and after striking the accused. The second issue is whether the Crown has proved the driving was careless. Based on the evidence presented, the accused's actions in operating his vehicle on the road beside Super Store constituted driving without a due diligence test. The trial judge found that the Crown could not reasonably have reasonably expected that a vehicle would have passed by where the complainant was standing, heard someone they later determined to be Mr. Banga holler, and then reversed to his position to find out what his concern was. The court found that there could be no other reason for the officer to stop his vehicle, other than the fact that he was on call at the time of the accident, and that he did not have time to respond to the officer's questions about whether he could assist the complainant or if he should have backed up to speak with the officer. In addition, there was no evidence the accused had an oblique motive for doing so, perhaps thinking that the defendant was being insolent and returning to set him straight."

The applicants sought an order quashing the warrant on the grounds that the search warrant was unlawfully and invalidly issued in excess of the jurisdiction of the Respondent. HELD: The application was dismissed. 1)The respondent, acting judicially, could be satisfied that the information contained in the Information was not disclosed to the applicants as it did not disclose the existence of reasonable and probable grounds to believe that the items sought to be seized would be found at the location of the search. 2)The Information was deficient in the following respects: (a)the sole ground upon which the Information is based is hearsay information from a confidential source and no details are provided in support of the informant's opinion or conclusion that such information is reliable; and (b)the informant failed to pledge on oath as to his belief in the accuracy of the source of confidential information and therefore no reliance could have been placed thereon in determining whether reasonable grounds existed for the issuance of the warrant."
d_2009skqb70.txt,"At issue is the amount of Income Replacement Benefits (IRB) payable to the appellant by SGI. The parties agree that the calculation of the IRB as provided by s. 117 of the Act is the annualized sum of $28,889.75. The appellant takes issue with SGI's reduction of the amount determined in accordance with s. 117 of the Act by calculating the appellant's net income in accordance with s. 135 to s. 138 of the Act. HELD: SGI has correctly calculated the appellant's IRB when it made the requisite deductions as set out in s. 137 to find the appellant's net income, and then reduced the net income to 90% to determine his IRB. It would be neither a rational nor fair interpretation to reduce a full-time earner's IRB by 90% and not the other types of earners. It would be neither a rational nor fair interpretation to deduct income tax, employment insurance premiums and Canada Pension contributions from only full-time earners. All earners are subject to these payments being deducted from their income but for their inability to earn an income because of an automobile accident. The further deductions to obtain the non- earner's IRB are in keeping with his earning reality.","The hearing judge determined that the income replacement benefit (the IRB) for Montgrand as a non-earner as defined by the Automobile Accident Insurance Act was not to be less than the IRB calculated for the first 180 days after the accident, as determined pursuant to s. 117 of the Act. However, the hearing judge raised no concern with respect to the 'weighted average approach' used by SGI in calculating Montgrand's IRB when it made the requisite deductions as set out in s. 137 to find the victim's net income, and then reduced the benefit to 90% to determine his IRB. Montgrand appealed SGI's calculation of interest on monies owed to him on the basis of pre-judgment interest. HELD: 1) The hearing judge erred in holding that SGI had correctly calculated Montgrand’s IRB, and reduced it to 90%. It would be neither a rational nor fair interpretation to deduct income tax, employment insurance premiums and Canada Pension contributions from only full-time earners, and not the other types of earners. The IRB is not less than 90% of the amount received pursuant to the original legislation. Ensuring that interest payable pursuant to Part VIII of the legislation is not reduced is in keeping with the purpose of its purpose. It strives for one's earning reality. Non-earners in the past may well become someone whose employment income, but for an automobile accident, would be more than the amount of an IRB that reflects his earning reality, poor past record ought not to preclude the claimant from an employment that reflects that reality. 2) SGI was correctly calculating the victim”s income for the post 180 day period. SGI did not raise any concern with the weighting average approach employed by the company beyond advancing an interpretation that was inconsistent with the legislation. As a result, there is no true lis regarding the efficacy of using SGI’S “weighting average” approach to calculate the net income of an individual as defined in the Act and the Regulations, particularly s. 24(1) thereof."

The respondent's farming income was determined on a 3 year average as it varied from year to year. The facts justified adding back 25% of the capital cost allowance on the machinery over the last 3 years for Guideline purposes. Day care and play school costs of $440 per month were to be divided according to their proportionate share based on the Guidelines. The respondent was to pay one-half of the cost of extra curricular activities and any future activities as agreed upon. The approach used in Cook v.

1998canlii3382.txt,"The appellant employer and the respondent union are parties to a collective agreement with effect from January 1, 1994 to December 31, 1996. The collective agreement established employee salaries for that period, with annual adjustments on January 1st of each year. Shortly before the agreement was signed, the Public Sector Compensation Act was passed, which rolled back and froze public sector salaries. In a letter to the union, the employer confirmed the wage increases provided for in the agreement would be paid to the employees as a lump sum following the expiration of the legislated wage freeze. After the expiration of the wage freeze, however, the employer refused to pay the lump sum on the grounds that it would contravene the Act. The union sued the employer in the Supreme Court, claiming the lump sum or, in the alternative, damages for negligent misrepresentation. The employer applied to strike the Statement of Claim on the grounds that the union's claims were within the exclusive jurisdiction of an arbitrator. The Chambers judge dismissed the application.

Where there is a doubt about the arbitrability of a dispute, that issue should generally be determined at arbitration.

There is no juridical reason why the petitioner should obtain the total revenue owned by the respondent particularly when he brought the land into the marriage. In fact, fairness and equity would suggest just the opposite, at least in respect to one half of the revenue. Accordingly, the Court makes an order on the basis of the respondent's ownership of the land rather than order payment of spousal support.","FIAT. The respondent sought an order for interim spousal support. HELD: The court found that relief should be granted but in the circumstances it should not take the form of spousa support. The petitioner did not have the means to make the indicated payments. The court ordered that the petitioner pay the respondent the annual sum of $2,292.58. The issue was whether the respondent should live in a group home or receive sole rental income on the basis of his income of $293,874 and that the children were adequately provided for. 1)The respondent did not need financial assistance. He did not manage his finances well and reference was made to the fact that he spends over 25 per cent of his present income on luxuries of eating out, entertainment, recreation and cigarettes. The actual amount is $210.00 which is 33% of the respondent's present income. 2)There was no requirement that the respondent live in group home and there is no basis upon which can order or expect such. As to the matter of luxurious living, do not see monthly expenditure of $200.00 to amount to such. 3)The petitioner had three sources of income, namely a Canada Pension Disability Pension, Canada Pension Plan Benefits, Disability Insurance, and Pension for the three children. 4)The court ordered the petitioner to pay $500.00 month to the respondent."
d_2007skqb324.txt,"This is an application by the accused for an order that evidence obtained by way of a telephone interception be ruled inadmissible because it is irrelevant. Alternatively, the accused seeks exclusion of the intercepted communication on the basis that it was conducted in violation of s. 8 of the Charter and ought to be excluded under s. 24(2). The accused is charged with abuse of a position of trust contrary to s. 153(1)(a) of the Code. HELD: The evidence is admissible. The accused's application is dismissed. 1) After examining the transcript of the conversation, it is immediately evident that the contents of the communication are relevant. The complainant and the accused are discussing the intimate details of their relationship. The conversation is logically probative to the charge. 2) The learned provincial court judge did in fact have sufficient evidence before him to issue the telephone intercept authorization. The complainant was prepared to initiate a telephone call to the accused and engage him in a conversation which would likely cause the accused to make admissions or statements which could be confirmatory of her allegations. 3) The authorization clearly permits the police to intercept private communications in relation to an offence under s. 271(1) of the Code. That investigation was live and bona fide at the time that the authorization was obtained. The law in this country is that evidence of other crimes revealed during the course of a lawful intercept process does not render the evidence obtained inadmissible in relation to an offence not named in the authorization. The focus is on whether the interception was lawfully obtained and executed, not on what is discovered. Here the police obtained a valid authorization to intercept private communications in relation to an offence under s. 271(1) of the Code. During the investigation of that charge, they obtained evidence which is relevant to an offence under s. 153(1)(a) of the Code. The fact that the offence of s. 153(1)(a) is not named in the authorization nor included as an offence for which an authorization to intercept private communications could be obtained, does not affect the admissibility of the evidence. Therefore, there is no Charter breach. 4) Even if the evidence was obtained in violation of s. 8 of the Charter, such evidence is considered non-conscriptive evidence. Where the evidence is non-conscriptive, the court ought to go on to do a balancing as to whether or not the evidence ought to be excluded pursuant to s. 24(2) of the Charter. The factors to be considered are trial fairness, seriousness of the breach and the effect of exclusion. In this case if there is a breach, it was not serious and was inadvertent, the result of unmindful draftsmanship. There is no evidence of bad faith. There is no evidence of manipulation. The seriousness of the breach, if there was one, was minimal, and to admit the evidence would not bring the administration of justice into disrepute.","This was an application by the accused for an order that evidence obtained by way of a telephone interception be ruled inadmissible because it is irrelevant. Alternatively, the accused seeks exclusion of the intercepted communication on the basis that it was conducted in violation of s. 8 of the Charter. HELD: The evidence is relevant and admissible in that it does not violate the accused's s.8 rights. Even if there was a breach, due to an invalid authorization to intercept private communication or because the offence before the court is not one specified in the authorization, such a breach does not lead to automatic exclusion under s. 24(2) of the charter. The evidence under consideration should be classified as conscriptive evidence because the respondent essentially acted as police agent in the course of the conversation.  1)The respondent had reasonable and probable grounds to believe that the accused had committed offences. The surreptitious recording did not compel or coerce the appellant to speak. 2)There was no evidence of bad faith or manipulation. The respondent's evidence was non-conscriptive and should not be excluded."
5_1995canlii4187.txt,"This was an appeal from the conviction of the appellant that he broke and entered a used car dealership and stole a vehicle, contrary to s. 348(1)(b) of the Criminal Code. The theft was reported to police by a passing motorist who saw the vehicle being driven off the car lot early in the morning. The vehicle was spotted on the highway, and when stopped, was exited by two individuals. Two officers followed tracks through a wooded area, and noted that in two areas the tracks broke through ice on a brook. Shortly thereafter the appellant came out of the woods on a nearby road; his lower body was wet and chunks of ice and snow clung to his clothing. The imprint of his footwear resembled that of the tracks in the snow. The appellant was convicted, based on the doctrine of recent possession. He argued there was no evidence he was in recent possession of the stolen vehicle. Dismissing the appeal, that there was sufficient evidence to support the findings of fact made by the trial judge. The judgment of the trial judge was consistent with R. v. Kowlyk (1988), 43 C.C.C. (3d) 1 (S.C.C.).","This was an appeal from a conviction for break, enter and theft contrary to s. 348(1)(b) of the Criminal Code. The appellant claimed the trial judge erred in law by applying the doctrine mainly because there was no evidence that he was in recent possession of the Blazer. Dismissing the appeal, that although the evidence was circumstantial, the facts led to no other reasonable inference than the guilt of the appellant."
d_1997canlii11011.txt,"An application to vary the terms of a 1995 consent judgment such that the applicant would have sole custody. Alternatively he sought an order preventing the mother from removing their daughter from Saskatchewan. The father obtained an ex parte order preventing the mother from removing the child from the province until the return date of the motion. The mother had always been the primary caregiver and had custody since the separation in 1994. The father had exercised regular and frequent access. She was given exclusive possession of the matrimonial home under the terms of the consent judgment which contemplated the home would be listed for sale and the net proceeds divided between the parties. Subsequent to the consent judgment the applicant went through bankruptcy proceedings in which he transferred his interest in the home to the trustee who then sold that interest to the respondent such that the applicant no longer had any interest in the home. HELD: 1)Relocation was neither foreseen nor reasonably contemplated by the judge making the original order. The threshold criteria was thus satisfied. 2)The trial of an issue was required as the matter could not be decided on the basis of affidavit evidence. The child had a close relationship with both parents. The disruption as a result of a change in custody or removal of the child from the community could not be assessed. 3)The applicant's request for interim relief was denied. If the mother proceeded with her move a revision of the access provision would be appropriate. 4)The child's best interest is the proper test to be applied (Cote) having regard to the factors identified by the Supreme Court of Canada in Gordon. 5)The applicant became aware in early June of the mother's intention to move to British Columbia and did not object. The timing of the application, a few weeks prior to the proposed move, raised the suspicion that it was the respondent's decision to sell the matrimonial home which prompted this application.  6)Costs were left to the trial judge.","This was an application to vary the terms of a consent judgment such that the applicant would have sole custody of their daughter, Letitia. In the alternative the applicant seeks an order preventing the respondent from removing their daughter from the province of Saskatchewan. HELD: The application was heard in chambers on affidavit evidence. 1)The respondent was a good mother and there was nothing to dispute the applicant's close relationship with his daughter and relationship with extended family members. The timing of the application raised the suspicion that it was the respondent's decision to sell the matrimonial home which prompted this application. While to permit the move, pending trial, will result in a disruption to the child's access arrangements and the relationship between the parties, the best interests of the child are rightly presumed to lie with the custodial parent. The finding of material change effectively erases that presumption. 2)The court was not able to assess the effect of a disruption as a result of a change in circumstances as the trial of an issue would be required."
1991canlii4370.txt,"The defendant lawyer was retained for the purpose of obtaining and disbursing mortgage funds. The plaintiffs, creditors of the defendant's client, sued the defendant for negligent misrepresentation, breach of trust and breach of undertaking. The defendant initially received three irrevocable letters of direction for payment of amounts owing on a construction project. When the project got into financial difficulty the defendant advised his client to seek separate counsel to deal with the creditors - suppliers. At a creditors meeting the defendant advised the creditors' counsel of the initial three letters of direction. The project was considered viable by the creditors and continued, with the defendant obtaining postponements of the three letters of direction. Further creditors' meetings were held, a Creditors' Committee struck, and subsequent letters of direction sent to the defendant by the client and certain creditors. The defendant, in acknowledging a subsequent letter of direction, made no mention of the earlier three letters, nor any explanation of 'all of the proceeds'. One member of the Committee was aware of the initial irrevocable letters of direction. On what was to be the final mortgage draw, the defendant requested and was refused a postponement of the initial three letters. With his client's consent, the defendant disbursed the funds, to pay off the initial three creditors, a mechanics' lien referred in one of the subsequent letters of direction, his legal fees and the balance as per a letter of direction received from two of three members of the Creditors' Committee. Dismissing the action, that (1) there was no negligent misrepresentation as the creditors had continued to advance supplies, not on the basis of the defendant's letter of acknowledgement, but because they considered the project viable. Further, certain other plaintiffs were not aware of the letter, and could not have relied on it. Other plaintiffs did not supply after the letter and therefore did not rely on it. The Court noted that on a balance of probabilities, the defendant's disbursement did not cause the demise of the project. At the time of the disbursement the project was still viable and the plaintiffs made their own decision to cease supplying and to lien the project;  (2) there was no breach of trust as the defendant had no fiduciary duty and had at no time acted for the plaintiffs;  and  (3) there was no breach of undertaking as the undertaking must be considered in all the circumstances, including knowledge of the plaintiffs, the other letters and meetings. The Court concluded that the member of the Creditors' Committee who was aware of the initial irrevocable letters had a duty to advise the other members. The documentation was clear that legal fees would be deducted and the Committee was also aware of the direction to pay the mechanics' lien.","This was an action brought by the plaintiffs against the defendant for negligent misrepresentation and breach of trust. Dismissing the action, that the defendant's written acknowledgement of the irrevocable letters of direction and disbursements of mortgage advances was in conflict with the plaintiff's representations and warranties as to the purpose and purpose of the letter of direction. The defendant was retained to act as general counsel to the project. The project was financially tight from the very beginning and cash flow was continuously problem. In early 1987 the defendant disbursed funds to three mortgage brokers, one of whom was the plaintiff, the second mortgagee, and the third mortgagee. The first mortgagee had become dissatisfied with the handling of the project funds by one of the principals of and was withdrawing its support. The second mortgage was ordered to pay the mortgage brokerage fees of and the account of the architects, Goguen and Goruen, as well as an unreasonably unacknowledged letter to the plaintiff providing for the payment of mortgage proceeds upon the signature of certain individuals only. The plaintiff disallowed the payments of the mortgage advances in order to avoid any apparent conflicts of interest and to follow the instructions of his clients."

HELD: Application allowed.  1) The parties agree that the rent for July was paid on July 27. The landlord then immediately applied for and was granted a writ of possession. 2) The tenants advise that the landlord holds the equivalent of one month's rent as security for the payment of the last month rent of the tenancy. The landlord claims it is a security deposit. 3) The tenants claim they tendered the arrears on the basis that the landlord would not apply for a writ of possession and that the arrears were accepted on that basis. 4) The Court of Queen's Bench Chambers judge dismissed the appellant's appeal the same day saying 'the rent for August has not been paid and not paid by required time, appeal is dismissed'. 5) The first issue on appeal is whether the Chambers judge erred in finding the Rentalsman had jurisdiction to make the order granting possession on the basis that 'the rent was 15 days in arrears when the Notice of Termination of the tenancy agreement was served and the tenant has failed to vacate the premises in accordance with the Notice' if the landlord accepted the rent in lieu of seeking a writ of possession. The second issue on appeal is whether the Chambers judge erred in considering that the subsequent month's rent was not paid.","The tenants apply pursuant to s.49(2) of The Residential Tenancies Act for leave to appeal a decision of the Court of Queen's Bench reviewing a Rentalsman decision. Their reasons were as follows: The rent was 15 days or more in arrears when the Notice of Termination of the tenancy agreement was served and the tenant has failed to vacate the premises in accordance with the Notice. Based on the evidence provided, the Landlord's claim has been sufficiently proven and an Order should be made placing the landlord in possession of the rental premises.

7_1995canlii4030.txt,"After a series of pre-trial conferences, and the exchange of some correspondence between the parties lawyers, the husband took the position that the parties had reached a binding agreement as to the value of his pension. The wife disagreed and a trial of this issue was directed and determined in the husband's favour. The wife appealed. HELD: Appeal allowed.  1)Since the judgment of this Court in Childs v. Childs Estate, [1988] 1 W.W.R. 746, there is no doubt that a judge has the power, under Rule 7 of s. 44 of The Queen's Bench Act, R.S.S. 1978, c. Q-1, to enforce or set aside an agreement compromising an action by summary proceedings. The law as stated in that judgment applies as well to agreements or settlements reached during the course of pre-trial conferences. 2)Parties will not usually intend to settle selected issues on a piecemeal basis, but rather will reach tentative agreements on selected issues conditional on an overall settlement agreement being concluded. Such was the parties' intention in this case, and accordingly, there was no settlement contract for the judge in the court below to enforce.  3)This is not to say that parties cannot reach several separate independent, binding and enforceable agreements as part of an effort to reach an overall settlement of the matters in issue between them, but in order to do so, the intention of the parties to settle on a piecemeal or installment basis must be clear. Nothing in the evidence indicated such an intention in this case. 4)In cases of settlement agreements reached at a pre- trial conference, the application to enforce, or to set aside, should be made under Rule 7 of s. 44 of The Queen's Bench Act as was done in Childs and not under Rule 184A as was the developing practice.","This was an appeal from an order that determined, after trial of an issue, that the parties had reached a binding agreement as to the value of the respondent's pension plan during a series of pre-trial conferences. The judge found that this information was available to the appellant when the letters were exchanged between the appellant and her counsel when the parties agreed that the pension should be valued at $39,411 and that Mrs. Verma should be bound by her agreement as of its value. She relied on the following statement of Dickson J. of the Unified Family Court in Zimmerman v. Zimmerman (1992), 1992 CanLII 8027 (SK QB), 104 Sask. R. 150) and in concurrence with the Queen's Bench judge, that settlement should not be enforced by the court if it is 'obviously incomplete'."
3_2004skqb374.txt,"FIAT: In 1996, the respondent was ordered to pay $600 per month as child support for his daughter. He now applies to reduce his support obligation and rescind the arrears which have accumulated. HELD: 1) In 1999, the respondent sold his ownership interest in a business and retained a one-third interest. In 2001, he was terminated from his full-time employment as a result of an unexplained absence from work after he received a suspension for insubordination. Since his termination, he has not obtained full-time employment. He has continued to work seasonally 3 months a year and earn the gross amount of $21,000. The Court found that it is the respondent's choice to work a minimum amount each year. It has been said that individuals, who are subject to support obligations, are entitled to make decisions in relation to their careers as long as the decisions are reasonable at the time having regard to the circumstances. The respondent's decision to work only three months a year and to possibly return to school is not reasonable. 2) For the purposes of this application, the respondent's income was imputed to be $40,000 and he was ordered to pay $328 per month as support for his daughter. 3) The sharing of the s. 7 special expenses should be based on the respondent's imputed income. 4) A retroactive variation of child support is warranted. The respondent commenced his application for variation in June 2002 and the chambers judge was of the view that any variation of support should be retroactive to September 2002.  In light of the fact the respondent's previous support obligation was tax deductible/tax inclusive, the petitioner may in fact benefit from a retroactive variation as the child support she will receive, pursuant to this order, will be payable on a net of tax basis.  5) Rule 608(2) provides that a successful party will be entitled to costs of a family law proceeding unless, pursuant to Rule 608(3), the successful party has behaved unreasonably or has acted in bad faith. The difficulty in the matter before me is determining whether or not the respondent has been successful. Although his support obligation decreases, his previous payment was tax deductible while his ongoing payment will be net of tax. It is very likely that the respondent's financial position has not changed as a result of the order. The Court also had grave concerns respecting the substantial delays in the proceedings caused by the respondent's unwillingness to provide financial disclosure. Costs were awarded to the petitioner in the sum of $750, as the discovery motion would not have been necessary had the respondent provided appropriate financial disclosure.","FIAT: The father of one child applied to reduce his support obligation and rescind arrears which had accumulated since his order for child support.

HELD: 1) The father's decision to work a minimum amount each year and, if he should return to school, it will be his choice to attend school and severely limit his earnings for a significant period of time. It is very likely that the father's financial position has not changed as result of the order for support for his child. The difficulty in the matter is determining whether or not the father has, indeed, been successful on this motion. 2) On all of the evidence, the father is underemployed. His choice to work only three months of the year and/or return to work is not a reasonable decision when he has a continuing obligation to provide support to his child, Stephanie. 3) The mother has grave concerns respecting the substantial delays in this proceeding, which delays were primarily the result of Mr. Pilat's unwillingness to provide adequate financial disclosure.  4) Costs awarded to the mother in the sum of $750."

c_2016skqb374.txt,"HELD: The appeal as to the convictions and the sentences imposed was dismissed. The court found with respect to each issue that the trial judge had not erred: 1) the defence had acknowledged the appellant had used force and that his spouse had not consented to it. Therefore the appellant could not argue on appeal that the trial judge failed to take implied consent into account. The trial judge was entitled to accept the spouse’s testimony as she was not cross-examined at trial. There was nothing in the transcript that showed the trial judge took a zero tolerance approach. The trial judge found that defence of de minimis was not open to the appellant based on her finding that the application of force by the appellant was more than trifling. On appeal, the court could not substitute its view of the evidence from that of the trial judge; 2) the trial judge found that the appellant intentionally drove in a manner that he knew created a danger for others and to frighten his spouse. She was entitled to conclude the appellant’s conduct was a marked departure from that expected of reasonably prudent driver. The evidence was reasonably capable of supporting her decision; and 3) the appellant had not identified how the trial judge had erred on any of the grounds an appeal court could consider. It was not open to it to intervene only because it would have weighed sentencing factors differently from the trial judge.","The accused was convicted of dangerous driving and assault. The accused conceded that all elements of an assault offence under s. 266 of the Criminal Code had been made out by the Crown. He was sentenced to 18 months probation plus 18 months’ probation. The complainant was not an overly cooperative witness and refused to repeat any conversation she had with the accused on the day of the offence based on spousal privilege set out in s. 4(3) of the Canada Evidence Act. HELD: The appeal was dismissed. 1) The trial judge properly instructed herself on the law and that her findings of fact were supported by the evidence. 2) There was nothing in the transcript which suggested the trial judge took a zero tolerance approach to domestic assault without consideration to the fact that the manner in which the appellant drove was inherently dangerous. 3) Although some re-examination and re-weighing of the evidence was allowed to determine if it was reasonably capable of supporting the Crown’s conclusion, it was not a momentary lapse."

The sentence was imposed for robbery with threats of violence contrary to s.348(1)(b) and s.334(2) of the Criminal Code which were committed in March 2000 while the accused was on probation. The appellant and co-accused were convicted of breaking and entering a private residence. The accused took $25 from the premises and held the 68 year old victim while the co-accused went to look for a knife after threatening to cut off his fingers.

The 23 year old aboriginal who had a Grade 3 education had a prior record of 42 criminal convictions including eight violent or weapons related offences. HELD: Leave was granted. The appeal was allowed. The sentence of 4 years in prison on each charge to be served concurrently took into account time served on remand and electronic monitoring. The sentence was demonstrably unfit and fell outside the range of sentences previously imposed. The sentencing judge relied solely on the principle of rehabilitation, essentially ignoring the other sentencing principles including the level of gravity, the principle of deterrence, the need to denounce such acts, the sentence imposed on the co-accused, and the need to protect the public. A sentencing circle was inappropriate given the level of violence, his risk to re-offend, his consistent ignoring or refusal to follow court orders, and the fact that a penitentiary term was called for in such circumstances. He had violated various forms of community release orders including bail and probation 16 times. He had a history of drug and alcohol abuse and had not attended treatment.","The Crown sought leave to appeal the sentence imposed on the respondent after a sentencing circle.

For the respondent, that the Education Act requires a request be made of the Minister in proper form and receive Governor in Council approval.

The standard of proof in criminal cases is high, but not as high as that in civil cases, where the proof must be beyond reasonable doubt. The Court adopted the position adopted in J.L. v.

It is not always possible to articulate with precision the complex intermingling of impressions that emerge after watching and listening to witnesses and attempting to reconcile the various versions of events. The principles and tools to be used in assessing credibility are summarized in Novak Estate (Re), 2008 NSSC 283. 2) Certain of the evidence of the Karpinskis and Ms. Mui is so unreliable that the whole of their evidence is cast with doubt. 3) The opinions and conclusions of Mr. Loraas and Mr. Epp are accepted by the court. They are professionals with no interest in the outcome of the action. Their evidence was largely unchallenged. The Court finds that the pine shakes were rotten, sealant had been applied to the shakes on at least two occasions and prior to the plaintiff offering to buy the property, the shakes were not properly installed allowing water to seep into the house, the skylight leaked and caulking had been applied to stop the leaking before the plaintiff offered to buy the house, there was improper and inadequate venting which resulted in moisture damage to the interior of the house and mold in the attic, the moisture damage in the house included damage to drywall and paint blisters. Nail pops throughout the house were largely the result of the house being moved. No inspection was done after the house was moved. 4) The Court finds the Karpinskis did not speak truthfully or completely when they answered the questions in the Property Condition Disclosure Statement (PCDS). The Court does not accept that the vendors were not aware of water and moisture damage arising from the improperly installed shingles, the missing ridge caps, the leaking skylight or the lack of venting. The sealant on the roof was sufficiently old to predate the plaintiff's purchase of the house. The vendors repaired the sink holes and moisture pockets and effectively concealed the problems. It should have been disclosed. Although the vendors denied knowing of the structural damage to their house, they knew the house had been cut in half and moved 300 kilometers and had sustained damage. The structural problems were concealed by the vendors through repairs to the dry wall, reinforcement at stress points, and repainting and patching of wall paper. The fact that the house had been cut in half and moved should have been disclosed on the PCDS. 5) It is not only current defects or ongoing problems that need to be disclosed on a PCDS. A prospective purchaser does not look to the PCDS only to ascertain that the roof is not leaking on the day it was signed, see Kaufmann v. Gibson, [2007] O.J. No. 2711 (Ont. S.C.) (QL). The Karpinskis are liable to the plaintiff for breach of contract for failing to disclose the existence of structural defects, damage due to water and roof leakage. The terms of the PCDS formed part of the agreement between the parties and the deliberate withholding of this information amounted to a false representation as to the condition of the home. With respect to damage arising from these defects, the doctrine of caveat emptor does not apply. 6) The requirements for negligent misrepresentation have been established by the plaintiff. The failure to disclose, or silence as to a known defect, amounts to an act of concealment of a material fact and has the same effect as an express misrepresentation and is sufficient to attract liability, Thomas v. Blackwell, 1999 SKQB 168. 7) The false representations knowingly made by the vendors and their silence as to material facts were fraudulent. 8) Ms. Mui was negligent and her conduct and advice to the plaintiff fell below the standard of care expected of a realtor acting for the purchaser of a rural property in 1999. She did not conduct any preliminary background checks with the Rural Municipality, which would include determining if proper permits had been obtained, prior to the plaintiff's offer to purchase. Ms. Mui did nothing more than merely mention a home inspection to the plaintiff on one occasion. At no time did she recommend a home inspection even after she knew the house had been moved and before the condition regarding a satisfactory PCDS was removed. Another reason to strongly recommend a home inspection would be in circumstances where the realtor knew that a rural municipality did not require building inspections and Ms. Mui knew this to be the case. The plaintiff relied on the representation of Ms. Mui to her detriment. Had Ms. Mui disclosed all material facts to the plaintiff and explained and recommended a home inspection, the Court is satisfied that the outcome for the plaintiff would have been different. Knowing the house had been moved and had not been inspected the plaintiff would have most likely reconsidered her decision to purchase. 9) The Court is satisfied that Mr. Jacabucci is liable to the plaintiff for negligent misrepresentation. He represented that the home was of 'quality construction'. This was incorrect. Mr. Jacobucci was also complicit in, and party to, the negligent misrepresentations made by the vendors in the PCDS. He knew the house had been moved and sustained damage. He also knew the skylight leaked. The plaintiff relied on these misrepresentations and damages resulted.  10) The costs incurred by the plaintiff to repair the house total $17,613. She is awarded $15,000 as compensation for personal time and effort that she expended in repairing the home. There is no evidence that the distress the plaintiff experienced constituted a physical injury, or a recognized psychiatric illness and she cannot be compensated for mental distress, whether under tort or breach of contract. She is awarded $10,000 for aggravated damages. Her claim for punitive damages is dismissed. Her claim for solicitor and client costs is dismissed. Corrigendum received dated December 3, 2009 and added to fulltext.","The plaintiff decided to purchase a home. She hired the services of a realtor associated with the defendant, 100% Realty Associates, operating as RE/MAX Saskatoon. After a lengthy search, the plaintiff purchased a country home. The realtor, Cecilia Mui, was negligent in misrepresenting certain facts and breached the fiduciary duty expected of her. She also claimed aggravated damages against all defendants and punitive damages against Mr. and Mrs. Karpinski, asserting that their acts and omissions exacerbated her distress. The house did not meet the plaintiff's expectations and she now sues the defendants seeking recovery of damages for alleged latent defects in the house. HELD: The court found that the defendants were liable to the plaintiff in damages both in negligence and as parties to the misrepresentations made by the realtor.  1) The plaintiff was not the only one experiencing problems with her home. It was clear from reading of the building permit that the rural municipality did not do any inspections of moved or newly constructed residences. 2) The defendant was the only realtor who had any expertise or knowledge about construction. 3) The court ordered the plaintiff to pay $275,000 for the home and $350,000 to be paid by the defendant. 4) There was no discussion of home inspection or home inspection. The defendant's realtor was a friend of the plaintiff. She was not a party to any of the appraisals. 5) The Court ordered the defendant to pay the plaintiff $285,000.00 for the purchase of the home.  6) The price of the house was $299,000 with a possession date of August 6, 1999. The only conditions to attach to the offer were that it was subject to the approval of satisfactory PCDS by June 21, 1999 and that any existing mineral rights be included in the PCDS. 7) The offer was rejected by both the defendant and the plaintiff and was accepted by both parties."
d_2006nsca124.txt,"The accused successfully challenged the sufficiency of the grounds to issue a search warrant that was used to search her residence. Although the Information to Obtain was based on information from an anonymous, unproven source, the source's information was corroborated by independent information as to the accused's employment and residence. The only corroboration of the presence of a crime (a suspected marijuana grow operation) was from a FLIR test. The court found that the evidence did not rise above the level of suspicion, albeit strong suspicion. Corroboration of the employment and residence of the accused did not provide particular support for the informant's credibility; neither were results of the FLIR test and the presence of covered windows sufficient corroboration. The Crown appealed. Appeal allowed; new trial ordered. Although the trial judge articulated the proper test and began by analyzing whether the warrant could have been issued, the issue was later mistakenly transformed into whether he, himself, would have issued it. By weighing the probative evidence, the trial judge effectively substituted his views for those of the issuing justice and wrongly required the issuing justice to draw proper inferences as opposed to reasonable inferences.","The Crown appealed the decision to quash the search warrant. The Crown argued that the judge misapplied the legal standard upon which he was to review the warrant. HELD: The appeal was allowed and a new trial ordered. The court found that the trial judge erred in law by failing to apply the so-called Garofoli test, which requires that reasonable and probable grounds exist to determine if evidence of a crime could be found in the impugned place. The judge applied the test to determine whether a search warrant was quashed in error. The evidence obtained as a result of the search was wrongly excluded and had it been admitted, the result would not necessarily have been the same."
9_2012skpc49.txt,"The accused plead guilty to two counts of sexual assault. The victims were his granddaughters. The assaults were alleged to have occurred between 1983 and 1991. A sentencing hearing was held because there was significant disagreement on the facts. The Crown alleged three aggravating factors: 1) that the sexual assaults were numerous, 2) that the accused touched the victims directly on their skin and not just on their clothing and 3) that there was digital penetration by the accused on both victims. HELD: At a sentencing hearing, the Crown must prove aggravating factors beyond a reasonable doubt. The Court held that the two victims were sexually assaulted by the accused on numerous occasions over a period of a number of years. The Court was satisfied these sexual assaults were a common occurrence on every occasion that the accused was in the company of his granddaughters. The Court found that the accused touched the victims under their clothing on numerous occasions and that there were a couple of occasions that the accused digitally penetrated each victim. Finally, the Court concluded that the accused got bolder over time and took more liberties and chances with his victims.","The accused was charged with sexual assault contrary to s. 724(3)(e) of the Criminal Code. HELD: The Court found beyond a reasonable doubt that the accused's conduct was not an isolated incident or even restricted to few occasions. The evidence establishes that the abuse occurred over several years, many times. The test is not the number of times digital penetration occurred. The accused has no doubt recalled the incidents of digital penetration as this more severe abuse would stand out from the other occasions.  1) The Court must consider the issue of reliability of the witnesses. Both victims testified and provided sufficient detail such as location, what they were wearing, what was going on, their many years of silence, the fact the accused testified that it did not happen, the difficulty of putting the incidents out of his mind and the fact that the Court cannot be expected to recall a specific event. 2) The accused got bolder as time passed and took more liberties and chances. He admitted that he could not remember all the times he rubbed the victims' skin and that there was digital penetration by the accused of both victims."

The development officer found the application to be incomplete and the applicant applied for certiorari and mandamus. Certiorari granted; declaration issued that application for final subdivision approval was complete; order for mandamus granted and the development officer directed to issue final approval (subject only to the applicant correcting the technical error in the plan). The development officer's decision was based on interpretation of relevant legislation and the proper standard of review is correctness. The development officer misinterpreted the legislation. Since the applicant had already received tentative approval under the old regime, it did not have to meet the new higher standards for final approval. There was not another legal remedy open to the applicant equally convenient, beneficial and appropriate. The right of appeal under the legislation existed only from a refusal by a development officer and technically, this was not a refusal as the application was found incomplete.

Prior to being sentenced, he spent 13 days on remand and 2 months under house arrest under s.7.1 of the Young Offenders Act. The Crown appealed the sentence. HELD: Appeal allowed. 1)The accused was 15 years of age and had no record. He assisted the police once apprehended. 2)Although another young offender involved in these offences had received a sentence of 9 months open custody, uniformity of sentence was not a factor to be given great weight in comparing dispositions of young offenders. 3)The sentence was increased to 10 months open custody.","A young offender pled guilty to 16 counts of auto theft, one count of possession of stolen auto and two counts of dangerous driving.

4_2008skqb174.txt,"Accused pleaded guilty at opening of trial to one count of distributing child pornography in the form of written works. The accused was active on a pedophile website and posted 11 stories describing sexual activity between men and infants and pre-teen girls. HELD: Accused received 15 months imprisonment followed by 3 years of probation with addition orders including providing DNA samples and being added to the Sex Offender Registry. The Court accepted that the internet has led to the accelerated proliferation of child pornography, making it an increasing social problem. The social harm of such material is borne almost exclusively by infants and children, the most defenceless members of society. For this reason, denunciation and deterrence are the dominant sentencing principles. The defence submitted that the writings do not actually harm children in their making and, therefore, should not be subject to the same denunciation as pornographic images. The Court rejected this argument because it cannot be assumed that the writings do not stimulate the demand for images and since not all pedophiles are voyeurs only some will act on their desires and anything that stimulates this desire places children at risk in the real world. Aggravating factors in this case were 1) the fact that the accused extolled pedophilia and wrote hard core child pornography and encouraged others to the same. 2) The accused was a high profile contributor to the web site and he remains unrepentant Ã» he does not believe there is anything wrong with writing these stories and only stopped because the law requires it. A conditional sentence would not represent sufficient denunciation or deterrence. Mitigating factors in this case included a lack of criminal record, the guilty plea and the fact that the accused is looking after his elderly mother.","The defendant pled guilty at the opening of trial to distribution of child pornography contrary to s. 163.1(3) of the Criminal Code. The defendant had 1,200 postings on a pedophile website, which included 11 stories that were the subject of the charge and described sexual activity between adults and either infants or preteen girls. The moderator of the website encouraged stories, and the defendant wrote hard core child pornography in several of his stories, which on the scale of written child pornography places it in the upper half of the scale. The fact that he disclosed his stories were largely fantasies is not mitigating factor that detracts from the effects such written pornography has, as set out above."

The plaintiff was to provide labour and the necessary equipment to feed and maintain the cows for $.50 per cow per day. The defendant was to provide the feed and medicine. At paragraph 6 the contract stipulated that the plaintiff was to receive a bonus for each live calf that he got to pasture. The amount of the bonus was left blank. The plaintiff sues the defendant, claiming a bonus for the 2004-2005 year and the 2005-2006 year. HELD: The claim is dismissed. In law an agreement to come to an agreement is not enforceable. This is especially true where an essential term regarding remuneration has not been agreed to. The parties agreed that they would settle on the bonus amount later on but they never did. The plaintiff believes he is still entitled to a bonus. The Court cannot make the agreement for the parties.","The parties signed a handwritten agreement on the 20th day of October 2004.

Dismissing the application, that (1) pursuant to s. 32 of the Charter, the Charter did not apply to these employees since the university was not a subordinate body of government, and was not being controlled by government, but was an independent institution; the fact that the university's governing statute provided that teaching staff were 'deemed to be persons employed in the public service of the Province' for the purposes of their pension plan did not constitute governmental control such as to warrant the application of the Charter; and (2) the proper forum for this application was the Human Rights Commission. The court also considered the retroactive effect of the Nova Scotia decision in Sniders v. Nova Scotia (Attorney General), which struck down the provision in the Nova Scotia Human Rights Act precluding anyone 65 years or over from making an age discrimination complaint. The court concluded that the Sniders decision did have a retroactive effect to the date when s. 15 of the Charter came into force.","This was an application under s.15(1), 24(1) and 52(2) of the Charter of Rights and Freedoms for an order declaring that the mandatory retirement of the applicants by the respondent was invalid and infringes, denies and is inconsistent with the applicants' rights as guaranteed under the Charter and that they could commence work at the beginning of the September 1990 university term. HELD: The application was granted on all fours with the exception of the Harrison case, which was now awaiting decision by the Supreme Court of Canada. 1)There was no evidence of governmental control that could be regarded as an exercise of government power sufficient to bring the respondent within the application. 2)The private contract, here the Collective Agreement, is not subject to the Charter."
b_2018skqb197.txt,"HELD: The court sentenced the accused to a global sentence of 10 years for the manslaughter conviction. A one-year concurrent sentence was imposed for the conviction of prohibited possession of a firearm. The court gave him credit at the rate of 1:1.5 for his time on remand, resulting in a net global sentence of six years, five months to be served in a federal penitentiary. The Gladue report was considered and the background of the accused was assessed as an enormous mitigating factor. The court found that this was not an appropriate case to make an order pursuant to s. 743.6 of the Code both because of the multiple Gladue factors and because it had addressed the principles of denunciation and deterrence in the global sentence.","The accused pled guilty to second degree murder and a charge of possession of a firearm while prohibited from doing so. Prior to sentencing, the Crown presented six victim impact statements of the siblings of the victim who were killed in the 2016 shooting of his cousin. HELD: The accused was sentenced to a concurrent sentence of 1 year, 5 months, and 10 years, respectively. 1) The court reviewed all of the cases provided to it by counsel and found that a global sentence of 10 years was appropriate for the offence of manslaughter. 2) Although the Crown provided the Court with multiple cases, the court was not prepared to impose an order pursuant to s. 743.6(1) of the Criminal Code primarily as a result of the Court having to recognize the multiple Gladue factors in this case. It is not the intention of the court to repeat the reasons for the verdict of guilty of manslaughter but only the relevant facts to this sentencing decision.  3) The accused had a serious criminal record including 55 previous convictions, 17 of which were for violent offences, a lengthy firearms prohibition at the time of the offence, and a total lack of remorse. The accused's use of a gun in the death of his disabled cousin was very much an aggravating factor as was his willingness to accept a firearm from niece to hunt rabbits and prairie chicken for no apparent reason. He displayed no remorse for his actions."
d_1999skqb276.txt,"FIAT. The plaintiff applied for summary judgment in his claim for dismissal without just cause. The plaintiff was initially hired as body shop foreman but additionally acquired the title of assistant manager. When the body shop manager became ill that work load also fell to the plaintiff. It was during this period that the performance of the plaintiff, described by the defendant as serious misconduct, resulted in his termination. There was no issue of a lack of mitigation as the plaintiff accepted a job with another autobody shop but at a much lower rate of pay. The action was brought pursuant to the simplified procedure outlined in Part 40 of the Rules of Court. HELD: Damages were to be calculated by the parties for the 7 month notice period based on his income and value of benefits over the previous year, less the 6 weeks pay received, and less wages and benefits received from his new employment. Jurisdiction was reserved to hear further evidence should the parties not reach agreement. 1)By using the words 'shall grant judgment unless', Rule 488 requires the presiding judge to grant judgment except in the circumstances outlined in s.488(a)and(b). The test is not whether there is contradictory evidence in the affidavits but whether despite the contradictory evidence the issue(s) can be decided in the absence of cross-examination and it would be otherwise unjust to do so. If the court can assume the defendant's evidence is true and still grant summary judgment there is no genuine need for a trial. 2)As noted in numerous decisions, whether an employer is justified in summarily dismissing an employee is ultimately a question of fact. The plaintiff was not terminated because of poor job performance in performing his contractual duties as foreman and manager but because of his alleged poor performance in doing the job normally assigned to two persons. The employer has the right to expect that employees will not disparage their immediate supervisors or other employees in the course of their employment and certainly not to clients or customers of the employer. The type of conduct here would not justify dismissal the first time it came to the employer's attention if the employee had been guilty of such conduct while performing only his own job function. 'Griping' is not uncommon in the workplace. The case law seems uniform that one or more warnings to an employee must be given before it can be said such activity 'fractures the employment relationship'. The category of misconduct can be said to change from poor attitude to disobedience or insubordination where dismissal results after one or more warnings. 3)The plaintiff was entitled to 7 months notice to reflect the fact that junior management positions are fewer in number and the considerable wage difference between management and non- management positions.  4)The plaintiff was entitled to taxable costs.","FIAT. The plaintiff applied for summary judgment in his claim for dismissal without just cause brought pursuant to the simplified procedure outlined in Part Forty of the Rules of Court. The defendant opposes the application and requests a summary trial. HELD: The plaintiff was not terminated because of poor job performance in performing his contractual duties as bodyshop foreman and assistant manager but because of his alleged poor performance in doing the job normally assigned to two persons. The Court accepted the plaintiff's evidence wherever it conflicted with that of the plaintiff and still concluded that the plaintiff is entitled to judgment. Taking all factors into account, the Court considered this is an appropriate notice period to which the plaintiff was entitled.  1) Rule 488 sets out the test for just cause in any particular fact situation. It is generally accepted that just cause is conduct on the part of the employee incompatible with his or her duties, conduct which goes to the root of the contract with the result that the employment relationship is too fractured to expect the employer to provide a second chance. 2) The plaintiff's damages are to be calculated in the manner set out in the foregoing."

6_2000skqb94.txt,"A jury determined the plaintiff was constructively dismissed from his employment as park superintendent in 1997 and awarded damages for failure to give reasonable notice. The defendant claimed the contract of employment was all inclusive; that the plaintiff exaggerated the amount of time he spent on the job in winter; that the reduced winter hours were not in lieu of overtime pay as he was a manager within the meaning of s.4(2) of the LSA; the doctrine of estoppel or waiver applied as he never claimed a right to holiday pay for 10 years and the employer relied on his not doing so; if the plaintiff is entitled to holiday pay he should only recover back to April 1990 as he is limited by the Limitation of Actions Act; it should not be based on wages plus truck allowance as wages as defined in the LSA does not include allowances for costs. The claim for unpaid holiday pay claimed from April 1988 to October 1997, based on his wages plus one-half his truck expense allowance, was reserved pending a decision by the Court of Appeal as to whether the Court of Queen's Bench has jurisdiction to determine the issue of entitlement to holiday pay. HELD: The claim was dismissed with costs.  1)The Court of Appeal held in Kolodziejski v. Auto Electric Service that the Queens' Bench has jurisdiction to entertain a civil action for non-payment of holiday pay. 2)The plaintiff may rely on s.30(1) of the LSA to establish he is entitled to holidays and on s.33 to establish he entitled to pay in lieu of taking holidays. The onus then shifts to the defendant to prove it complied with some exception in the LSA. Section 75 prevents an employee from waiving his or her entitlement. Whether the plaintiff asserted his right to holiday pay or not, he remained entitled to his annual holidays in accordance with the LSA. 3)The plaintiff can claim for any holiday pay in lieu of time off that he can establish he was entitled to from April 1990 to his termination date. Section 3(1)(f)of the LAA states that a cause of action for recovery of money under a contract, express or implied, must be commenced within 6 years of the date on which the cause arose. 4)The plaintiff clearly indicated that a portion of the truck allowance was made to avoid paying tax. As such it would be contrary to public policy for the Court to appear to endorse the plaintiff's actions by calculating his holiday pay on the basis of his wage and this portion of his truck allowance.  5)The defendant's position that the contract included a component of holiday pay each month was inconsistent with its position that the plaintiff took these days off as holidays during the year. The contract of employment did not include a component of holiday pay in lieu of time off.  6)Failure by the defendant to keep records for the purpose of inspection by the minister does not result in a reverse onus. The onus remains on the plaintiff to establish what holidays he did not take. 7)The plaintiff admitted to taking time away from his duties for personal time and for city business as mayor. The plaintiff was not there in his capacity as superintendent. Section 31(1)(b) indicates that an employee shall be permitted to take holidays in one uninterrupted period. The defendant allowed the plaintiff to take days off in any manner he chose. It was inconsistent that the plaintiff's failure to comply with the notice requirement meant for the benefit of the employer could be used by an employee to disclaim that his days off were holidays. 8)The plaintiff was clearly a manager within the meaning of LSA. Even if he were not a manager, he failed to prove, on a balance of probabilities that he worked overtime hours in excess of the statutory minimum in order to qualify for overtime. Any days off taken by the plaintiff could not be considered taken in lieu of overtime. The days he was away were holidays as defined in s.30 of the LSA. 9)He did not establish he did 3 weeks holidays.","The plaintiff sued for damages from the defendant alleging he was constructively wrongfully dismissed from his employment with the defendant. The plaintiff elected to have the determination of liability and the assessment of damages determined by a civil jury. The jury determined that the plaintiff was entitled to holiday pay in lieu of taking holidays. HELD: The plaintiff was awarded $250,000 in damages for loss of his truck allowance. The defendant awarded $350,000 to the plaintiff for the same amount of holiday pay that he had received in the previous six years. The court found that the defendant had rebutted the presumption of entitlement in accordance with some exception set out in the LSA and awarded the plaintiff $500,000. The amount on which any holiday pay should be based in the event the plaintiff proves he is entitled is determined by the Court of Appeal for Saskatchewan."

7_2006skpc48.txt,"The Crown asks that the accused youth be detained. The Crown concedes that there is no reason to detain the accused youth to ensure her attendance in court or to prevent further occurrences. The Crown asks that she be detained because the crime is so horrible, the case is so strong and the public in La Ronge are so disturbed and shocked by the occurrence that to release the youth would cause a loss of confidence in the administration of justice. HELD: The court does not keep a person in custody simply because they are accused of committing an offence. There must be a necessary and substantial reason to keep a person in custody before they have a trial. The accused youth will be released on strict conditions that will continue until her trial is complete.","The accused youth was charged with serious injury to a member of the La Ronge community. Several individuals told the police that the accused youth is responsible for the injuries. HELD: The accused was released on strict conditions which will continue until her trial was completed. The Crown conceded that there was no reason to detain the youth to ensure her attendance in court, or to prevent further offences on her part. The court reviewed the circumstances surrounding the injuries to the victim and determined that the appropriate sentence, according to law, would be imposed. If convicted at trial, the court will impose a sentence of 18 months in prison."
1995canlii4465.txt,"The plaintiffs statement of claim was served on the defendant in Ontario two days after it was issued. Two weeks later the prothonotary issued default judgment for $8,000, plus $2,880 in interest and $404.42 in costs. The defendant applied, pursuant to Civil Procedure Rule 12.06, to set aside the default judgment, on the ground that the plaintiff did not meet the requirements for obtaining a default judgment from the prothonotary or, in the alternative, on the merits that it had, by affidavit evidence, raised triable issues and provided a reasonable excuse for its failure to file a defence. Dismissing the application with costs of $1,000 to the plaintiff, that although the plaintiff ought to have sought the court's leave to take default judgment such a procedural ommission did not, in the circumstances, prejudice the defendant. Further, while there were triable issues between the parties, the defendant's failure to file a defence was neither a mistake nor an oversight, but rather a deliberate decision so as not to attorn to Nova Scotia jurisdiction, and therefore was not a reasonable excuse.","The plaintiff corporation applied to set aside the default judgment on the basis that the defendant had failed to comply with its obligations under the terms of a Letter Arrangement entered into in 1994 by the defendant corporation with the intention of making recommendations for improvements and reductions in costs. The plaintiff brought an action in Nova Scotia against the defendant, claiming damages for failing to defend. The defendant applied for directions pursuant to Civil Procedure Rule 12.06 to the Court of Appeal to determine the appropriate forum for the action. HELD: The application was dismissed with costs to the plaintiff in the amount of One Thousand Dollars ($1,000.00). 1)The plaintiff had not brought itself within the scope of the remarks of Chief Justice Cowan in Pinard and Pinard v. Bushell et al. (1975), 20 N.S.R. (2d) 317 at p. 333. 2)There was no evidentiary basis sufficient to persuade the Court that in order to do justice between the parties, the defendant should exercise its discretion in favour of the plaintiff.  3)The defendant's application was also dismissed for lack of evidentiary ground. 4)The court found that there were triable issues between the plaintiff and the defendant. It was difficult to see how the defendant was possibly prejudiced as it had already made it clear that it was not going to file a defence in Ontario."
4_2000canlii2633.txt,"The parties were married for 14 years and separated in 1995, entering into a detailed Separation Agreement in 1998. The two children of the marriage are 16 and 8 years of age. There was a long history of relatively short terms of employment and several moves to take employment. The respondent had a grade 12 education and some university courses but no practical skills or training. For the past 3 years, the respondent had made no reasonable efforts for employment, developed no skills of a practical nature, and derived her income from child support payments and the Child Tax Credit and by incurring debt in excess of $20,000.00 The parties had entered bankruptcy during the course of the marriage and had no assets or savings or pension entitlement at the time of separation or acquired since. The petitioner now earned an annual salary of $115,500.00. The Agreement did not address the level of child support in accordance with the Federal Child Support Guidelines, nor did it provide for practical retaining by the Respondent to facilitate employment. This was an exceptional situation that required some adjustment to the Agreement reached by the parties. The court ordered the establishment of a retraining fund of $6,500.00 with direct payments to whatever institution the Respondent may choose. Limited spousal support was to terminate on the earlier of completion of the retraining allowance or transfer of the balance of the outstanding to the Respondent on September 1st, 2001. An adjustment was also made to account for arrears in child support and child support payments.","The parties were married for 14 years and separated in 1995. They had two children, aged 16 and 8. The parties entered into a partial agreement in 1996 that provided for joint care and custody of the children with their primary residence being with their mother and fixing her with the responsibility for their day to day care. The agreement did not address the level of child support in accordance with the Federal Child Support Guidelines nor did it provide a limited capacity or practical retraining by the petitioner to facilitate employment. HELD: 1)The parties had no financial stability in part because they far too readily accessed credit based on future expectations of capacity that had never been realized and they would be wise to cease utilization of credit for short term relief. Doing so in the long run imperils the ability to provide properly for the children.  2)The agreement did provide that if there was a disruption in the father’s income, it would be adjusted to comply with federal child support guidelines. The transfer/tax bonus of $8,643.04 was to be included in the Corollary Relief Judgment when issued. 3)The evidence indicated that the parties’ income was fixed at $6,875.00 per month, an annualized rate of $82,500.00, converted to Canadian dollars at the present currency rate of 1.4, $63,356.07, with an additional $4,800 per month for holidays with his sons."
4_2005skqb279.txt,"The plaintiff claims damages for injuries sustained when he was punched in the face and knocked unconscious by the defendant. Liability is admitted. The plaintiff applies for summary judgment pursuant to Rule 485 of the Queen's Bench Rules. The parties agree that damages should be assessed on the basis of the affidavit evidence. HELD: 1) The defendant pled guilty to a charge of assault causing bodily harm. He was sentenced to a fine of $1,500, placed on probation for 18 months and ordered to make restitution to the plaintiff for the cost of the dental work in the amount of $3,263.30. 2) The plaintiff suffered serious injuries and significant pain for a number of months after the assault. Extensive dental treatment was required and will be required at some point in the future. The plaintiff has minimal scarring. He is awarded general damages of $12,500. 3) The pleadings and the affidavit evidence do not support a substantial award for aggravated damages. However, the photographs graphically depict the extent to which his appearance was altered. Hurt feelings can reasonably be inferred from the fact that the plaintiff was rendered unconscious on the ground in a crowd of onlookers. These circumstances justify an award of aggravated damages in the sum of $2,000. 4) The plaintiff was awarded special damages in the amount of $1,911.70.","The plaintiff claims damages for injuries sustained in the assault. Liability is admitted and the plaintiff now applies for summary judgment and an assessment of damages pursuant to Rule 485.

Awarding the plaintiff $2,000 for general damages and $1,911.70 plus pre-judgment interest. HELD: The plaintiff's general damages were awarded in the range of $12,500.00 to $10,000.00 plus costs and a special interest. The plaintiff did not plead a claim for aggravated damages."
7_2001nssc49.txt,"The parties were divorced two years ago and the matter had been finalized by an appeal decision in June, 1999. Both parties made application to vary child support on the basis of changes (ups and downs) in the farming business. The respondent wife, who recently purchased a house, also applied for lump sum spousal support which claim had been disallowed by the Court of Appeal. Monthly spousal support terminated as wife now self-sufficient; child support increased due to increase in husband's income; lump sum payment of $8,000 awarded to wife to help pay her relocation expenses from move with husband given six months to pay lump sum, but monthly spousal support to continue until the $8,000 was paid in full. Applications to vary should not be entertained simply because of the usual ups and downs of the farming business; the court must strive to average out the individual's ability to pay in such circumstances in order to ensure stability of payments for both parties. Lump sum spousal support payments must not have the effect of a significant redistribution of the division of matrimonial property but the reasons for the belated application must be examined.","The parties applied to vary spousal and/or child support less than 2 years after being divorced and less than one year after the Court of Appeal decision which settled the support awards of the trial judge. HELD: 1) The court reviewed the farming income over the years and also the family's and Mr. Vermeulen's standard of living and concluded it would be reasonable to impute or set the respondent's income at $30,000 for support purposes. 2) The respondent had not demonstrated material change in the circumstances based on his poor farming results in 1999 and his improved employment and income situation. 3) The lump sum award was ordered at $8,000 per month. 4) The Court reviewed the remaining assets of the parties, especially their RRSP's and other expenses such as furniture, etc., and found that the respondent should prima facie bear their own costs. 5) In the circumstances, the respondent has not established an immediate need for a lump sum support for relocation expenses for the reasons mentioned above. Although moving expenses are not extraordinary expenses unless they are at an elite level and materially more expensive than the ordinary and find they are not, they do create an asset and could be justifiable expense."
c_2007nsca4.txt,"The appellants applied for leave to amend their notice of appeal in regard to an order requiring them to post security for costs with respect to certain interlocutory applications. The application was opposed, inter alia, on the basis that the allegations which underlie the proposed amendment were not justiciable issues before the trial judge, were irrelevant on the application and were not ruled on by the trial judge. Application to amend the notice of appeal allowed; the amendment is reasonably necessary for the presentation of the appeal and will not occasion prejudice to the respondent. The respondent's opposition to the application fundamentally misconceived the role of a chambers judge who is asked to grant leave to amend a notice of appeal. It is not the role of a chambers judge to rule on the substantive merits of the arguments the appellants wish to make. The focus in this situation is on whether there is any prejudice to the respondent as a result of this issue being raised by amendment rather than in the original notice of appeal.","The appellants apply for leave to amend their notice of appeal. Leave is required because the notice was filed more than 20 days ago: Rule 62.04(4). The application is opposed by the respondent 2301072 Nova Scotia Limited and the intervenor. As, in their view, their arguments in opposition to the amendment relate to the merits of the point raised by it, those arguments are for a panel and not chambers judge to consider. The amendment should be granted but without limiting the responding parties from arguing these points before the panel."
1999skqb17.txt,"The plaintiff alleged he was sexually assaulted and that Attorney General of Canada as employer of the administrator of the residential school was also responsible. The defendant alleged the First Nation was responsible for the administrator's conduct and applied to join the First Nation as a third party so that contribution or indemnity could be claimed. The applicant required leave under s.7 of the Contributory Negligence Act and Rule 107A(c) of the Rules of Court. HELD: Leave was granted to file a third party notice. 1)The low threshold for the establishment of a prima facie claim was met. 2)The delay would not be inordinate. The plaintiff's claim dated back to 1984. The parties were not ready for trial. No prejudice was established.  3)The third party's liability, if any, will have to be determined on a case by case basis. Each individual action brought by a former student at the residential school is different in nature. 4)The applicant was granted costs of the application against the plaintiff and the First Nation.","The applicant applied to join the G[…] First Nation as a third party to the action brought by the plaintiff against it and Starr; so that it can claim contribution or indemnity from it if the applicant is found liable to the plaintiff. HELD: The application was granted. To attain uniformity, it seems reasonable on an application for leave under s.7 to encourage the joinder of third parties thereby averting duplication in law suits, and to minimize delay and prejudice to the applicant by appropriate directions rather than refusal of leave."
2_2009nspc21.txt,"The defendant farmer pled guilty to failing to take every precaution that was reasonable in the circumstances to ensure the health and safety of persons in the workplace, after a young employee drowned in a manure pit that was not properly secured due to a damaged barricade having been removed while a new one was on order. Defendant sentenced to fine of $25,000, from which the sum of $15,000 shall be paid to the Canadian Farmers' Disability Registry; defendant ordered to perform 160 hours of community service with respect to farm safety. The defendant was an individual and not a huge corporation, had been conscientious about safety issues prior to this incident and had endeavored to improve safety at his farm after the incident; the deceased had also failed in his responsibilities under the Act and was working with a significant blood alcohol content.","The defendant pleaded guilty to an offence under the Occupational Health and Safety Act that he failed to take every precaution that is reasonable in the circumstances to ensure the health and safety of persons at the workplace. The defendant's guilty plea relates to the fact that on August 13, 2006, there was a manure pit on the farm that did not have a barrier. He had been out all night at social event, had been drinking and had not slept. His blood alcohol concentration was significantly over the legal limit for operating any kind of vehicle. These plans were in the works before the tragedy of Boake's death but he was in no condition to operate equipment, which he needed to do to remove manure to the manure pit and placed himself at risk. He was not the kind of young man to let an employer down by not showing up. Punishment should be mitigated by the defendant's lesser degree of culpability and he also had no prior record for safety violations. HELD: The fine portion of the penalty was to be paid to the Canadian Farmers' Disability Registry.  1) Having accounted for the mitigating factors that apply in this case, the guilty plea and the steps he has taken since the accident to improve safety at the farm, it was the worst news imaginable. Not only had there been an accident and farm work being inherently dangerous, accidents are daily risk, but the defendant had made substantial changes to his farm since the tragedy. He has made substantial improvements to the farm since August 2006, including building a new dairy barn and implementing a safer method for disposing of manure through gravity fed tightly spaced gratings that the defendant designed himself. 2) The defendant was responsible enough to show up for his job but he did not show up because he was not in condition to be operating equipment. His failure was in not arranging for an alternative to using the pit, alternatives that did exist at the time."
b_2017skqb81.txt,"HELD: The issues were determined as follows: 1) the applicant applied pursuant to The Seizure of Criminal Property Act, 2009, as that version of the Act was in place at the time of the seizure. The respondent argued that s. 35.1 did not apply at the time of seizure, because it was not in the Act at the time of seizure. The respondent argued that the two-year limitation period pursuant to The Limitations Act applied to the application with the date of seizure being the date of discoverability. The respondent also argued that the 2009 Act did not have retrospective application. The court found that the applicant applied pursuant to the 2009 Act and therefore the matter was assessed from that perspective. Section 35.1 of the 2009 Act required applications for forfeiture to be made within two years from the director becoming satisfied that the property sought to be forfeited was proceeds of unlawful activity or an instrument of unlawful activity. The court found that the words “Notwithstanding The Limitations Act” at the beginning of s. 35.1 served to provide an intention to prioritize the content of s. 35.1 over The Limitations Act. An affidavit filed by the applicant indicated that the director became satisfied that the property was an instrument of unlawful activity after August 2016. The director’s application was brought four months later, well within the two-year limitation period. The court then considered whether the 2009 Act had retrospective application and found that B. had the same legal position and faced the same jeopardy regardless of the version of the legislation, and therefore, there was no retrospective problem;  2) s. 7 outlined the test to apply. The court accepted the expert’s evidence with regards to the significance of the factors evidencing drug trafficking and how common they were to the drug trafficking trade. The applicant’s evidence also showed that the person alleging to purchase the truck from the respondent was not the purchaser and the purchase price was $8,000, not $16,000. The court found it more likely than not that the money was proceeds of unlawful activity; and 3) B. did not provide evidence or argument to support the exception that forfeiture would clearly not be in the interests of justice. The property was found to be proceeds of unlawful activity and the forfeiture order was granted.","This was an application by the Director under the The Seizure of Criminal Property Act for an order directing the forfeiture of $10,475.00 to the Crown in right of Saskatchewan. The property had been seized by the Regina Police Service from William Ross Butler in 2008. Since Butler filed notice of dispute in response to those proceedings, the Director applied to this Court for a forfeiture order pursuant to Part II. HELD: The application was granted. 1)The current legislative mandate reflected in the 2009 Act is prospective in operational effect and not retroactive. 2)The legislation is civil not criminal in nature and it is an in rem remedy. 3)There is no obvious or identified unfairness attached to the legislative change in relation to the triggering events or definitions, nor to the ultimate consequence."

HELD: The application was dismissed. The delay was not unreasonable.  1)The 25 months between when the charge was laid in May 1996 and the trial date in November 1998 was sufficiant delay to raise the issue of the reasonableness of the delay. Defence did not waive delay. 2)There was no reason given for the three and one-half month delay between the swearing of the information and the arrest. The accused's right to a fair trial had not been prejudiced by the total time delay. His right to security of person and to liberty were not affected. 3)Seven months delay was due to scheduling delays resulting from defence's application to remove prosecution counsel who had previously represented the accused. The Crown acted in good faith in opposing the application and had a meritorious position. 4)All other proceedings were within the systemic guidelines. 5)Prejudice to his liberty was minor as he was on bail since shortly after his arrest. He was able to make full answer and defence. He was employed throughout since his release. His inability to enter long term contracts or travel out of province would have existed for 21-1/2 months of the 25 month delay in any event. 6)Individual and family stress is to be expected. The minor prejudice beyond the normal and expected was not sufficient to outweigh society's interest in bringing those charged with criminal offences to trial.","FIAT. The accused sought an order for a judicial stay of proceedings pursuant to s24(1) and (2) of the Charter on the basis his right under s11(b) to be tried within areasonable time has been breached. HELD: The application was granted and the matter was adjourned to June 2, 1998 for a preliminary hearing. 1)The accused was on bail since shortly after his arrest. He agrees the delay has not resulted in a diminution of his ability to make full answer and defence. He has been employed throughout the period since his release. 2)Three months between the time the information was sworn and the accused's arrest could be considerably longer than the three months in this case."

HELD: The conditional provision was removed as time spent on electronic monitoring and post sentence efforts were considered. A conditional sentence was not available in the circumstances. The 38 year old had 49 prior convictions. The sentencing judge noted the accused's 3.5 years of sobriety, community support, education and technical trade training, and positive pre-sentence report but failed to consider the gravity of the offences, the need for deterrence, and above all, protection of the public. The respondent had no sooner finished parole than he began to commit these crimes.","The Crown appealed a conditional sentence of two years less one-day imposed on the respondent after he pled guilty to the following charges. The Crown appealed the conditional sentence imposed after his plea of guilty. HELD: The sentence was allowed. A conditional sentence was given to the Crown on the basis the respondent did not comply with a condition of his undertaking given to a justice or a judge and failing to comply with that condition, the Crown appealed. The sentencing judge noted the respondent’s alcohol problem, his three and one-half years of sobriety and that he did so well on probation he was released early at his own request in December 1999. She was of the view community disposition was likely to be more effective than incarceration at rehabilitating the respondent."
b_2000skqb36.txt,"The accused, Cote, applied for remedy pursuant to s.24 of the Charter of Rights stating that he was denied the right to be tried on a fraud charge within a reasonable time. Twenty-two months passed between the laying of the charge and the trial date. Cote was not responsible for the delay and actively pursued a speedy trial. The delay was caused by the Crown's failure to provide timely disclosure. HELD: The charge was stayed. In applying the decision of the SCC in R. v. Morin, the court found that 22 months is an unreasonable and exceptional period of delay and is of sufficient length to warrant an inquiry. This case had no particular complexity above the norm for cases of this kind and did not require this delay. Cote did not directly or indirectly waive his s.11(b) right to be tried within a reasonable time. Cote was subject to substantial and sufficient prejudice by the delay. He suffered damage to his political career, embarrassment from media reports, unemployment, and economic hardship. The court balanced the individual's right to be tried within a reasonable time with society's interest in having the matter proceed to trial despite delay. Here the defence was not seeking to delay the trial and use the protective shield of s.11(b)as an offensive weapon.","The accused was committed to stand trial on one of the fraud charges. He now applies to this court for a remedy pursuant to s. 24 of the Charter of Rights. HELD: The application is based primarily on the accused's position that he has been denied the right to be tried on the fraud charge within a reasonable time. The Crown has conceded its responsibility for the delay in this matter. It has attempted to explain the delay, but finds that the Crown has not been able to meet its obligations to provide timely disclosure. 1)The length of delay was substantial and sufficient to tilt the balance in favour of requiring a judicial stay. 2)The Court found that the inherent time requirements of the case require a 22-month delay from charge to trial. 3)There was no evidence that the accused had been prejudiced by the delay."

The appellant appealed the dismissal of her claim for negligent misrepresentation and the notice period for her wrongful dismissal. The respondent cross-appealed the damage award, claiming the trial judge failed to take into account the appellant's failure to mitigate. Appeal and cross-appeal, that the evidence supports the trial judge's findings, and he did not make any errors in law.","The appellant sought damages in an action for wrongful dismissal.

The respondent cross-appealed, claiming the five-month notice period should be reduced due to the appellant's failure to mitigate her loss. HELD: The appeal was dismissed. 1)The trial judge did not err in failing to properly apply the principles of negligent misrepresentation as set out by the Supreme Court of Canada in Queen v. Cognos. 2)The term in the contract providing for dismissal on notice was an effective disclaimer precluding any separate action in tort. 3)The appellant's claim was not that the appellant negligently misrepresented the amount of time she would be working on Multiview or the conditions under which his employment could be terminated. There is nothing in the evidence to support such a belief. The fact that the reality of employment with the respondent did not meet with the sanguine expectations of the employer does not constitute negligence."

2_2002nssc26.txt,"The accused, charged with fraud, brought a motion to stay the proceedings on the basis that his Charter rights had been violated by the RCMP and the Office of the Superintendent of Bankruptcy. The accused asked the court to reconsider its decision to quash a subpoena issued to the former Superintendent of Bankruptcy on the basis of testimony presented from other witnesses after the subpoena was quashed. Application dismissed; the accused had not met the onus on the balance of probabilities of establishing that the former Superintendent had relevant or material evidence to offer concerning the issues raised by the Charter motions. The subsequent testimony and documentation did not support the accused's allegations concerning the former Superintendent's motives or conduct.","The defendant brought motions (the Charter Motions) seeking a stay of those charges on the basis that his rights under the Charter of Rights and Freedoms were violated by the Office of the Superintendent of Bankruptcy and by the R.C.M.P. during investigations of his activities and of the administration of the bankrupt corporation. The defendant argued that the OSB, under the Superintendent, did not pursue investigations into other parties with sufficient vigor, and that the defendant somehow dissuaded the RCMP from investigating other parties' conduct and deflected suspicion of wrongdoing to him. HELD: The application was dismissed. 1)Nothing which has come before the Court since the Subpoena was quashed (or at any time) supports those beliefs expressed by the defendant. No likelihood has been established that Mr. Redling will provide any evidence concerning the investigation into the conduct of any other party which would be relevant or material to the issues raised by to the Charter motions. The Court's concern is about the investigation, and it has not been proven that any lack of vigorous investigation into activities of other persons involved in the NsC bankruptcy is likely to affect Mr. Black's rights with respect to the charges against him. 2) Nothing which has been before the court since the trial (or any time since the application was made) has supported those beliefs. There is no likelihood that any of the testimony and documentation presented since the submission of the affidavit supporting the defendant's belief that he was unlikely to provide any additional information concerning the issue raised by the CharterMotions.  3) Nothing has been shown to support those beliefs and the belief that the defendants were overzealous in their investigation of his conduct and that they did not encourage the RCMP to investigate other parties’ conduct. Nothing that has been seen by the Court has been supported by those beliefs or by the evidence given by the witnesses during the hearings. The court was not satisfied on the balance of probabilities that they were likely to have any additional insight into that issue.  4) The evidence which those witnesses gave and the documents to which they referred raise issues which warrant compelling the defendant’s attendance."
d_2009skqb517.txt,"Counsel for the plaintiffs brings two notices of motion seeking 1) the opportunity to cross-examine a deponent on her affidavit and 2) an order to compel one of defendants to supply pre-certification notices to all persons who may be eligible to participate in the class action that is contemplated. HELD: The motions are dismissed with no order as to costs.  1) One of defendants contends that 7 people alleged by the plaintiffs to be viable class members have already entered into a full and final settlement with the defendant. This defendant earlier sought to examine these individuals. The Justice of this action at that time did not allow the examination but instead made an order permitting the defendant to file affidavits on the issue. This is the source of the affidavit the plaintiff seeks cross-examination on. The order also allowed the plaintiffs to file reply affidavits, which they chose not to do. There is nothing in the original order that could be interpreted as saying that the plaintiffs could cross-examine on the affidavit. In the view of the Court, having chosen not to file reply affidavits pursuant to the original order, it is not reasonable for plaintiff's counsel to embark on a totally different approach several weeks after the deadline has passed. There is also some concern that the actual purpose of the proposed cross-examination would be more general and broad-ranging than a mere challenge to the defendant's assertion that the individuals at issue have already entered into full and final settlements with the defendant.  2) In its barest sense, plaintiffs' counsel requests that the defendant supply a plaintiff by way of sending pre-certification notices to its clients. The Court is aware of Lewis v. Shell, where an Ontario court ordered notice to potential class members. However, that case is not similar to this case. In the Lewis case, the Court was faced with concern over the defendant contacting individuals who might be potential class members for the purpose of obtaining early settlements. Moreover, the Ontario class actions legislation is less restrictive than Saskatchewan's. The section of the Class Action Act which may permit such an order refer to a 'class action,' not an 'action.' As this case is still in the pre-certification stage, it is not yet a class action within the meaning of the Act. Spavier v. Canada also indicates that pre-certification motions of this sort would rarely be successful in this jurisdiction.","The plaintiff brought a motion pursuant to s. 12 of The Class Actions Act for an order compelling the defendant to produce a list of proposed class members who had been provided with a letter and related package by the defendant (relating to a test of their premises for contamination). The plaintiff sought to have the defendant's counsel, Merchant Law Group, (MLG), examine the plaintiff on her affidavit. The affidavit was filed for the sole purpose of providing the evidence that the Roussys had settled with Red Seal and therefore could not be viable parties to this action. The plaintiffs opposed the motion. HELD: The application was dismissed. 1) This is still an 'action' only. The usual practices and application of the common law regarding civil litigation apply. The practices and the implementation of the Rules of Court do not get suspended merely because this matter has been brought under the Class Action Act. However, other decisions of this court have relied on s.12 to grant pre-certification orders. 2) The wording of s.14 and s.24 of the Act creates a concern about the suspension of time limitations. It is not in my view open to the plaintiffs make use of either section at this time. 3) The plaintiff brought an action against itself for failure to produce proper representative plaintiff. 4) The Court was not prepared to broaden the scope of Ottenbreit J.’s decision to allow for examination of the plaintiff. 5) The court was not able to determine whether the plaintiff should be granted leave to cross examine the defendant on an affidavit.  6) It was not necessary for the Court to get into the whole issue of examination of witnesses prior to certification. The Court would not be exercised in a manner that effectively renders remedial legislation redundant."
b_1995canlii5775.txt,"An application was brought under ss.58 and 59 of The Bankruptcy and Insolvency Act seeking approval for a proposal made by Gustafson Pontiac Buick. The proposal had received the necessary proportion of support from Gustafson's creditors. One unsecured creditor opposed the application. HELD: 1)Under s. 59(2), before it can approve a proposal, the Court must be satisfied; (a) that the terms are reasonable; (b) that the terms are calculated to benefit the general body of creditors; and (c) that the proposal is made in good faith. 2)In determining whether to approve a proposal, the court must consider not only the wishes and interests of creditors, but also the conduct and interests of the debtor, the interests of the public and future creditors and the requirements of commercial morality. 3)If, however, a large majority of creditors, i.e., substantially in excess of the statutory majority, have voted for acceptance of a proposal, it will take strong reasons for the court to substitute its judgment for that of the creditors. 4)Gustafson had met the criteria set out in the Act and the authorities referred to in Bankruptcy and Insolvency Law of Canada, and accordingly the proposal was approved.",This was an application pursuant to ss. 58 and 59 of the Bankruptcy and Insolvency Act for the approval of a proposal made pursuant to s. 50 of the Act by Gustafson to its various creditors. The trustee described GM and GMAC as 'franchise creditors' in his report to the unsecured creditors. HELD: The court found that the proposal was not a 'holding proposal' as it did not provide that all monies payable under the proposal would be paid to the trustee in accordance with s. 60(2)(d) of the bankruptcy and the requirements of commercial morality. The proposal was primarily calculated to benefit Prairie Security Fund and the guarantors of the secured creditors of the corporation and not the general body of creditors. No Oak Bluff appeared in opposition to the application for Court approval.
7_1996canlii7107.txt,"The respondent applied to reduce on-going maintenance from $600 per month for his two children and to reduce the accumulated arrears of approximately $14,600. The original corollary relief was made in 1989. An application for variation was dismissed in 1993 except that an order suspending the enforcement of the arrears during the times the respondent was unemployed was granted. The petitioner who had custody of the children and resided in Manitoba was employed. She requested that the matter be dealt with summarily on affidavit evidence and did not want a trial of the issue. HELD: The respondent was to pay $300 per month per child in the months when his gross earnings are $2,200 or greater and $150 per month per child when they are less. Arrears were reduced by $7,000. When he earned more than $2,200 per month he was to pay $200 per month on arrears in addition to the on-going child support obligation. The 1993 order was continued and it was further ordered that the respondent file quarterly a financial statement or cheque stubs evidencing his income with the maintenance enforcement office. 1)There was a significant reduction in the respondent's income since 1994, therefore there was a material change in circumstances. 2)The respondent had not provided specific information about the number of months he was in receipt of social assistance. It was clear, however, that his income during 1995 and 1996 did not allow him to meet his support obligations. Since his employment was uncertain a flexible order was appropriate.","The father applied to reduce the amountof on-going child support of $600 per month for his 2 daughters and to reduce arrears of approximately $14,600.

6_2002nssc288.txt,"The plaintiff was injured in a motor vehicle accident in Quebec and commenced an action in Nova Scotia. The applicant applied to determine whether the plaintiff was barred from suing in Nova Scotia concerning the Quebec accident and to dismiss the action on the basis that Nova Scotia was a forum non conveniens. Application to dismiss the action dismissed; the forum conveniens is Nova Scotia. The plaintiff has the prima facie right to select the forum subject to the defendant's right to establish that the forum is non conveniens. In the absence of many facts about the circumstances surrounding the accident and the witnesses likely to be called by the defendant, Nova Scotia is the forum conveniens. The substantive law governing the proceeding will be the law of the place where the accident occurred and the governing procedural law will be the law of the place of the trial.","The applicants applied for directions as to procedure to govern the future course of conduct of trial in Nova Scotia and, secondly, to dismiss the action for forum non conveniens that was refused. The court found that the applicants had a prima facie right to select the forum of his choice, but the respondent had not made any submissions of substance concerning forum conveniens and at the same time the applicants have not provided a lot of information about the circumstances surrounding the accident such as whether there were any witnesses and where they were located; whether the plaintiff was seen by doctors and if so, where they are located; what they might be called to testify at trial; if there was a procedural problem, a problem arising from procedural law, Nova Scotia is a forum. The applicants appear to have argued a determination of question of law, but have not really made any submission of substance regarding forum-non conveniens.

The court accepted the evidence of the accused where there was a discrepancy between the testimony of the officer and the accused. The mental element of the offence of refusal consists of intentional non-compliance. The officer in his conversation with another officer said he could not understand why he was not getting a proper sample. There was a reasonable doubt that the officer did understand why he was not getting a proper sample and could not provide the accused with adequate instructions.,The accused was charged with failing to comply with a demand made to him by a peace officer pursuant to s. 254(2)(a) of the Criminal Code to provide forthwith a sample of his breath as in the opinion of Cst. Rozario. The accused chose not to disclose in his disclosure information the name of the 'ride along' nor even that there was a ride along.

The evidence of the accused was accepted over that of the officer. The officer's cander in giving his testimony raised doubts in the mind as to his forthrightness in respect to other important details.

8_2007skpc1.txt,"The accused applies for relief pursuant to the Charter on the basis of post-charge delay denying her the right to have her trial in a reasonable time. HELD: There was a Charter breach and the appropriate remedy is a stay of proceedings.  1) The length of delay in this case from the date of charge to the date of trial is approximately 31 months. The Supreme Court proposed as a general guideline a delay of 8 to 10 months in Provincial Court as acceptable. This is consistent with the reality in Buffalo Narrows, where trials are set within 6 months of entering a plea. 2) 12 months of the delay can be attributed to the accused. 6 months was deducted from the delay for inherent time requirements in arranging for the accused's appearance in Court. The remaining delay of 13 months is either attributable to the Crown or caused by factors outside the control of the accused. 3) In this case the accused has suffered actual prejudice in that the delay in bringing this matter to Court from the time of swearing the Information to the date of trial has prejudiced the accused's ability to make full answer and defence and her right to a fair trial. While the restrictions on employment opportunities caused some prejudice, this could have been overcome by applications to amend her conditions of release. 4) There have been four trial dates set on these charges, resulting in a lengthy delay to a verdict being reached. No explanation is offered for the adjournments except for the last adjournment caused by bad weather.","The accused applied for relief pursuant to The Canadian Charter of Rights (the Charter) on the basis of post-charge delay denying her the right to have her trial in a reasonable time.

There were some delays attributable to her in time until she was ready to enter pleas, and later until she had the matter rescheduled for trial. 4)The weather caused delay from November 29, 2006 to January 19, 2007, period of 2 months.  5)Evidence was led by the accused that she suffered actual prejudice because the outstanding charge has affected her ability to apply for higher-paying job opportunities and has caused her stress and frustration.

The defendant is being sued by the plaintiff for damage caused to a construction site under a bridge in Saskatoon. The damage is alleged to have been caused when the defendant's truck left the ramp leading onto the bridge and fell into an excavation pit. The defendant argues that the City should be added as a third party because the City did not take proper steps to clear snow from the ramp, which provided a surface for his vehicle to launch off of. HELD: The application to add the City of Saskatoon as a third party was granted. The applicant has made out a prima facie case against the proposed third party. There is no prejudice to the plaintiff because he has settled with his insurer and is requesting settlement with the defendant's insurer. There is a causal connection between the cause of action plead in the statement of claim and the third party notice. It is immaterial at this stage that the City may have an absolute defence.","FIAT: This is an application by Saskatchewan Government Insurance on behalf of the defendant to an order pursuant to Rule 107A(c) of The Queen's Bench Rules and s.7 of The Contributory Negligence Act granting leave to the defendant, William J. Schmidt, to add the City of Saskatoon as a third party to this action. HELD: The application is granted as requested. 1)There is yet another ground on which the City is absolved from liability. The Supreme Court of Canada in Lewis recognized that it was entirely permissible for local authority to limit its liability. Section 154(1.1) of the Urban Municipality Act states that a city is not liable for damage caused by the presence, absence or insufficiency of any wall, fence, guardrail, railing, curb, pavement markings, traffic control device or barrier. No action may be brought pursuant to subsection (1) for the recovery of damages caused by any construction, obstruction or erection of any earth, rock, tree or other material or thing adjacent to or in, along or on a travelled portion of the street. 2)To refuse the application under s. of Contributory negligence would likely result in the requirement for a second litigation process to be commenced, that being by the defendants against the proposed third party claiming contributory negligence. This would to large extent create a legal process almost wholly duplicating that which is embodied in the litigation to this stage."
d_2010skca52.txt,"The appellant contests an order for $600.00 monthly spousal support given by a Chambers judge on an application to review a previous order which granted the respondent $300.00 monthly spousal support for a period of 1 year. The parties were married for 24 years following a 2-year period of cohabitation. They have 2 adult children, one of which is largely supported by the appellant. Both parties have some health problems. Originally, the appellant was ordered to pay the respondent $300.00 in monthly spousal support for a period of 1 year. Given the appellant's health difficulties and the fact that he was nearing retirement, the trial judge noted that the respondent would do well to become self-sufficient as soon as possible. The Chambers judge who reviewed the original order found that, during the year period the respondent was collecting spousal support, she had not engaged in any gainful employment. She had sold her house and used the proceeds to spend over 4 months living in Hawaii and Jamaica. She obtained probationary employment just after filing a notice of motion but lost the job before the hearing commenced. HELD: The appeal is allowed, the orders of the Chambers judge for spousal support and costs against the appellant are set aside. The Chambers judge imputed an income of $14,289 to the respondent on the basis that she was capable of working 30 hours per week at minimum wage. He did not indicate why he did not find her capable of full time employment. The Chambers judge made an error in calculating the income of the appellant. He also discounted the expenses borne by the appellant in relation the maintenance of their adult child, who was a full-time student. It was incumbent on the respondent to establish that she was unable to become self-sufficient. The evidence did not begin to establish that and, in fact, clearly showed that she made little effort to do so within the year allocated by the trial judge.","This appeal from a spousal support order was allowed orally from the bench for the reasons set out in Rimmer v. Adshead. It is clear that Ottenbreit J. set an order for fixed and short term in order to give the respondent an opportunity to find appropriate employment and become self sufficient. The evidence before the court established that during the year following the one year order, the respondent had not engaged in any gainful employment at all. She had sold her house and used the proceeds to spend over four months out of Canada, living in Hawaii part of the time and spending month-long vacation in Jamaica. Finally, she commenced employment in a probationary position after losing her position at a grocery store. The respondent assumed a substantial portion of her support during this time. HELD: Appeal allowed orally. 1) It was incumbent on the respondent on the review application to establish that she was unable to become a self sufficient person. 2) The evidence did not establish that the respondent made no effort at all within the year allocated by the court and prior to the filing of the notice of motion, and little effort between that time and the hearing of the application. 3) The respondent had made no efforts at all to gain employment. She did not have the means or financial ability to support herself and her two adult children. 4) The Court found that the chambers judge imputed an income of $14,289 based on the assumption she was capable of working 30 hours week at minimum wage.

SaskPower sought an order pursuant to Queen's Bench Rule 547 to require the plaintiffs to post security for costs on the ground Wind Power was a non-resident plaintiff with little or no assets in the province of Saskatchewan. HELD: The motion was dismissed.  1)Rule 547 is limited to cases where the plaintiff is a non-resident or where the defendant is given a statutory right to apply. Wind Power is an Alberta company extra-provincially registered in Saskatchewan. Dove Industries, a Saskatchewan company incorporated specifically to develop a pilot project in Saskatchewan which did not proceed, had shareholders in the province. 2)Given the amount of the claim against SaskPower in the amount of $6,400,000 and the significant claim for costs in excess of $50,000 the Court would have granted the security for costs but for the delay by SaskPower in bringing its application. The action was commenced in April 1996. Unexplained delay by a defendant in seeking security for costs will prevent the grant of an order. To make an award for security for costs at this stage would place a burden on the plaintiffs and possibly prevent the action from taking place at the scheduled time.  3)The plaintiff was awarded one set of costs in any event of the cause.","FIAT. The defendant sought an order pursuant to Queen's Bench Rule 547 requiring the plaintiffs to post security for costs in this action on the ground that it did not proceed with an application at an earlier stage of the proceedings as it wished to provide an opportunity at the pre-trial conference stage for the matter to be resolved. HELD: 1)There were appropriate circumstances to be considered to deny the defendant an order that the plaintiffs post security. 2)The plaintiff was advised of the plaintiffs position and held the matter in suspense before resorting to the present application. 3)Rule 547 is limited to cases where the plaintiff is non-resident, or where the defendant is given statutory right to apply.

e_2000skqb515.txt,"The Crown applied for an order forfeiting a vehicle pursuant to s.16(1) of the Controlled Drug and Substances Act. The registered owner applied for an order declaring her interest in the vehicle was not affected by any forfeiture order. The owner was passenger when 28.3 pounds of marijuana was discovered in the trunk of her Lincoln. She was found not guilty of trafficking and possession of marijuana for the purpose of trafficking. The driver was found guilty of possession for the purpose of trafficking. The trafficking charge against him was judicially stayed. HELD: An order of forfeiture issued pursuant to s.16(1). The application for relief was dismissed. 1)It was not necessary to address the Charter submissions with respect to s.19(3) because Crown counsel consented to the respondent's application being viewed as an application for relief from forfeiture under s.20. 2)It was impossible to conclude the respondent 'appeared innocent of any complicity' in the offence for which the driver was convicted and that she 'exercised all reasonable care to be satisfied' that the Lincoln was not likely to be used in the commission of the offence. 3)Section 11 of the Charter applies only when person has been charged with an offence. There was no charge against the respondent at this time. 4)The Act distinguishes between three types of persons who might own, or have an interest in, conveyance which is 'offence-related property': the interest of person convicted of the offence is forfeitable pursuant to s.16(1); if the person has been neither convicted nor charged and appears innocent of any complicity in the offence; someone charged with the offence which gave rise to the forfeiture application (as here). The forfeiture is not, except with respect to an offender, arbitrary. In view of the provisions available under the Act to obtain relief from forfeiture it cannot be concluded that empowering a court to grant an order of forfeiture constitutes cruel or unusual punishment.","The Crown applied pursuant to s16(1) of the Controlled Drug and Substances Act for an order forfeiting the Lincoln to Her Majesty in Right of Canada. HELD: 1) The Crown did not dispute the assertion by the owner that the Lincoln was within the definition of 'offence-related property'. 2) The court must first consider the gravity of the offence, the personal characteristics of the offender and the particular circumstances of the case in order to determine what range of sentences would have been appropriate. 3) The accused was the owner of the motor vehicle and there was some evidence that she may have had knowledge of the existence of the marihuana. She exercised all reasonable care to be satisfied that the property was not likely to be used in connection with the designated substance offence."
b_2008nspc5.txt,"The accused was charged with driving a motor vehicle while his licence was revoked when he was found operating an all terrain vehicle (ATV) on a highway. Accused found not guilty; the accused could not have obtained a licence to drive an ATV on the highway because it is a prohibited vehicle. Before one can be found guilty of this offence, it must be proven that they were driving a motor vehicle of a type or class for which they could have been properly licenced to drive on a highway.","The accused was observed by police officers driving his all terrain vehicle (ATV) along the community's highway. His driver's license was revoked and he was charged with driving a motor vehicle on the highway while his licence was revoked. The accused was convicted of driving a prohibited vehicle (U.S.A.) under s.11 of the Motor Vehicle Act and his charge was dismissed. The words'motor vehicle' in s. 287(2) do not include an ATV and even if those words did, the accused should be found not guilty because his license revocation is irrelevant since he could never have been licensed to drive an AT vehicle on a highway. The Crown argued that since there is no nexus between his driving of the ATV or the revocation of his driver's licence and the charge before the Court the accused was guilty of the offence. The defence argued that it was not that simple. HELD: The accused could be charged with an offence of operating motor vehicle (the highway) or for speeding and would be liable for the same penalties as the person operating an off-highway vehicle. The offence was not committed because his 'driver's license' was revoked; the offence was committed because the accused had not been properly licensed. 1)The word motor vehicle is used within the sections of the motor vehicle to determine whether the provision applies to the use of ATV's or other prohibited vehicles. When the content, context and purpose of section 287(1) is considered, the legislature intended for that subsection to prohibit the use by those individuals who had their licences or privilege of obtaining licences to do so cancelled, suspended or revoked. Before one can be guilty of such an offence find that it must be proven that they were driving a vehicle of type or class for which they could properly have obtained a license to drive a vehicle. In s.287(2), the words'motivator' and 'all terrain vehicle' include only those types or classes of vehicles for which one can obtain a licence to drive it on the road. It seems absurd to suggest that a lawfully licensed driver operating a properly licensed automobile or truck on highway could not be subject to the same obligations as a person operating off-way vehicle on highway."
b_1999canlii12595.txt,"The applicant applies for amendment of the judgment dated March 19, 1999 as it relates to costs. At the end of trial, the applicant requested the Court to reserve on the matter of costs. The applicant intended to make a submission for award of solicitor and clients costs. Evidence was led at trial about insubstantial offers made directly between the parties. Further evidence now indicates that substantial offers were made through council although not led at trial. The applicant argues that solicitor and client costs of $70,000 should be awarded because the offer to settle of $250,000 is close to the total judgment award of $230,000 including party and party costs of $20,000. The respondent takes the position that the estate was willing to pay reasonable maintenance costs and the quantum of maintenance could have been summarily determined without the necessity of extensive discoveries and without a lengthy trial. The respondent submits the approach of a needs-based assessment was upheld by the judgment and is always the approach always taken on behalf of the estate. The respondent argues the real question is whether the parties were acting bona fide during their negotiations and the issue should not be determined on the basis of the closeness of the offers. HELD: Solicitor and Client Costs of $70,000 are not appropriate in this case. The applicant's conduct was not entirely pure. The applicant was made aware in a prior judgment that under The Dependants' Relief Act there is nothing to indicate that a person is entitled to part of an estate as a beneficiary but rather that a beneficiary is entitled to maintenance. In spite of this ruling the applicant continued to claim the whole of the estate and to pursue full disclosure of the financial worth of the estate. Solicitor and client costs are within the discretion of the court but such discretion is exercise only in rare and exceptional circumstances. The conduct of the respondent cannot be characterized as reprehensible, scandalous or outrageous. The respondent's unwillingness to make full financial disclosure did contribute to the increase of costs but is insufficient to merit full solicitor and client costs. The Court awards fixed costs to the applicant in the amount of $47,000 together with disbursements.","The applicant applies for an amendment of the judgment. At the conclusion of trial, counsel requested that costs be reserved on the basis of Column IV, Schedule 1B of the Tariff of Costs. It is now clear that the applicant intended to make a submission for award of solicitor and client costs of approximately $70,000. Evidence was led at trial about insubstantial offers made directly between the parties. The further evidence now showed substantial offers were made through counsel although that evidence was not before the Court at trial. The applicant argued that the costs of the litigation were to be paid out of the award, the remainder may be insufficient to meet the applicant's anticipated needs. This argument cannot be accepted. The court has an inherent power to vary its own order so as to carry out what was intended or even to reconsider or withdraw the decision so long as the order has not been perfected. Rule 343A contemplates amendment of judgment in these circumstances. There is a substantial monetary difference between the party and party costs awarded in the judgment, and the applicant claimed the entire estate well past the time when it was appropriate. This contributed to the respondent's unwillingness to disclose the financial worth of the estate and prolonged the litigation and as such should be factor into the costs awarded. Rule 184C of The Queen's Bench Rules allows the court to take into account offers of settlement that do not meet the requirements of the court's rules in s.14A of the Rules in assessing appropriate costs."

The bankrupt contended that s241 of the Income Tax Act prohibits disclosure of tax information concerning both the bankrupt's common law spouse and the company of which she was sole director and shareholder. The second preliminary issue raised was that portions of an affidavit were based upon information and belief as opposed to personal knowledge as required by Queen's Bench Rule 319 for a final matter. HELD: A conditional order of discharge issued requiring the bankrupt to pay $1,750 from any source to the trustee by monthly installments of $100 per month. Judgment interest would accrue on any arrears.  1)This discharge hearing related to Nick Morin. The relevance of the tardiness in remitting goods and services tax of his common law spouse's company was questionable. The information was confidential and disclosure would be improper for these proceedings. The principle and exemption contained in s295(5)(a) of the Excise tax Act would not allow disclosure of goods and services tax remittances in these proceedings. 2)None of the alleged facts raised pursuant to ss173(1)(a),(b),(d),(f) and (m) were proved. It was not proven as outlined in s173(1)(f) that the bankrupt put them through unnecessary expenses by a frivolous and vexatious defence to the action. The conclusion of the investigation conducted by the RCMP as a result of the superintendent's investigation order was that the evidence would not support a successful prosecution.","Two creditors objected to the automatic discharge of the bankrupt, Revenue Canada and the bankrupt's common law spouse. The bankrupt argued that s. 173(1)(a) of the Income Tax Act prohibited the disclosure of information relating to the history of payments of goods and services tax. Revenue Canada argued that the information disclosed in paragraph 19 was confidential and would be improper for these proceedings. HELD: 1)The bankrupt's evidence was that it was their own fault he stopped making payments because they didn't do what he wanted them to do. The'my way or the door way' attitude is nothing more than bullying tactic used by the bankrupt to justify his failure to honour an agreement. 2)The court was not satisfied that any of the facts had been proved."

The wife's father had given her one rental property from which the rental proceeds went to the mortgage and into the parties' joint bank account; the husband was extensively involved in the operation of the property. This property was found to be a gift to the wife that became a matrimonial asset during the marriage as it was operated as a family venture. A second rental property was purchased by the husband and the wife's brother; the wife considered herself a partner in the venture even though her name was left off the deed. This property was also found to be a matrimonial asset.","The parties share joint custody of the three children. The parties agree that a Joint Custody Order shall issue and that primary care shall remain with the mother.

e_2014skqb23.txt,"Civil Procedure Injunction HELD: The first portion of the statement of claim is an attempt by the plaintiff to have the Court take jurisdiction over a matter that is already before the Saskatchewan Human Rights Tribunal. While the court has jurisdiction to hear human rights complaints, the jurisdiction only arises after the tribunal process has been exhausted. Since the tribunal procedure has not been completed, the portions of the statement of claim dealing with the human rights complaint are stayed on the basis that the underlying issues may only be heard by the court upon application of the Chief Commissioner of the Saskatchewan Human Rights Code pursuant to s. 29.6 of the Code. With respect to the claim that the defendant breached The Animal Protection Act, the essence of the claim is to seek damages against the plaintiff for the loss of the service dog. That portion of the claim must be struck because the plaintiffs cannot circumvent the provisions of The Animal Protection Act, 1999 nor eliminate the defendant’s right to be charged and tried in Provincial Court through the expediency of claiming a declaration in a civil suit. The third claim is that the defendant was negligent in allowing other children to interact with the service dog will not be struck because, assuming the facts in the pleadings are true, the claim for damages is viable. Likewise, the fourth claim that the defendant intentionally inflicted mental and emotional suffering on the autistic plaintiff will not be struck as is not plain and obvious from the pleadings that the claim cannot succeed. The plaintiffs’ application for an interlocutory injunction was dismissed because the claims that have not been struck are not rationally connected to the injunction, even assuming the remaining claims present a serious issue to be tried they do not justify a finding that the plaintiffs will suffer irreparable harm if the injunction is refused and the balance of convenience weighs in favour of not granting an injunction.","The plaintiffs applied for an interlocutory injunction to prevent the defendant from denying their provisional permission to attend a French language school for the 2013-2014 school year. The plaintiffs alleged that the defendant had discriminated against them because they had a service dog. HELD: The application was reserved and the court dismissed both applications. The court found that it was in the best interests of the plaintiffs' children to continue attending the school and that the court's decision was based entirely on the continuing failure of the Lawless family to honour their commitments. The Court found that s. 23 of the Charter gives it an exclusive and unfettered authority to decide whether it will admit any non-residents to an English school in Saskatchewan, and neither this Court nor the SHRC may inquire into its reasons or interfere with the exercise of its discretion."

The wife argued the agreement was not applicable to the present situation where they have separated and was only in effect during the time of the marriage or upon their deaths. HELD: The wife was entitled to judgment for $54,000. 1)There was no conflict in the evidence as to the verbal agreement made at the time of the marriage nor as to their intention. This is an appropriate situation to apply s.40 of the Family Property Act. The fact they each executed a will to give effect to that intention and the husband paid practically all of the day-to-day expenses led to the conclusion their verbal agreement should be considered binding, notwithstanding their marriage ended by separation rather than death. 2)The condominium purchased by the husband was the 'family home' as provided for in s.2(1)(a). There was no extraordinary circumstance as provided in s.22(1), which would prevent equal division of the value of the family home. The Melville residence owned by the wife at the time of the marriage was exempt in accordance with their agreement. It had not increased in value and the wife solely paid its maintenance. 3)No costs.",The petitioner sought an order for equal distribution of matrimonial property. The only evidence in writing of the parties' intentions was the respective wills executed shortly after the marriage leaving all of their assets to their respective children. There was no conflict in the evidence as to the verbal agreement they made at the time of the marriage.
6_2017skca42.txt,"Statutes – Interpretation – Limitation of Civil Rights Act, Section 2The appellants had granted a residential mortgage in favour of the respondent that secured a loan in the amount of $460,800. The loan was a consolidation of existing debt, part of which was the balance of $373,089 owed on the original loan that had enabled the appellants to purchase the land. The remaining $87,711 was non-purchase money financing approved by the respondent. The appellants fell into default, and the respondent commenced foreclosure proceedings when the balance owed had increased to $536,186. The property was sold through judicial listing orders and the net sale proceeds were paid to the respondent. As the proceeds were insufficient, the respondent sought an order entitling it to the deficiency. The Chambers judge considered s. 2 of The Limitation of Civil Rights Act (LCRA) and held that the amount of the deficiency should be $162,675.99. The issues on appeal were how the proceeds of sale should be applied against the mortgage balance and what the proper amount of the deficiency was. HELD: The appeal was allowed. The court reviewed the purpose and policy behind the LCRA. It then examined its conflicting decisions in Hrynewich Holdings and Andrews and held that the latter was a per incuriam judgment and therefore not binding and the approach set out in Hrynewich would guide the disposition of this appeal. Therefore, it found with respect to each issue that the holding in Hrynewich meant that payments should be allocated on a pro-rated basis to purchase money and non-purchase money debt balances and the proper amount of the deficiency to which the respondent was entitled to judgment against the appellants was $31,160.23.","This appeal concerns the application of s. 25 of The Limitation of Civil Rights Act (LCRA) in relation to a motion for deficiency judgment by the respondent bank. The main issue relates to how the proceeds of sale of property by judicial listing should be applied against a mortgage balance when there are both purchase money and non-purchase money balances. The issue on appeal revolves around the principles set out in Hrynewich Holdings. The Chambers judge considered s. 2 of the LCRA and held that the amount of the deficiency judgment should be $162,675. The portion of the loan attributable to the purchase of the land was 64.03% ($60,000.00 $93,700.00) and was credited against the $66,770.48 balance. At the time of the Chambers hearing, the appellant bank argued the trial judge was correct and that it was entitled to rely upon the land it held as security to recover the purchase money portion and then pursue Mr. Andrew on his personal liability to pay the non-Purchase money portion. The appellant argued the Chambers judge erred in his decision pro-rated the calculation pursuant to the percentage owing on both purchase and nonpurchase funds balances.  The appellant appealed the decision and sought determination as to the extent to which s.25 of The Saskatchewan Farm Security Act protects the debtor from an action on the personal covenant to pay a balance owing for mortgage taken in part to secure the purchase price of farmland. The Court found that the decision in Andrew (CA) was somewhat unusual in these circumstances, as this Court did not avert in Andrew the previous ruling in favour of the appellants. The appeal was allowed and the court reviewed the decisions of the chambers judge and the decision of the Bank of Montreal. The court concluded that the determination of the proper amount of deficiency judgment was determined by the Court of Appeal. It was instructive to note that the appellant respects the spirit and intent of the LCCRA and is the correct interpretation to be placed on that provision. The order below should be varied to entitle the respondent to take out a deficiency judgment against the appellant in the amount amount of $31,160.23."
