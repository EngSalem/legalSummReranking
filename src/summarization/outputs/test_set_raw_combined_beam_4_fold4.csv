3_2003skqb93.txt,"The company applied for an order granting court approval of a proposal made by its creditor pursuant to Part III of the Bankruptcy and Insolvency Act. A former 28-year employee objected on the grounds pension plan members should be treated as a different class of creditor rather than under the unsecured creditor classification ascribed to them by the proposal; the indemnification of past directors under the terms of the proposal was inappropriately wide. He submitted the unfunded pension liabilities constitute trust funds pursuant to provincial pension legislation (the Pension Benefits Act s.43(3)) and as such the pension fund claimants are entitled to preferred or secured creditor status. HELD: The Proposal was accepted.  1)Provincially created statutory trusts such as the one created by the Pensions Benefits Act are not recognized in bankruptcy including Proposals submitted under the BIA. The Trustee and the company acted appropriately in identifying the nature and status of the pensioners' claims. Although it might have reflected the status of his claim against the employer outside the BIA, the specific objection did not constitute a valid ground of legal objection to the Proposal. 2)The Proposal met the statutory and judicial criteria for acceptance by the Court. The Court takes into account the interests of the debtor, general body of creditors and the public at large in maintaining the integrity of the bankruptcy legislation. Of the 15 employees in the same position, 12 voted in favour of the proposal, 2 failed to file proofs of their claims; 89 percent of all creditors voted in favour of acceptance.  3)Each party was to assume their own costs of the hearing.","An insolvent person applied for an order granting court approval of a proposal made by it to its creditor (the 'W.R.T. Proposal'), pursuant to Part III of Division I of the Bankruptcy and Insolvency Act. The applicant opposed the approval of the applicant's proposal on the basis that members of the employee pension plan who have been classified unsecured creditors (by virtue of the Company's indebtedness for the unfunded portion of their pension plans) should beclassified in some other category of creditor. The Trustee made an application to the Registrar in bankruptcy for court approval. At the December meeting of creditors, 12 voted in favour of the proposal, 2 failed to file proofs of their claims and 1 opposed the proposal. HELD: The proposal was granted. The court ordered that the amendments be consistent with the provisions of ss. 50(13) and ss.50(13). Taking into account the concerns the applicant had raised by his objection and the submissions made on his behalf at the hearing of the application, the court concluded that the proposal did meet the statutory and judicial criteria for acceptance by the court. The proposed amended para. 9.1 was consistent with s. 50 of the BIA and it was ordered accordingly.  1)The court was much in sympathy with the concerns raised by the objection and those of the other pensioners who had proven claims. The trustee was appointed by the Company to act as trustee and the draft order filed may issue including the amendment to para. 8.1 of the Proposal. 2)The trustee's position in bankruptcy was better placed than that of an employer in identifying pension plan creditors by virtue of their status as creditors. The public-at-large in maintaining the integrity of bankruptcy legislation (including considering whether or not the proposal complies with standards of commercial morality). The court adopted the reasoning of Re Cosmic Adventures Halifax Inc. (1999), 22 C.B.R.(4th) 22 (N.S.C.C.) and Re McNamara & McNamara (1984) and it authorized the amendment of the proposal on this basis as clerical amendment. 3) Taking into consideration all of these interests the Court concluded in the circumstances reviewed and for the reasons outlined in this judgment that the Board concluded the proposed amended proposal does meet the requirements for the Court's approval."
1997canlii9869.txt,"The appellant was convicted of failing a breathalyzer test. The trial judge concluded on the evidence that the blood alcohol level at the time of the offence was different from the time of the offence, and found that the Crown could not rely on the presumption of identity. He ruled, however, that they could rely on the presumption of accuracy, and placed an onus on the appellant to raise a reasonable doubt on the whole of the evidence. The appellant appealed. Allowing the appeal and ordering a new trial, that the trial judge committed a fundamental error of law by ruling that when the Crown is forced to rely on the balance of the evidence, the accused must raise a reasonable doubt, a burden that clearly remains on the Crown.","This was an application for leave to appeal from a decision in the Supreme Court of Canada dismissing an appeal from the appellant's conviction under s. 253(b) of the Criminal Code. The Crown adduced evidence of breathalyzer readings of 110 and 120 milligrams. The appellant testified that he consumed five pints of beer during the course of the afternoon, the last shortly before being stopped by the police. In cross-examination the expert was asked to relate the readings shown by the tests to the alcohol consumed by the appellant. He stated that the readings were not consistent with the evidence of consumption given by the accused. The trial judge concluded that the blood alcohol level at the time of the test was different from the time the offence took place. The appeal was allowed and a new trial ordered."
c_2009skpc31.txt,"The accused, Chisum Log Homes and its sole director Gary Varga, are charged with operating a processing facility without a licence contrary to s. 18.1(1) of The Forest Resources Management Act. The accused corporation assembles log home packages. The packages are sold to customers across Canada. The accused corporation buys wood from area operators such as L&amp;M to be used in its packages. L&amp;M through its contractor P&amp;E, harvest wood from the forest and sell the wood to pulp mills, saw mills and other customers such as the accused. These area operators and their contractors have Forest Management Agreements and Forest Product Processing Facility Licences. In August and September 2007, the area operator L&amp;M delivered logs to the accused. The accused took additional steps to prepare the logs for inclusion in their log home packages which they sold. The accused does not have a Forest Product Processing Facility Licence. The issue in this case is whether the Crown has shown that the accused requires such a licence. HELD: 1) The definition of 'manufacture' in the Act is extremely broad as it says, 'means any step taken'. Given this definition is not difficult to find based on the evidence presented that the steps taken by the contractor in cutting the logs is more than simply harvesting as it is defined in the legislation. See R. v. Provincial Forest Products, 2000 SKQB 371. 2) The Court is satisfied that the accused corporation, Chisum, took steps to manufacture the forest product for the log home market. Steps such as debarking were steps taken in the manufacture of a forest product for market.  3) Given the wide definition it is the Court's view that many facilities, including a retail lumberyard, could be captured within the definition. Given the stated purpose of the Act, it is appropriate that the requirement for a Processing Facility Licence be restricted so that it does not apply to every entity that manufactures a forest product. 4) The processes Chisum is involved in encompass the substantial conversion of the forest product into logs to be used in the log home industry. The process is not insignificant, nor is it a process which is removed from the sustainable use of forest lands and the need to maintain and enhance the health of forest lands. The Court concludes that Chisum was required to have a Processing Facility Licence. 5) Pursuant to s. 81 of the Act, Gary Varga, as President of Chisum, is also guilty of violating s. 18.1 of the Act.","The defendant, Chisum Log Homes and Lumber Ltd., did operate a processing facility without a licence contrary to s. 18.1(1) of The Forest Resources Management Act, F-19.1. The defendant was the President and sole Director of the company. The company assembles log home packages in the Weyakwin district north of Prince Albert. These packages are sold to customers across Canada and around the world. The defendants purchased aspen logs from Wood Products (1985) Ltd., a Wood Products contractor. Wood Products, through its contractor, Logging (referred to as P E) harvest wood from the forest in and around Glaslyn. They sell this wood to pulp mills, saw mills and other customers such as the Chishum Logs. The defence argued that once the logs reach the company, they have already been processed and to require the company to have a processing licence is unnecessary. The court found that P & E Logs did not have a Forest Product Processing Facility Licence. HELD: The Court found that the defendant and the plaintiff were found guilty of violating s. 17.2(1)(a) of the Act. The Court held that the defendants were involved in the manufacture of the forest product for the log home industry and that the creation of the chisum log was a processing and must require a processing license. The accused were found to have entered into an agreement to supply the defendant with the necessary materials and equipment to process the logs. The agreement stipulated that the accused would be required to register their processing facility with the Ministry of Environment pursuant to a Forest Products Management Act (FPMA). The Court noted that the definition of'manufacture' in the Act is extremely broad as it says 'any step taken'. The process is not an insignificant process, nor is it removed from the sustainable use of forest lands and the need to maintain and enhance the health of forest land. The issue in this case is whether the Crown has shown that the corporation requires such a licence."
d_2001nssc85.txt,"The applicant was aware that allegations of abuse had been made against him in an alternative dispute resolution process undertaken by the Province with respect to his former employment. He applied under the Freedom of Information and Protection of Privacy Act for certain information concerning these allegations. The FOIPOP Privacy Coordinator denied access and the applicant appealed. Appeal allowed; in all cases where the claimants had signed release forms the applicant is to be supplied with information as to the number and nature of allegations made against him and the names of the complainants; the specific dates and times of all allegations made against him; the evidence collected in relation to the investigations undertaken as a result of the allegations; the number and dollar amount of payouts made for actions attributable only to the applicant; and information as to whether any of the allegations leveled were dismissed or unproven. The appeal should proceed as an appeal de novo. The applicant was not seeking information from R.C.M.P. files and the release of information which the police had passed on to the Department of Justice would not harm law enforcement as the information was compiled by the Province for its own purposes. The complainants had been required to execute releases whereby the information supplied could be used for various specified purposes, all of which potentially involved public disclosure or disclosure to the applicant. Law enforcement protection was lost when a release was obtained from the complainants and the information was passed to the Province. There was no unreasonable invasion of the claimants' privacy. The applicant was entitled to know what he had been accused of and should have the right to correct the record.","The appellant had made an application pursuant to the provisions of the Freedom of Information and Protection of Privacy Act for information about the Department of Justice's (Department of Justice) counter-terrorism program. At the beginning of the investigation, the respondent was given certain 'can say' statements by former residents of the institutions. He filed his final report in 1995, which was based on the conclusions of the Stratton report. The following year, the inspector general appointed under the Justice Minister appointed by the appellant to investigate the allegations of institutional abuse in the institutions for youth correction and protection. The inspector general recommended that the Justice Department provide the respondent with a summary of all of the allegations made against him, as well as recommendations on how to achieve that objective. The recommendations were based on information from the Department's own internal investigation and were not made lightly. The administration of the justice department did not accept the respondent's recommendations. The respondent retained Facts-Probe Inc. to conduct further interviews to obtain information for employee discipline, possible criminal prosecution and ultimately to process insurance claims. In the spring of 1996, the ADR process was temporarily suspended to allow the province an opportunity to review and modify the process. During this time, approximately 40,000 statements were made, mostly by the respondent, although some were made by others. In some cases, the statements were actually signed by people who had been involved in the investigation. In others, statements were given only to the respondent. The extent to which the various roles of the R.C.M.P. and Department of Community Services became meshed and interchangeable is clearly set forth in paras. 11-33 of the affidavit of Inspector Atkins. The appeal is taken from a decision of Robert Doherty, Freedom of information and Protection under the Act, which appointed a review officer pursuant to s. 41(1) of the Act. In this case, the appellant was granted access to the information requested. Throughout the course of the application and in an expeditious fashion, he was denied information about some of the individuals who had made the allegations, some of whom were still under investigation, and some unnamed third parties, through counsel, have also resisted disclosure as requested."
b_2013skqb407.txt,"HELD: The Court held that the cause of the damage was high humidity in the building caused by water leaking into it from the roof. The failure of the tenant to maintain the floor caused approximately 25 percent of the damage to the floor. The estimated span for the flooring was 20 years. As the lease was in good standing at present and would expire in 2018, the age of the floor at that time would be 17 years. The Court awarded to the landlord the amount of $836, which was 25 percent of 3/20 of the damages claimed. The business loss claimed by the tenant was $4,800. Thus the net setoff owing by the landlord to the tenant was $4,800 less $836. The defendant tenant was awarded costs of the three-day trial of $2,500.","The plaintiff landlord claims damages against its tenant, the defendant, asserting negligence by failing to clean, wax and polish the vinyl tile floor in the building, thereby permitting moisture to penetrate between and underneath the tiles resulting in lifting and cracking.

He denied there were any arrears. 2)The respondent wife did not have any desire or desire to participate in activities with the children. 3)An agreement was reached in 1989 in accordance with paragraph 2(c) of the 1989 judgment reducing the maintenance from $1,200 per month to $500 per month.

b_2000skqb420.txt,"FIAT. An application for summary judgment under Part Forty. In issue was whether a solicitor is bound by an undertaking to protect an expert witness for its professional fees. The defendant solicitor, who represented several farmers and farming companies in suits brought against Saskatchewan Crop Insurance Corporation on a contingency fee basis, confirmed in writing in 1993 that his office would undertake to protect the plaintiff consultants for their fees and disbursements and to pay interest at a rate of 12% per annum. The plaintiff was hired to provide technical evidence as to crop losses and damages the farmers claimed as a result of actions of SCIC. When all of the claims were dismissed at trial, the solicitor rejected the plaintiff's demand for payment arguing he had no obligation to pay as the farmers' actions had not resulted in the recovery of any monies. The plaintiff sued the solicitor in 1997 for professional fees of $37,604.33. The plaintiff objected to certain portions of the defendant's affidavit. HELD: The plaintiff was awarded $37,604.33 plus interest at 12% per annum as provided for in the undertaking, and costs of the action.  1)The plaintiff commenced its action under the general rules but amended its claim without objection to continue under the Simplified Procedure. 2)Portions of the defendant's affidavit were struck as being hearsay and opinion or related to matters immaterial to the proceeding.  3)The applicant's admissions at discovery did not confirm the interpretation of the undertaking set out in the statement of defence. It was obvious the plaintiff's officer recognized the farmers were intending to fund their costs from a settlement or judgment and that disbursements, including the costs of any expert's reports commissioned by them or the defendant, would be paid by his clients regardless of the outcome of the suits. 4)The only conclusion that could be drawn was that defendant guaranteed payment of the applicant's account regardless of the outcome of their mutual client's actions. A solicitor is presumed to know the cannons of the Law Society including c.XVI, comm.10 of the Code of Professional Conduct with respect to undertakings. The solicitor's undertaking in 1993 was absolutely clear. The addition of the word 'protect' put the question beyond doubt. His inquiry in 1997 made it clear the defendant recognized his responsibility and was hoping for some resolution of the applicant's account.","FIAT. The defendant represented several farmers and farming companies in suits brought against the Saskatchewan Crop Insurance Corporation (SCIC). The plaintiff was hired to provide technical evidence as to crop losses and damages the farmers claimed resulted from the actions of SCIC. The plaintiff's officer was employed by the farmers on contingency basis, the understanding being that the clients would pay the defendant's disbursements in any event. HELD: The court was struck. The respondent was not bound by an undertaking to protect an expert witness for its professional fees. The court had an opportunity to hear both parties in this action on evidence in chief and under cross examination. It was not an appropriate case under the simplified procedure. The portions of the affidavit were not evidence but hearsay and opinion. The addition of the word protect puts the question beyond doubt. The only conclusion that can be drawn from the facts is that the respondent guaranteed the payment of the applicant's account regardless of the outcome of their mutual client's actions. Although the respondent may have sympathy for the respondent but he is presumed to know the canons of the Law Society."

Finding the defendant solely at fault, that evidence from the accident reconstruction as to the angle of impact supported a conclusion the defendant was travelling faster than she realized and was inattentive. Damages were set as follows: impairment to hearing in left ear assessed at $8500, damage to left knee assessed at $2500. Exacerbation of a pre-existing back condition which produced consequences in the severe range was assessed at $31,500.","The plaintiff suffered a concussion, hearing loss in his left ear, neck injury and knee injury. He was taken to hospital by ambulance to hospital. The flare-ups of pain since the motor vehicle accident had been more severe than those prior to the accident.

During his employment as professional truck driver, the accused had driven into construction zone on highway and hit another vehicle that had been stopped. The three teenage occupants of the vehicle were killed and flag person was severely injured as result of the collision. The accused was sure that he had not been asleep at the time of the accident but felt that he had not been paying attention. He had not noticed any of the signs posted at 100-metre intervals after the start of the construction zone 1.6 km south of the accident. The accused was 41 years of age. He had obtained his A-1 driver’s licence in 2009 and had clean driving abstract. He was married and had three children. He had recently been diagnosed with mild sleep apnea. He expressed remorse to the victim’s families and suffered from post-traumatic stress disorder.| HELD: The accused was sentenced to three years in imprisonment on the first count and three years concurrent for the second and third counts, and one year concurrent to the other counts on the fourth count. He was prohibited from operating a motor vehicle for five years and from possessing a firearm for 10 years after his release from imprisonment. The aggravating factors in the case were that the accused’s inattentiveness caused the death of three people and severely injured another person. The impact of the children’s deaths was devastating on their families. The accused was a professional driver and capable of exercising more skill and vigilance, especially when he was operating a semi-trailer truck in a construction zone. The mitigating factors were that the accused pled guilty and expressed profound remorse. He had not been drinking and had a clear driving record. The accused was at low risk to re-offend.","The accused was charged with three counts of dangerous driving, one of which related to his failure to recognize stopped vehicles in an active construction zone. The accused had been charged with operating a motor vehicle in a manner that was dangerous to the public and caused the death of three young boys. The Court was of the view that the accused's inattention for whatever reason had caused the accident resulted in his being struck by a semi-trailer. The impact on the three boys was so severe that one of the boys, who was standing near the driver's side of the vehicle, suffered a broken collarbone, a broken left collarbone and a fractured left clavicle. The injuries sustained by the driver were those of the two boys who had been killed in the collision. The defendant was sentenced to six years imprisonment in federal institution, with a 10 year driving prohibition and a $1,000 victim surcharge for $800 payable forthwith and in default eight days consecutive to the six-year sentence. The aggravating and mitigating factors in the case were not considered by the Court because the defendant had no previous driving record. The Criminal Code requires that all sentences must be just and fair and consistent with previous judicial decisions in this jurisdiction, if at all possible. In dangerous driving cases, however, denunciation and deterrence play a significant role in maintaining public confidence in the administration of justice. These past two years have been particularly difficult on the families of the victims as they have been through so much pain and suffering."
b_1999canlii12533.txt,"The primary issue was the appropriate parenting arrangement for the two children. The 1997 interim order awarded joint custody with the primary residence with the mother and reasonable access to the father including alternating weekends, reasonable telephone access and equal sharing of holidays. The father initially failed to pay child support as ordered then paid $250 per month rather than the $424.72 ordered. The parties no longer communicated directly with each other except by e-mail so that there was a record. HELD: 1)It was in the best interests of the children that their primary residence be with their mother. She had demonstrated greater flexibility and sensitivity to their needs. The father was granted access two weekends out of every three and additional time as they may agree upon. Although both were very good parents the parties had not demonstrated an ability to co-parent effectively as illustrated by their communication problems. The father's access initially went beyond the minimum required by the interim order. He failed to make support payments as ordered. The father was to pay child support of $449. Pursuant to s.7 of the Federal Child Support Guidelines he was to pay 54% of the net cost of child care expenses incurred as a result of the mother's employment and for health related expenses in excess of $100 of the insurance reimbursement upon production of receipts.  2)The automobile constituted matrimonial property and was valued at $200. 3)Either could speak to costs.","The parties resided at 2335 Ottawa Street, Regina, until their separation August 31, 1997.

During the first 2 months of the separation the children spent alternate weeks with each parent. The petitioner was the primary caregiver and the respondent's access went beyond the minimum required by the interim order. Both parents were responsible for the lack of communication and ultimate inability of the parties to show more flexibility. HELD: 1)Both parents were to have interim joint custody of the children. 2)The petitioner was to have reasonable telephone access with the children and access at such other times as the parties may agree. The father was to pay child support of $31,800 per month. 3)The parties were to work on improving their communication and parenting in the best interests of their children. They were both very good parents. It was unfortunate that they could not demonstrate an ability to co-parent more effectively. The children were close to their paternal grandparents. Their conduct indicates a lack of sensitivity at times, on the part of both parents, to the needs of each other."
c_2011skqb100.txt,A judgment issued from the Court along with a writ of execution. The plaintiff discovered that one of the defendants had shares being held at the defendants' solicitor's office and instructions were given to the sheriff to seize and sell the shares. The sheriff attended to seize the shares but the defendants' lawyer objected. At issue was whether the legal office could refuse to hand over the shares to the sheriff pursuant to a solicitor's lien and whether the shares were exempt from seizure pursuant to the Saskatchewan Farm Security Act. HELD: The law firm was ordered to produce and deliver to the sheriff the shares of the defendant in the third corporation; costs were fixed at $750. 1) The right of the law office to refuse to produce and deliver the shares to the sheriff had not been made out and court process was thwarted. There was no evidence to determine the amount owing from the defendant or the third corporation for legal work; a valid solicitor's lien was not demonstrated. 2) There is a difference between the seizure and sale of shares in a company and the seizure and sale of a piece of farmland and the argument that the Executions Act or the Saskatchewan Farm Security Act restricts the seizure fails.,"FIAT: The applicant seeks an order from the court requiring the legal office of the sheriff to produce to the sheriff of the Judicial Centre of Prince Albert, the shares owned by Jensen in Jen-Sim Cattle Co. Ltd. pursuant to the June 5, 2001 writ of execution. The solicitor's lien arises out of s. 66(3) of The Legal Profession Act, 1990. The sheriff has the power to seize and sell the shares in the name of Jensen. He has not pledged, hypothecated, sold or encumbered the said share certificate which would require them to be delivered to any third party in accordance with any obligations or encumbrances he may have placed against the same company. There is no restriction in the Executions Act nor in the Saskatchewan Farm Security Act. The only claim against the shares within the company is the plaintiff's claim as creditor. It is on this principle that the solicitor has a lien as a creditor. In this case, the argument that the receiver cannot have rights greater than those of the client vis-à-vis the solicitor cannot be sustained. The claim for lien is not made out. HELD: The court held that the end result of the seizure and sale of Jensen's shares will be sale of farm lands. That leave of the court must be obtained. The court declined to refuse the shares to the receiver. 1) The solicitor has no better right to retain documents than his client would have if they were still in possession of them. He knows of no legal obligation between himself and the plaintiff whereby he is required to deliver up to the plaintiff his Class 'A' Common, voting shares. 2) The portion of the affidavit that was used to determine the amount owing by the plaintiff was uncontroverted. There was nothing before the court that even remotely suggests that the client is not not the owner of the shares. The defendant has no greater right to refuse production and delivery of documents than is his client's when faced with the right of third party to require production of the documents. 3) The court did not consider a valid solicitor’s lien to have been made out on the part of the applicant."
c_2002nssc30.txt,"The borrower in a mortgage foreclosure action counterclaimed against the lender and joined the insurer of the mortgage and experts he had retained for advice in the development on the basis of negligent misrepresentation. During discovery of the borrower's former solicitor it was revealed that the solicitor may have given the borrower a warning that the financing arranged was inadequate. No privilege was claimed during the discovery process. The defendant brought an application for production of the solicitor's files and a copy of the borrower's employer and bank records intended to show his familiarity with business and financial affairs. Application allowed in part; solicitor's files with respect to terms of solicitor's retainer and non-legal advice or services are to be produced; employer's and banker's records not to be produced. The claim of negligent misrepresentation raised the question of reliance; evidence of knowledge would go to the borrower's state of mind and the solicitor's warning, if timely, would be relevant. The conduct of the borrower's present counsel in making no objection at the discovery amounted to waiver. There were no special circumstances existing with respect to the employer's and bank's records; the applicant made no effort to obtain the records until too late and the documents would have little, if any, relevance.","The plaintiff sought to insure the mortgage with Canada Mortgage and Housing Corporation (CMHC) through its mortgage insurance program.

The documents sought were found to have at best tenuous relevance. Lee objected to the use of solicitor-client privilege. He argued that the plaintiff had put his state of mind in issue by pleading that the bank relied on information given by the solicitor to him. The defendant counterclaimed that the documents sought, and indeed all of the plaintiff's evidence, ought to be excluded.HELD: The application was dismissed with costs to the plaintiff. 1)Lee knew of the privilege as it had been expressly addressed prior to the discovery and was to be disclosed. 2)The plaintiff was aware of the solicitor's position for period now approaching three years. His counsel had not advanced any information which would lead the Court to believe that there had been any exceptional circumstance which would justify granting the necessary leave to obtain the documents.  3)The documents sought appeared to have been produced voluntarily. The documentary evidence may possibly clarify those terms. In the event that the defendant's advice was outside the terms of his retainer then the advice may not have been within the meaning of the rules. 4)The applicant's counterclaim was found to be a violation of the equitable principles of fairness and consistency. 5)Although the plaintiff was a 'neighbour' to the defendant, the defendant knew of his obligation to rely upon the plaintiff and that his obligations were to be paid in full. 6)Credit was due to the bank for all the necessary preparation and preparation for the construction and financing of the project. The loan was secured against a mortgage by the defendant and the plaintiff retained the services of a Kentville lawyer. The discovery proceeded without objection. 7)There was no evidence to support the claim that the loan was negligent."

HELD: The chamber's judge was in error in striking out portions of the statement of defence and counter-claim. The error consists of a failure to address the merits of the application. The Court of Appeal opted to deal with the merits of the application themselves, rather than remitting the matter back to Queen's Bench. While the allegation of fraud might have been pleaded more explicitly, the pleading is nevertheless sufficient to answer the requirements of QB Rule 173. The appellants should have been given an opportunity to amend their pleadings. The appeal was allowed and the application to strike was dismissed without prejudice to respondent's right to seek further particulars.",HELD: The appeal was allowed and the application to strike was dismissed. The court found that the order by the chamber judge striking major portions of the statement of defence and counterclaim was made in error.

7_2005skqb272.txt,"FIAT: The applicant school division asks for a vesting order regarding an un-subdivided parcel of land. The requested relief cannot be granted unless the court has authority to order that a subdivision of land be effected outside the requirements of The Planning and Development Act. HELD: 1) Even if this was a proper case for the making of a vesting order, there is a further difficulty presented by the fact that the applicant school division is asking the court to order that a subdivision be effected, as a pre-condition to the vesting order. Whether under the former legislation or the present, the court is not free to subvert the statutory requirements in the exercise of its authority to make vesting orders. The court reviewed the relevant caselaw. 2) While the court is precluded from directing the Registrar to effect a subdivision that is prohibited by the legislation, a resolution of the matter could be achieved if, for example, after adjudicating on all the rights and obligations at issue, the Court was prepared to direct that the pre-conditions to subdivision approval be met by a party to the proceedings. Once the proposed subdivision meets the required standards and is approved, then a vesting order can be made in the appropriate circumstances under the provisions of s. 6.5 of The Land Titles Conversion Facilitation Regulations, or under The Improvements Under Mistake of Title Act. The court reviewed the applicable caselaw. 3) The court requested that further written submissions be provided by the parties on the matter of directing a trial of the issues.","FIAT: The applicant school division asks for a vesting order regarding a presently unsubdivided parcel of land owned by the respondent. The applicant asks for an order directing the Registrar of Titles to register the Plan of Proposed Subdivision with respect to Parcel G and to issue a Transform Approval Certificate. The requested relief cannot be provided unless the Court has authority to order a subdivision of land outside the requirements of the Planning and Development Act, 1983. The issue arises in a rather complex fact situation. In 1994, the School Division's predecessor (the Kerrobert School Division) sold land to purchasers (the Flads). The transfer was registered, however the reservation of the farm site could not be registered because it purported to effect an unauthorized subdivision of the land. The Flads filed a caveat to protect their interest. The trial judge ordered rectification of the agreements and directed the defendants to apply for subdivision approval. HELD: The appeal was allowed. The orders made in the foregoing cases can only be determined on a full examination of the evidence and not in summary fashion. The Court was obliged to prevent such wholesale frustration of the legislature's objects. The original transaction appeared to have been concluded in an effort to avoid compliance with subdivision regulations, rather it was made in a mistaken belief that an already subdivided parcel was being transferred. As the school division and the Episcopal Corporation were in occupation of the proposed parcel, they failed to obtain development permits before making improvements to the site. The subsequent difficulties were of their own making and not solely ascribable to the mistakes of title. However, it is not within the Court's power to order the Registrar to effect subdivision contrary to the provisions of The Improvements Under the Mistake of Title Act. The application in question was whether the Flads retained a legal interest in the land which could form the basis of a registrable transfer under The Land Titles Act."

The petitioner had previously been ordered to pay $1,000 in costs to the respondent but instead paid the $1,000 directly into the child's credit card balance and there was no evidence that this was done by mutual agreement between the parties. The child was not performing well in her program with no explanation for her poor performance. HELD The burden is on the petitioner to prove the adult child's ongoing economic dependence. Although the child is a child within the meaning of the Divorce Act during the time she was attending classes, her expenses are excessive. The child provided no evidence to rebut the respondent's information that she did not attend many of her classes.

Since the defendant was an uninsured motorist, the Facility Association defended the plaintiff's action against him; however, the plaintiff also brought an action against the insurer of a motor vehicle policy under which the deceased was insured. At issue was whether the Section D provisions of the deceased's insurance policy extended to cover the plaintiff. The deceased's insurance policy does not provide coverage to the plaintiff as the emotional harm suffered by her was simply too remote from the obligations contemplated by the contracting parties.","The plaintiff, a cousin of the deceased, commenced an action to recover damages for emotional injury as a result of the loss of a motor vehicle accident. The defendant was an uninsured motorist at the time of the accident. She was present although she did not suffer any physical injuries and was not directly involved. She commenced this action to advance a claim for nervous shock. It was admitted that the Plaintiff was entitled to recover the nervous shock from the Defendant. The Plaintiff did not participate in the trial and has no interest of the outcome, the Facility Association and Wawanesa having together settled her claim. The Court found that such a claim was not the result. The emotional harm suffered by the Plaintiff is simply too remote from the obligations contemplated by the contracting parties. Section D provisions of the M/V insurance policy issued by the defendant extend to protect an 'insured person' under the contract.

In the first matter, the final bill was rendered and the applicant had a lengthy opportunity to raise the issue. There will be no extension of time for the first bill. The second bill is different in that the applicant disputed the amount of the bill when he first received it. He was advised that the bill would be adjusted.

b_2011nsca39.txt,"The police responded to a call from a woman identified as the defendant's girlfriend's mother to the effect that her daughter was being abused. Initially unable to locate the residence, they spoke to the girlfriend on the phone, who advised them that she was fine and did not require the police. They nevertheless continued to the residence, where they heard a scream from inside. Knowing that the defendant was a suspected drug dealer and potentially violent, they demanded entry into the home. The daughter opened the door and told them everything was fine, there had been no assault and she had simply wanted a ride home. From where they entered, the officers could see a person lying down in the bedroom. They approached the man, searched him for officer safety and then conducted a warrantless search to locate any other occupants. During the search, certain items were noted that caused them to obtain a search warrant, following which drugs were found. The defendant's argument that the search was illegal was unsuccessful as the court found that, in these particular circumstances, the police had a responsibility to enter the home without a warrant, do a pat down search of the accused and search for other occupants. Once drugs were seen in plain view, they proceeded to obtain a search warrant. Judicial notice was taken of the fact that complainants in domestic situations often recant due to threats of coercion by their partners. The defendant appealed. Appeal allowed; conviction set aside; although a violation of the defendant's Charter rights had occurred, the record was insufficient for this court to engage in a s. 24(2) analysis. Although it was reasonable, in the circumstances, for the police to search for the girl, go to the defendant's home and not simply leave once she told them she was fine, the trial judge erred in failing to consider alternatives short of police entry (such as conferring with the girl after they had her step outside and close the door) and the search of the home, without a warrant. Police authority to investigate such a call includes locating the alleged victim and determining if their assistance is required, but, without more, does not extend to the entry or search of the premises.","The appellant appealed his conviction for breach of s. 8 Charter rights by the police entry and search of his home without a warrant. The police had entered the appellant's home after hearing a scream from inside the home. The appellant argued that the call to the police was not a 911 call or distress call but rather a search of the premises. He also alleged that the police were not justified in entering the home to ensure that there were no other occupants and to search to ensure he had no weapon. Appeal allowed; conviction set aside.

b_2008skqb182.txt,"The tenant appeals the decision of the Hearing Officer granting her landlord a possession order of her rental premises. The tenant received notice of the hearing late on Friday when the hearing was set for Tuesday morning. She immediately requested an adjournment as she was unable to attend personally. The tenant also submits that the notice failed to disclose a significant aspect of the complaint, namely the conduct of her boyfriend. HELD: Appeal allowed and the matter returned to the Director to schedule a new hearing with at least 7 days clear notice to be given of the date. The decision to grant an adjournment is inherently discretionary and should be made with a view to what is necessary to ensure justice is done between the parties. This should include consideration of the complexity of the issues, the tenant's personal circumstances affecting her ability to attend in person on short notice and any prejudice to the landlord if the request is granted. There is no evidence that any of this was considered by the Hearing Officer. Three days (including a weekend) is not sufficient time to make arrangements and prepare for any hearing. It is clear that the tenant took the matter seriously and spent considerable time preparing written responses to the landlord's claim as she knew it to be. On the issue of sufficiency of the Notice, the Court found that while the Notice outlined many issues, it failed to disclose issues relating to her boyfriend. Since these issues were only discussed at the hearing the tenant was unable to attend she was not able to advise in person or in writing that her boyfriend was now incarcerated and the issue resolved. The Hearing Officer, in accepting evidence from the landlord about the boyfriend when neither the Hearing notice nor the landlord's complaint contained notice of it, breached the rule of natural justice and due process. The reasonableness standard of review applies here.","The tenant appeals from the decision of the Hearing Officer granting the landlord possession of her rental premises. This self-represented tenant included, as grounds of her appeal, 'procedural violations' and'misinformation as to the purpose of the hearing'. HELD: The tenants request an adjournment so that she can make arrangements to personally attend the hearing. 1) The three days notice given to the tenant was insufficient to allow her to make arrangements. 2) The hearing notice was not properly considered by the hearing officer. 3) The tenant took the process very seriously and spent a considerable amount of time preparing a written response to the landlord's claim as she knew it would be difficult for her to attend. She did not ignore the process.  4) The court found that both the failure to properly consider and grant the tenant the applied for adjournment in the particular circumstances of this case and failure to provide the tenant with the particulars of the landlord’s claim constitute reversible errors."

Awarding the plaintiff $285,000 out of the $3 million estate, that under the Testator's Family Maintenance Act the claimant need not show actual or urgent need or true dependency in order to succeed. To justify interference with a will a court must find a failure to provide proper maintenance and support and a moral claim to entitlement. The court must consider the magnitude of the estate, the circumstances of the claimant, the strength of his or her moral claim to a share in the estate, and the situation of others having claims upon the testator. This involves a very broad judicial discretion. Here, the plaintiff had established a strong moral claim and a failure to provide proper maintenance.","Two separate actions were commenced following the death of Rajbir Sandhu, a medical doctor who had been awarded his LL.M from Yale. The third was commenced by Gurpreet Sandhu who claimed to be the wife of a doctor and sought entitlement to her late husband's estate by 1998. Following certain pre-trial communications among counsel and discovery examinations of important witnesses, it became obvious that there were circumstances surrounding the doctor's death which might reasonably be considered suspicious. Several procedural agreements were reached. The residue of the estate was to be divided, with the remaining 65 percent to go to the residuary beneficiaries.

4_2004skqb19.txt,"The applicant applied by originating motion for a declaration that the respondents, Zurich and Sovereign, were obligated to pay a proportionate share of defence costs to defend a claim brought against the applicant. The underlying action claims damages from the applicant with respect to the construction of a hog barn. The applicant was the general contractor. Each of the respondents issued a comprehensive general liability policy to the applicant. The law is clear that the pleadings determine whether or not the respondents have a duty to defend. If the claim alleges a state of facts, which would fall within the coverage provided by the policy, the obligation of the insurer to defend is triggered. The Court reviewed the claim and concluded that the true nature of the claim was that the applicant failed in its contractual duty to construct and deliver a hog barn suitable for the purposes intended. HELD: The application was dismissed with costs.  1) It is a fundamental principle of insurance law that a comprehensive general liability policy is not intended to be a means for a contractor to cover the expenses to correct its own faulty or defective workmanship. They are not performance bonds. 2) The claims in negligence are inseparable from the claims in contract and do not exist but for the contractual relationship. 3) The insuring agreement provided for the payment of all sums the applicant might become legally obligated to pay as compensatory damages because of property damage caused by an occurrence, which was defined to mean an accident. What is alleged in the underlying action was not an accident or occurrence. Further, the work/product exclusion clauses in the policies relieve the respondents from any duty to defend.","The applicant applies by originating a motion for a declaration that the respondents are obligated to pay a proportionate share of defence costs to defend a claim brought against them by Genex Swine Group Inc. (the 'underlying action'). The applicant takes the position that under the policies they issued they are not obligated to defend and to pay defence costs for the claims brought against Westridge and others in the underlying action. HELD: 1) The first premise for assessing whether an insurer's duty to defend has been triggered rests in the traditional 'pleadings rule'. Whether an insurer is bound to defend it has been conventionally addressed by relying on the allegations made in the pleadings filed against the applicant. 2) The mere fact that Genex alleges both negligence and a breach of contract is of no moment sufficient to change a claim by reason of an exclusion under the policy. 3) The second premise is to determine whether the statements of claim is properly pleaded. The onus of establishing that the terms of the policy obligate the insurer to defend rests with the applicant, not the insurer. 4) The third principle is articulated in Alie v. Bertrand Frère Construction Co. (2002), 222 D.L.R. (4th) 687, where Wallace J. stated that it is only in the nature of a pleadings that the insurer becomes legally obligated to protect. It is only where there is genuine ambiguity or doubt as to the claim that is resolved in favour of the insured. 5) Occurrence 'Occurrence' includes continuous or repeated exposure to conditions which result in loss neither expected nor intended from the standpoint of the Insured. This principle is congruent with the broader tenets underlying the construction of insurance contracts, namely the contra proferentem rule, and the principle that coverage provisions should be construed broadly, while exclusion clauses should receive narrow interpretation. 6) The insurance policies in the case covered negligence but did not cover intentional torts such as sexual battery. 7) The defendants entered into a contract with the plaintiff which included the use of the Galvalume alternate. The plaintiff cannot change an intentional tort into a negligent one simply by choice of words or vice versa. The second principle is summarized in Bacon v. McBride (1984), 62 O.R.(3d) 551. The defendants were negligent and breached the contractual and other duties owed by them to the plaintiff. 8) The liability imposed by the insurance policies is a three step process followed by courts."
1998canlii13585.txt,FIAT. Exclusive possesson and ownership of the matrimonial home was granted to the petitioner in May 1998. At the time of the trial they were leading separate lives but under one roof as neither would vacate the home. Given the respondent's age (77) the court did not want to specify a date that he had to move from the home. He had not left the home and the matter was scheduled to be heard June19/98. In the meantime a notice of appeal of the judgment was filed on behalf of the respondent. At issue was the interpretation of ss(1) and (4) of s15 of the Court of Appeal Rules. The respondent's counsel took the position that with the filing of the notice of appeal this court became functus. The petitioner argued the order for exclusive possession is an injunction and therefore is not stayed by the notice of appeal. Alternatively that the giving of directions as contemplated by the judgment itself would not constitute the taking of any 'execution of the judgment' or the taking of any 'further proceedings in the action' and therefore would not contravene Rule 15. HELD: All applications should be made to the Court of Appeal as the matter was now before that court. No case law could be found in support of either party. It was unnecessary to decide the issue as to whether Rule 15 operates to stay an order of exclusive possession.,"FIAT. The parties were married for over 25 years and were now senior citizens. Although the court had ordered that the petitioner was entitled to exclusive possession of the matrimonial home, it wanted to specify a reasonable time period for the petitioner to move from the home. HELD: The petitioner was granted exclusive possession. The Court was prepared to provide directions. 1)Rule 15 of the Court of Appeal did not stay the execution of the judgment or an order awarding mandamus, an injunction, alimony or spousal support for a child or a adult adult. 2)The issue resolved around the interpretation of two conflicting rules: 15(1) which provide that the service and filing of notice of appeal is not stay if the judgment is stayed pending a disposition of the appeal; and (4) Rule 15, which bars the giving of requested directions. No caselaw in support of the position of either could be found. The issue as to whether Rule 15 operates to stay an order of exclusive possession was raised in Young v.

That order had been made pursuant to s. 242 of The Planning and Development Act and required the respondent to comply with the zoning bylaw by desisting from operating an equipment storage yard on a parcel of land owned by him and to restore it to the condition it was in prior to his use of it. The respondent had purchased the land in 2009 and immediately began storing equipment and leaving junk cars and other materials on it. The applicant had tried to encourage the respondent’s voluntary cooperation with the bylaw but eventually issued the order. After the court granted the order, the respondent took no steps to comply with it and in August 2014, the applicant applied for an order declaring the respondent to be in contempt of court. The application was heard in September at which time the respondent submitted by affidavit that he had removed the old cars but believed that he was allowed to keep his equipment. He requested that he receive additional time. The respondent was given until December 2014 to comply with the order. At the hearing he deposed that he had spent a significant amount of time and money removing materials from the land and that he had found out from his counsel that his belief regarding the permitted use of the land was incorrect. Based on the appearance of the site, the applicant was not satisfied but agreed to adjourn the matter until May 2015 as nothing could be done during the winter. When the matter was reviewed in May, the respondent had removed more equipment but said that he was not able to move it all as he had no place to put the rest of it. The applicant requested that the court find the respondent in contempt and to impose appropriate penalties, authorize it to remove any remaining machinery and to add the costs of this removal and disposal to the taxes on the land and to make an order for solicitor-client costs in its favour. HELD: The respondent was found to be in contempt of court pursuant to Queen’s Bench rule 11-16(3) for his failure, without reasonable excuse, to comply with the terms of the May 2014 court order. The court authorized the applicant to remove and dispose of the equipment if the respondent had not done so within 30 days of the order issued. The court awarded solicitor-client costs to the applicant in the amount of $15,000 because of the respondent’s continued and unjustified failure to comply with the zoning bylaw. As the applicant might incur additional costs to remove the equipment, those costs would be added to the tax rolls of the property and become payable by the respondent if he had not purged his contempt within the allotted time.","The respondent was granted an order pursuant to s. 242 of The Planning and Development Act requiring him to comply with an order of the Development Officer of the Rural Municipality of Edenwold to comply within 60 days with a request to restore a parcel of land to the condition it was in immediately prior to undertaking the development. The respondent took no significant steps to comply and, despite numerous court appearances and preparation and payment of solicitor and client costs, remained in contempt of court. The court was satisfied that the respondent had not substantially complied with the orders nor had he provided any reasonable excuse for his failure to comply, for his repeated failures to complete the purging of his contempt, and for his inability to provide appropriate legal fees and disbursements to the applicant. The contempt application was therefore adjourned to February 2, 2015, being the next closest date after the issuance of the order. Contempt proceedings are not for punishment per se, but for upholding the rule of law and respect for court orders. HELD: The court ordered the respondent to pay $15,000.00 in contempt costs and ordered him to appear in court on the issue of the contempt application. The Court was also concerned that any additional financial sanction may be more akin to punishment than a sanction."

Both acknowledged that they were aware of the nature and effect of the agreement and each had independent legal advice before signing. The husband paid periodic spousal support until December 1995. The applicant sought to vary the 1993 order on the grounds there had been a change in circumstances in that her annual income was currently less than half of what it had been at the time the order was made and her economic hardship could be traced to the breakdown of her marriage primarily because his job had required them to move from place to place during the marriage.

The application was to be determined upon s.56 of the EMOA and whether it would be grossly unfair and inequitable to refuse the application. 3)The maintenance order constitutes a charge upon the land and the applicant obtained title to the land subject to that charge.

HELD: The plaintiff's amended claim can proceed to trial. The court is prepared to strike the portion of the defendant's action as frivolous or vexatious. Even if the plaintiff could prove the debris in his yard was solely from the defendants' trees, this would not be sufficient. The issue is whether this is a case involving the law of private nuisance. Private nuisance is generally described as unreasonable interference with an occupier's use and enjoyment of their land. As rule damages are awarded where roots damage property either by falling onto it, breaking it or hanging over it and causing damage. Damages are not awarded for trivial annoyances. There is nothing in the pleadings to suggest that the burden on the plaintiff is greater than expected for the community he lives in. There are two areas of concern: seed pods, fuzz and other debris fall from the trees in significant amounts during the summer months and during the winter months; branches from the defendant’s trees grow over the property line and intrude into the plaintiff space. A tree branch from one of the defendants’ trees may be seen as a nuisance, although the plaintiff said at this time there were many other trees within the residential area so it was impossible to demonstrate that the debris was from the others."

8_2012skqb249.txt,"The accused was convicted of aggravated assault after stabbing another person several times in the mid-section. The Crown brought a dangerous offender application. The accused was 22 years old at the time of sentencing. His prior criminal record consisted of mostly youth convictions. The offender was a known member of an aboriginal gang. The evidence suggested he was somewhere in the middle of the gang hierarchy. The accused had professed some desire to leave the gang. He had written an article directed at other youth warning them of the pitfalls of gang affiliation. The article was published in a book distributed to at risk youth. The accused had looked into getting help to leave the gang, but admitted on the stand that he was not prepared to take steps to leave because he might need protection from the gang in the penitentiary. While incarcerated, he had gang drawings confiscated from him and he had been jumped by members of a rival gang while in custody. The accused had shown some initiative in taking anger management courses and had completed his GED while incarcerated. HELD: The offence was a serious personal injury offence within the meaning of s. 752 of the Criminal Code. The criminal record together with the evidence heard at the hearing establishes that when the accused has committed violent offences he has been under the influence of alcohol or drugs, under supervision by court orders in the community, has used a knife or had one in his possession and most of the offences were a result of the accused's affiliation with the Indian Posse gang. The Crown has established a pattern of repetitive behaviour within the meaning of s. 753(1)(a)(i). Dr. Holden assessed the accused and found him to be a high risk to re-offend violently. The Crown has also proven that the accused constitutes a threat to the life, safety, and physical or mental well-being of other persons as set out in s. 753(1)(a)(ii). The accused was declared a dangerous offender. However, the Court found that given the accused's youth, the fact that he had not had any of the intensive programming that is available in a federal institution and the fact that there was some chance the accused might leave the gang, a determinate sentence and long term supervision order would adequately protect the public. In imposing a determinate sentence, the Court also considered that the accused's acts of violence, with the exception of the predicate offence, had generally resulted in less than severe injuries to the victim and the accused had voluntarily taken some steps to address his issues while incarcerated. The accused was sentenced 6 years or 72 months in custody, less credit for remand, to be followed by a 9 year supervision order under s. 753.4(b).",The accused was found dangerous offender within the meaning of s. 753(1)(a)(ii) and he should be sentenced to an indeterminate sentence. The Crown called thirteen witnesses who provided evidence about the accused's prior criminal convictions. HELD: The Court found that the accused was guilty of aggravated assault contrary to s. 268 of the Criminal Code and of breach of an undertaking contrary to S. 145(3) of the Code. The predicate offence was a serious personal injury offence. The Court held that the evidence did not meet the statutory requirements of a dangerous offender designation and that long-term offender designation was the appropriate finding with a term of imprisonment from four to eight years in penitentiary for the predicate offence followed by a lengthy supervision order toward the statutory maximum. There was no indication of violence to others.

Humboldt's security interests were acquired pursuant to a security agreement granted in 1996 on present and after acquired property as amended in 1998 to specifically include the trailers. It also applied for an order giving directions respecting the exercise of the rights of the secured party with the prior interest. At issue is what is meant by 'possession' in s.34(2)(a) and when Lake Air obtained possession or constructive possession of the trailers. HELD: The application was allowed with costs from Humboldt.  1)The parties filed an agreed statement of facts and focused on the priority issue as if the application had been brought under s.66. 2)'Constructive possession' means possession of the collateral by 'another person at the request of the debtor' as set out in s.34(2)(a). What constitutes 'possession' of collateral by the debtor within s.34(2)(a) was in dispute. Unless the property qualifies as 'collateral' a person cannot possess it as a 'debtor' within the meaning of the priority section. 3)The case law in Saskatchewan has interpreted 'possession' to constitute more than mere physical possession. Sections 22 and 34(2) of the new Act are essentially unchanged except for the addition of the constructive possession. S.22(2) restricts the scope of constructive possession somewhat but it applies only to s.22 not to s.34. 4)A person is not in constructive possession of collateral within s.34(2)(a) unless that person is a 'debtor' as defined, unless the collateral is 'collateral' as defined and unless another person 'obtained physical possession of the colateral at the request of that debtor'. 5)The first term of each lease agreement contained an acknowledgement by Lake Air that the trailer was delivered by Associates at the date and location set out in the lease. Such a clause is inconsistent with Lake Air having actual or constructive possession at an earlier date. Lake Air did not have constructive possession prior to December 1997 through either Bell or Mid-Canada. Neither was in possession of the trailers at the request of Lake Air.  6)The protection the Act gives to purchase-money security holders should be interpreted broadly. To deny Associates priority over Humboldt would provide Humboldt with an unmerited windfall at the sole expense of Associates who gave full value for the purchase-money security interest it obtained from Lake Air.","The respondent applied under s.63 of the Personal Property Security Act for an order declaring the priority of competing security interests held by the respondent and Humboldt priority over that of its security interests in two reefer trailers. HELD: The application was allowed. It was ordered that its purchase money security interests be priority over the security interests of the respondent in them.  1)The issue to be determined was what is meant by the term possession in s.34(2)(a) and when, in thecircumstances of this case, Lake Air obtained possession orconstructive possession of the trailers within the meaning of the priority section.  2)The respondent did not become debtor in possession until the terms of the lease were met and the security agreement was executed.  3)Although each of these cases were decided under the former Act, sections 22 and 34(2) are essentially unchanged except for the addition of the concept of constructive possession which is not directly addressed in the section. The term 'possession' in these sections is not necessarily equivalent to bare physical possession. In the circumstances of the case before me, to deny the respondent priority over Humboltt would provide the purchaser an unmerited windfall at the sole expense of Associates who gave full value for the purchase-money security interest it obtained from Lake Air. 4)The applicant was ordered to pay full value to the respondent.  5)The application is allowed. The application is denied. The case law in this province has not as yet interpreted the constructive possession terms of either section 34(1) or section 22. These terms were not contained in either s.21 or s.33 of the previous Act. 6)There is no dispute that the time within which the buyer must be a debtor begins to run from the date the debtor acquired possession of property in the present and after acquired property as amended in January 1998 to specifically include the trailers. The respondent is a debtor as defined by the Act. 7)The evidence convinces the Court that the term possession in the Act is non-existent. It is obvious that before December 22, 1997 the trailers were not in the physical possession of Lake Air until it agreed, on November 2, 1997, to accept the debt. The first term of each lease agreement contained an acknowledgement by Lake Air that the respectivetrailer was delivered to it by Associates at the location and on the date set out in the lease.

5_2018skqb209.txt,"Contract Law – Sale of Land – FormationReal Property – Sale of Land – Oral Contract The plaintiff brought an action against the defendant for specific performance and damages. The plaintiff claimed that the defendant agreed to sell him three quarters of land. The defendant’s position was that there was no agreement and if there was, it was not in writing as required by The Statute of Frauds. The plaintiff made this application for a resolution of the initial question of liability as to whether an agreement was created and if it was, then proof of damages would follow. The plaintiff argued that a contract was created and that it complied with the statute because he made his offer in writing, via an internet-based land auction program, and the acceptance was orally communicated by a telephone conversation. Therefore, all the requisite elements of a valid land sale were present. The defendant had used a website to list 17 quarters of land for sale, including six quarters of relevance to the action. The website was intended to connect sellers of farmland with interested buyers in a type of “non-binding auction” to permit sellers to gauge interest in their land, find the best possible price and avoid realtor’s commissions if a sale were completed. The listing showed three groups of the farmland for sale, described as 1) three adjoining quarters (the subject quarters); 2) two quarters (the adjacent quarters) and 3) one quarter (unsold quarter). In his online comments to the defendant during the auction, the plaintiff said that he wanted all five quarters (the subject and adjacent quarters). The plaintiff bid on each of the above parcels and had the highest bid on the subject quarters, but that in itself did not guarantee the purchase under the terms of the online auction program. He stopped bidding on the adjacent quarters because he thought they were becoming overpriced. After the auction, the plaintiff consulted with family members regarding whether to pursue negotiations with any of the bidders. They discussed the problems that would occur if the subject quarters were separated from the adjacent quarters because the two blocks were owned by different individuals. The defendant then telephoned the plaintiff and gave him two package options for the sale, both of which resolved the identified problem by including the purchase of the adjacent quarters. The package options were to purchase the subject and the adjacent quarters for $1,050,000 (which was 5 percent more than the $625,000 the plaintiff offered for the subject quarters and his last bid of $375,000 on the adjacent quarters) or the subject quarters and one of the adjacent quarters for $840,000. At the end of the conversation, the plaintiff testified that he wanted to be sure that regardless of his response to the package option offers, he would be able to buy the subject quarters for $625,000. The plaintiff did not have concerns about the purchase because he said that the defendant told him that “we had them”. He believed that this indicated the defendant’s willingness to accept his bid on the subject quarters and that if he accepted either of the two options, then either of the newly accepted offers would replace the agreement respecting the subject quarters. The defendant’s interpretation of the conversation was that he declined to accept the offer on the subject quarters until he heard back from the plaintiff respecting the package options and then he would decide whether or not he would sell the subject quarters. He either misheard or misunderstood the plaintiff’s question about the subject quarters and denied that he gave any assurance that he would sell them to him regardless of his response to the package offers. The plaintiff called the defendant shortly after the first conversation and advised that he would not accept either of the package option offers but would immediately bring the deposit for the purchase of the subject quarters. The defendant told him to “hold off”. The plaintiff interpreted that to mean that there was no urgency regarding the deposit rather than that no agreement existed respecting the subject quarters. The defendant testified that he said he was not prepared to accept the deposit at this time, which meant that he was not prepared to accept the plaintiff’s bid on the subject quarters. Three days later, the defendant emailed the plaintiff and said that he would not be accepting the bid. The issues were: 1) whether a contract was formed; 2) if so, did the Statute of Frauds apply.  HELD: The plaintiff’s action was dismissed. He had not established on a balance of probabilities that he and the defendant were parties to a valid and enforceable agreement of sale regarding the subject quarters. The court found with respect to each issue that: 1) there was no contract. In interpreting the words of the first telephone conversation and the context of the bidding process, using the standard of the reasonable bystander, there was no consensus ad idem between the parties. The second telephone conversation had done nothing to alter that finding. Both the plaintiff and the defendant reasonably believed different things; and 2) the Statute did not apply as there was no contract.","The plaintiff and defendant were involved in a lawsuit regarding the sale of three quarters of land in the Rural Municipality of Hazel Dell. Both parties agreed that the application of the Statute of Frauds to the land sale agreement was an additional requirement to the usual essential elements of a valid contract. The plaintiff alleged that the offer was in writing via the exchange during the internet-based land auction and the acceptance was orally communicated via telephone. The defendant alleged that after the bidding process closed, the plaintiff agreed to sell the land to the highest bidder respecting the Unsold Quarter, which he later claimed was not in writing. The issue was whether the agreement was enforceable. HELD: 1) The plaintiff must prove on a balance of probabilities that a contract was created between the plaintiff and the defendant respecting the Subject Quarters and that the formalities of the statute of frauds have been satisfied. 2) The first telephone conversation was only brief minutes, probably even seconds in duration. The germane portions of the conversation were all that the plaintiff could gather. Proof of damages will follow if the court finds that an agreement was created.  3) The second telephone conversation, which lasted less than five minutes, is all that could be said to have created a contract of purchase and purchase of farm property. The central issue in this case is the application by the defendant to the package offer. The second phone conversation, in which the plaintiff stated that he would not accept the defendant's offer respecting the subject quarters but that he offered to bring the deposit on the adjacent quarters for $1,050,000. The court accepts that the defendant gave the plaintiff's daughter and son-in-law an assurance that the items would be sold to him and that he was not obligated to accept the bid on the other quarters. 4) There are numerous explanations for how things went wrong in the understanding between the parties, other than the inaccurate and dishonest testimony of any of the parties."
9_2009nsca91.txt,"The young person appealed his sentence on an aggravated assault conviction following a drive-by shooting and applied for release pending appeal. Although he alleged that he would suffer unnecessary hardship if kept in custody because he would fall behind in his schoolwork, prior to being remanded the youth had been asked to leave his high school as a result of safety concerns in the school. Application for release pending appeal dismissed. The young person would not suffer unnecessary hardship as he was able to attend high school classes several times per week in the youth facility while he awaited his appeal and, even if his appeal was successful, he would only have served four months custody before it was heard. Given the circumstances of the aggravated assault and his record of violent offences and numerous breaches of court orders, the court was not persuaded that the youth's release would be in the public interest.","The accused, a young person, pleaded guilty to aggravated assault contrary to s. 268(1) of the Criminal Code. He was sentenced to 365 days, comprised of 243 days custody followed by 122 days supervision in the community. The victim of the shooting applied for release pending appeal. The accused appealed his sentence, arguing that his incarceration was so long that, by the time his appeal was heard, he would likely already have served more than what is determined to be a fit sentence, and thereby suffer undue hardship if he is not released. Application dismissed; the onus is on the appellant under s. 679(4)(a) to be'much more stringent' than for an appeal against conviction; given the circumstances of the aggravated assault offence, his record of violent offences, and the numerous breaches of court orders, releasing the accused would cause unnecessary hardship. The program described by the respondent could provide much closer supervision than J.E.S. has had in the past, and would not cause undue hardship."
e_2009nssc318.txt,"The mother applied for retroactive support (table amounts and s. 7 expenses) for two adult children. The father resisted the application in relation to the oldest son on the basis that he was no longer a dependant child when it was filed. The evidence showed the son finished university before the application was filed. His graduation took place after, at which time he was already working full time and living with his girlfriend. He lived with his mother for few months because of relationship problems, but later moved back in with the girlfriend. He also received some assistance from his parents when he took time off work to retrain. The father felt the mother's application in relation to the younger son should be limited because of her unreasonable delay in making it. He argued retroactivity should be limited to three years from the date he received the application (months after it was filed). The mother argued formal notice was given when her lawyer sent a letter requesting additional support several years earlier. She asked the court for support retroactive to three years before that date, or longer (based on what she alleged was blameworthy conduct on the father's part). The evidence showed the mother was slow in responding to the father's request for particulars. Despite threatening legal action several times, it took her years to file the application. The wife's application for retroactive support in relation to the oldest son dismissed. He was no longer a child of the marriage when it was filed. He became independent when his schooling finished and he started working and living with his girlfriend. While his parents provided assistance during his relationship troubles and retraining, they did so voluntarily and not out of any legal obligation. Support for the younger son to be reassessed retroactive to three years from the date the application was filed (as opposed to received). The mother unreasonably delayed her claim by allowing it to languish for years. While normally the letter from her lawyer would be said to constitute effective notice, the notice here was voided by the mother's failure to prosecute the matter. The father did not engage in blameworthy conduct: he made efforts to respond to and settle the mother's claims; he paid a significant level of support; and he reasonably believed he was meeting his obligations. Here, the need for certainty for a payor parent weighs in favour of the father.","The parties were married for 22 years and had two children, one of which was born in the course of their marriage. The respondent applied to vary the date for which retroactive child support should be paid for the younger child, arguing that the court did not have jurisdiction to grant any relief respecting the older child because the older was not, at the time of the application, a child of the marriage. Respondent takes issue with the respondent's claim for retroactive support and s.7 expenses for the parties' older child. The issues raised by the petitioner's application to vary are retroactive review of the base table amount of child support paid by the respondent and the Respondent and the contribution to the section 7 expenses of the children. HELD: 1)The respondent's application was allowed. The court did have jurisdiction on the issue of the first issue; the court's jurisdiction to deal with the claim for retrospective child support and retroactive adjustment to the contribution Mr. Munro must make to the sections of the child support payable in timely manner. 2)The issues raised were whether the court had jurisdiction to make a retroactive order for an adult child, whether the Court should be prevented from enforcing an unfulfilled child support obligation, and 3)whether the trial judge should be limited in his or her discretion to consider blameworthy conduct. The parties' children clearly left the charge of their parents in April 2008. He established an independent household without the consent, agreement, approval or financial support of his parents. He did not seek any of these from his parents when doing so. The proper approach was to consider the alternative issue of recalculation of all child support payments and s7 expenses.  4)The court held that it would be appropriate to apply the Farden Factors to the determination of post-secondary education expenses to be paid by each of the parties."

The mother was mentally competent and able to manage her own affairs at all times prior to her death; the Power of Attorney was granted solely for the mother's convenience as she was physically infirm. The daughter could only be called upon to account for her use of the Power of Attorney if it was used when the mother was incapacitated.","The plaintiffs sought an accounting from their sister of her dealings with their mother's financial affairs pursuant to a Power of Attorney. The plaintiffs were five of the five children of Bessy Wright who died in August 1999 at the age of 86. The court found that the plaintiff had never suffered from any mental incapacity during her life time and therefore the judge was not required to account to the plaintiffs for their dealings with her mother's finances. The plaintiff was awarded $4,875.00 in costs plus $500.00 to be taxed. The defendants were jointly and severely liable for the costs which may be deducted from their respective entitlements in the estate.

HELD: Application adjourned and leave is given to each party to file further materials. The Farm Land Security Board is requested to provide its report to the Court. Ordinarily, the deficiency in the applicant's motion might merit dismissal, but the Act would then give the respondent a 1 year grace period. This result is unwarranted given that the scheme of the legislation is to encourage discussions between debtor and creditor and the respondent has refused to discuss mortgage issues. Further, the respondent's refusal to provide information should not be allowed to derail the process of financial review by the Farm Land Security Board. No costs to any party.","FIAT.

4_2006nssc88.txt,"The parties were married for thirteen years and had four children, who resided with the mother immediately following the divorce. The father paid one monthly sum ($6,000) comprised of both spousal and child support. Over a ten year period, all of the children had graduated from high school; two of the children had moved in with the father and he provided support directly to the other two children while they continued their education. After the first two children moved out of the mother's home, the parties orally agreed to reduce the child support payments. The parties were unable to negotiate a further reduction in the combined child and spousal support after the third child moved out of the mother's home. Since the parties' separation and divorce, the mother had not seriously pursued any educational retraining or furthered her education in her field of expertise; since the children had become independent, she occupied herself with volunteer work. The father now applied to terminate spousal support. The father shall continue to pay the sum of $3,000 per month as spousal support for one year; for the following year, the support will be reduced to $2,500 per month; in the following year, support shall be reduced to $2,000 per month, after which support will cease completely; the father shall continue his direct support of the children remaining dependant as they complete their current courses. Although the mother's effort in looking after four children and her absence from the workplace during the children's early years were significant factors, she had ignored her responsibility to move towards some sort of self sufficiency; given the number of children, the court extended the formula under the Spousal Support Guidelines beyond the maximum 13 year period; however, the mother must develop a reasonable strategy immediately to ensure that she either begins work in an area with better employment prospects or immediately attends courses to upgrade, refresh or enhance her ability to support herself.","The parties, who were married in November 1980 and began living separate and apart in August 1993, entered into an oral agreement in which the respondent was to pay $6,000 per month. There was no financial contribution by the mother to the children in the father's care. The father paid by post-dated cheques directly to the mother and the mother destroyed any cheques she received in the previous $2,500 amount; the father took responsibility for $69,500 in matrimonial debt and any other debt in his name. The agreement was recognized by Maintenance Enforcement and the parties' conduct was reviewed by the court. The mother alleged that she had no difficulty in future to pay the costs of his children's post-secondary pursuits and alleged that the father had no part in the agreement. Changes in the mother's income include $10,000 in monthly child and spousal support payments, $25,000 for the youngest child, who graduated from high school in June 2005, $43,600 in 2006 and $1,845 in 2007. She expects the father to continue to support her unabated and without termination, while paying all expenses related to her children's education. She has no serious contest with the father with her financial documentation. The two older children leaving their mother's care and either moving in with their father or being supported by their father has been discussed and his financial contribution proven. The history of the children leaves their mother, who is now deceased, and moves in with her father, has been considered and these records have not been challenged by the Respondent. There has been no variation of the order by court order since the Corollary Relief Judgment dated the 24th day of April, 1996."
7_2005skqb372.txt,"The applicant is a doctor enrolled in the orthopaedic surgery residency training program at the University of Saskatchewan (University). He was suspended from the program since approximately March 2000. There have been a number of legal proceedings between the applicant and the University since then. An appeal committee of the University held that the applicant be allowed to resume his residency training on probationary terms. This decision has not been implemented. At issue is a College of Medicine policy governing students who are funded by third party organizations or governments. The applicant is such a student. His third party funding was depleted during the time he was suspended. The College of Medicine insists he must find a third party sponsor prior to being allowed to resume his program. The Lieutenant Governor requested that a judge of the Court of Queen's Bench perform her role as visitor in this matter. HELD: 1) The court found the College of Medicine has not been objectively reasonable in the exercise of its discretion to insist that the appeal committee decision will not be implemented until such time as the applicant obtains third party funding. The court found it did not properly or fairly apply the third party funding policy on the facts. 2) The applicant is entitled to relief. The appeal committee decision will be implemented by the College of Medicine if the following conditions are met. The applicant must enter into a written agreement with the College of Medicine whereby he agrees that the money he was paid while on suspension is prepayment for all of the services he will perform for the College of Medicine in the remainder of his residency, that he will not claim any salary or monetary benefits available to other medical residents pursuant to the PAIRS agreement, and he will indemnify the College of Medicine if it is required to make payments to him pursuant to the PAIRS agreement during the remainder of his residency program. Further, PAIRS will enter into an agreement with the College of Medicine waiving the financial terms of the PAIRS agreement with respect to the applicant for the duration of his residency. 3) The applicant will be responsible for paying tuition fees, administration fees, insurance fees and any other college fees payable by other medical residents but he will be granted a credit for the fees deducted by the College of Medicine during the time he was suspended.","At issue was a College of Medicine policy governing students who are funded by third party organizations or governments. The policy states that in order for a student who is a resident to return to the program, he must first obtain external funding. The College insists that this funding was depleted during the period of his suspension. The student insists he must find a third party sponsor prior to being allowed to resume his program. HELD: 1) The student was paid for period in excess of two years while he was suspended from the program. He was placed on probation for a further six months. His third party funding was frozen during the time he was on probation. It is not clear whether the funding agency had any say in the College's decision to suspend the student. 2) There is no dispute that any exception to the policy would affect the integrity of the policy in the future. The fact that the student chose to have resort to the courts on two occasions suggests that the jurisdiction is more original than traditional supervisory or appellate jurisdiction. 3) The fact the student's third-party funding had been prepaid allowed for the suspension with pay which occurred. Funding on an annual basis would have obviated the problem which has arisen in this matter. 4) The applicant has not yet exhausted his appeals within the internal laws of the University, and specifically to the Council of Student Appeals and Academic Matters, which suggested the decision to place the student on probation had not yet been implemented. 5) There are a number of cases that raise the issue of whether visitatorial jurisdiction should include the right to review the exercise of those internal powers and discretions that derive from the internal law of the university. Jurisdiction to determine the appropriateness of a decision to impose a sentence on a resident who is not currently serving a probationary period does not lie with the Framers of Interpretation Act. The Framers were right in suggesting that a sentence could be imposed on a person who had not already served a term of probation. The Court of Queen's Bench agreed that such an exception would not have a practical effect. It would require the College to exercise its jurisdiction and powers as a visitor to the University in its ex officio role as visitor.  6) The College has been awarded status to appear at the hearing and did so. It will be prepared to enter into an agreement with the University of Saskatchewan."

Allowing the appeal, setting aside the chambers decision and giving judgment to the appellant. While the prothonotary did not have jurisdiction to extend the time for the application, an additional chambers order had resolved the timeliness issue in the appellant's favour.","The appellant mortgagee unsuccessfully sought a deficiency judgment against the respondent, a guarantor of the covenants of a mortgage given by Seawood Enterprises Ltd. to Prenor. The mortgage fell into arrears and the appellant commenced foreclosure proceedings against the respondents and one guarantor. It finally sold the property at a price of $295,000. The plaintiff then spent extensive effort to recover its outlay by marketing the property. The price obtained was significantly below the appraised value. The guarantor, who had plead non-compliance with Civil Procedure Rule 6.01 and 3.03, successfully challenged the plaintiff's claim. The application was dismissed with costs to the respondent. The Chambers judge held that the application could not succeed because the order of October 17, 1991 extending the time from the time within which an application for a deficiency judgement could be made was not one that the prothonotary had power to give.

The respondent husband proceeded with an uncontested divorce. The appellant wife did not oppose the proceeding. She subsequently appealed the corollary relief judgment on the grounds that the underlying separation agreement is unconscionable and unduly harsh. She sought to introduce fresh evidence bearing upon the circumstances leading up to the divorce. Dismissing the appeal with costs, that even with the new evidence, the appellant still failed to demonstrate an adequate excuse for not responding to the divorce proceeding. There was no evidence that the appellant did not understand her legal entitlement at the time the agreements were signed, or that she did not appreciate that a divorce proceeding had been commenced.","The parties were married for seven years and had two children, one of which was in the joint custody of the parties. Upon separation, the appellant moved into the basement of their matrimonial home with the respondent. She claimed that she was suffering from lingering depression and that she entered into an improvident separation agreement to alleviate the effects of the drug Effexor. The respondent opposed the agreement, arguing that it was unconscionable and unduly harsh. Allowing the application to admit fresh evidence, that the appellant had not proven that she had a reasonable excuse for failing to challenge the separation agreement at the time of its execution, and that there was no evidence from the appellant's psychiatrist confirming her state of mind at the relevant time and the probable effect of the medication upon her ability to make rational decisions, nor having established that the trial judge thought the proffered evidence could not reasonably have been expected to affect the result of the trial, was not an issue, and the matter was remitted to trial on the merits."
d_2013skca21.txt,"The appellant appealed the Queen's Bench decision that denied him damages for defamation (see: 2010 SKQB 249). The trial judge held that the defence of qualified privilege protected the Union and its representatives (the defendants in the action) when the latter republished a grievance defaming the appellant by falsely accusing him of having participated in the harassment of an employee. The trial judge fixed a provisional award of $25,000. The appellant's grounds of appeal were that the trial judge erred in finding that the defence applied and by assessing damages at $25,000. The respondents cross-appealed on the ground that the trial judge had erred in denying them costs. HELD: The Court held that the trial judge had erred in finding that the defence of qualified privilege applied. Although she correctly identified the law, she had not correctly applied it because she had not given sufficient effect to 1) the wording of the defamatory expressions; 2) the circumstances in which they were published and, in particular, the chronology of events and the separate instances of publication; 3) the persons to whom the words were published; and 4) whether what was published on each occasion was germane and reasonably appropriate to the specific occasion. In general, the Court noted that the respondents could have fulfilled their duty to notify its membership of the grievance filed by the member who alleged the harassment and made its effort to find witnesses to support the member's grievance by sending out a general notice. It did not need to name the appellant and make the allegations it did to achieve its goal. The respondent overreached, thereby placing the statement that the appellant had participated in the harassment of the employee outside the ambit of the defence of qualified privilege. The Court awarded general damages in the amount of $100,000. It held that the trial judge's assessment of damages was erroneous and founded upon mistaken principles of law. The Court was not bound by the range of damages mentioned by the Supreme Court in the Church of Scientology decision but only to apply the principles established in it to the context of this case. The provisional award of $25,000 for general damages was erroneous because the respondents published the documents by mailing them and placing them on the Union's website, over the strong objections of the employer. The respondents left the documents on the website for 6 months after the employer demanded that they be removed. The respondents had never offered an apology and appeared not to have recognized the harm that had been caused to the appellant. An award of aggravated damages was subsumed in the general award and the Court agreed with the trial judge that punitive damages were not warranted because the respondent had not been motivated by malice. The respondent's cross-appeal was dismissed without costs. However, their position was clearly correct in the circumstances: it was not appropriate for the trial judge to decline to order costs in their favour on the basis of 'mixed results', because in defamation cases, the results are invariably mixed.","HELD: The court allowed the appeal and fixed general damages at $100,000. The court found that the trial judge erred by finding the defamatory statements were protected by qualified privilege. The words expressed by the Union were defamed by the publication of the grievance. The trial judge correctly referred to the labour relations context and the purposes for which the communications were posted are more appropriately considered. The Union, Mr. Ross and Mr. Nowaselski are the respondents to the appellant's appeal and appellants by way of cross-appeal. The appellant is the former Director of the Veterinary Teaching Hospital, which encompasses approximately 600 faculty, staff and students and serves approximately 12,000 members of the public each year, as well as functioning as a teaching facility. The hospital is also a public health institution. The plaintiff filed a grievance against the union and its representatives claiming breach of its collective agreement. The grievance alleged systemic harassment, which was not supported by the plaintiff's allegations, but was entirely unsubstantiated and without substance. The union alleged that the plaintiff took an active part in the harassment himself and sought damages for loss of income, loss of pension, and loss of opportunity to obtain an equivalent position in the United States. The respondent commenced an action in defamation against the Union and the Hospital claiming general damages of over $200,000, based upon the conclusions reached by the arbitrators in Torstar Corp. and the Union in suing the union for breach of collective agreement and breach of contract. At issue was whether the arbitration board was the type of 'judicial' institution contemplated by the scope of absolute privilege and whether the publication that took place destroyed any possible claim that the Union might have to absolute privilege. Counsel for the union opposed the application of the defence of qualified privilege in this case, arguing that the court should have considered two factors in assessing whether the publications were protected: 1) that the words in the grievance referenced the Union’s grievance and the Grievance Report; and 2) whether the Union filed a statement of defence which indicated the statements were based on the same grievance and not an attempt to find corroborating witnesses. The parties’ argument that the union published a grievance to try and ensure the plaintiff was able to return to a harassment-free, non-toxic workplace environment but was forced to file this grievance when the plaintiff experienced renewed personal harassment after her return from overseas; and 3) that they published an informational poster that referenced the grievance but did not refer to the grievance itself; the Union did not"

He played with toys in the prisoner's box, paced around and pestered the deputy sheriff sitting with him for much of the proceeding.HELD: The accused was incapable of paying attention to the court proceeding or participating in a meaningful way because of his mental disability. The accused said that his lawyer was the judge, could not answer when asked what the judge's role was and he had limited insight into why he was in Court. The accused met the portion of the limited cognitive capacity test which requires an understanding of the nature of the proceedings and their possible consequences and the accused is capable of communicating his version of the events surrounding the allegations, but there is no possibility he could participate in a meaningful way in the trial. According to R. v. Jobb, the limited cognitive capacity test does not require that an accused be able to make rational decisions beneficial to himself, the Court's inquiry is limited to whether an accused can recount to their counsel the necessary facts of the offence to present a defence. The accused in this case was found fit to stand trial because he had a memory of what happened during the alleged offence despite having virtually no ability to participate in the proceeding.","The accused, who was charged with a variety of offences, was found unfit to stand trial pursuant to s. 672.23 of the Criminal Code. The Court found that the accused had 'limited cognitive capacity' which was not an accurate application of the limited cognitive capacity test, which requires that an accused be able to make rational decisions beneficial to him, or to analyse the facts of the trial. However, there was no evidence that he was unable to participate in his trial in a meaningful way. As a result of his mental situation, for the past significant period and for the foreseeable future he appears to be incapable of paying attention to his court proceeding or participating in it in any way."
b_2009nsca127.txt,"A couple signed a separation agreement which included a provision whereby they agreed to renounce and waive any claim in the estate of the other and any right to share in the estate of the other, which terms were incorporated into a corollary relief judgment. When he died, the former husband had not changed his will, which left the residue of his estate to his former wife. The Chambers judge held that the separation agreement had not revoked the will and the former wife was entitled to the testamentary gift. The mother of the deceased appealed. Appeal dismissed; although the Chambers judge's reasoning was flawed, the appellant had failed to produce any legal authority that a contractual promise to renounce, given for consideration before the death of a former spouse, binds a person to renounce a testamentary gift after his death. Even if the former spouse were so bound, there did not appear to be any privity of contract which would allow the appellant, who was not a party to the separation agreement, to enforce it.","The testator had left his wife, Ingrid, the residue of his estate. A few years later, he died in an automobile accident. The couple signed a separation agreement. They subsequently divorced. In the divorce, the executrix of their estate applied for an interpretation of the will and separation agreement, which held that the separation agreement did not revoke the will, nor did it affect the right of the former spouse to take the benefit of the deceased's estate. The executrix applied to have the judge find that, when he died, the former husband had not changed his will which left the residue to his former wife. The appellant argued that she had covenanted for valuable consideration to renounce any inheritance after the death of the testator. Dismissing the appeal, that the judge erred in law in finding that a contractual promise to renounced, given for consideration before a death of a former spouse, is not binding. The clause in question was confined to release of rights of inheritance only on intestacy. It did not address the right to confer benefit voluntarily. The judge did not decide the second issue before him which pertained to the distribution of the respondent's estate if none of the applicants were entitled to the gift of the residue."

The respondent was not the biological mother of the applicants. The applicants sought the removal of the personal representative, Joan, as personal representative because she was in a position of direct conflict. The continuing payment of the survivor benefits is an immediate benefit to her, which would be lessened if it were to be paid to the estate and divided amongst the heirs. The Respondent, as Adminstratrix of the Estate, would be required to bring an action against herself in her personal capacity."

Her appeal was allowed in part, the court holding the judge erred in ruling inadmissible certain evidence about the value of scallop licences. The matter was remitted to Supreme Court for determination on evidence to be adduced by the parties of the value of the respondent's fishing operation. In preparation, the appellant applied to the Supreme Court for an order to inspect the respondent's bank records pursuant to s. 21(1) of the Evidence Act. The respondent argued he had limited involvement in the enterprise being discovered. The judge granted the order with limitations: the examination was to be limited to income received by the respondent and covering the period from the trial date forward. The appellant appealed, arguing the limitations disallowed full disclosure. In the interim, the respondent went into bankruptcy and argued the examination would be fully conducted by the trustee. Allowing the appeal, that a possible duplication was no reason to limit full disclosure.","This was an appeal from a decision of the Supreme Court in Chambers granting an application under s. 21(4) of the Nova Scotia Evidence Act ordering inspection of banking records to the appellant, but imposing two limitations. The appellant appealed the 1993 decision of Mr. Justice Boudreau dividing property between them as separated spouses pursuant to the Matrimonial Property Act. This Court allowed the wife's appeal in part holding that the judge erred in ruling inadmissible certain evidence about the value of scallop licenses. The Chambers judge however gave no valid reasons for the two restrictions respecting the books or records respecting the fishing licenses and vessels but ordered them to be deleted. The respondent has since gone into bankruptcy. He contends that the examination ordered by the Chambers judge is nothing but a duplication of the detailed and searching examinations that will be made of his assets by the trustee in the bankruptcy proceedings. The appeal is allowed and the 2 restrictions placed in the order of the Chamber judge respecting the Books or records relating to Fundy Associates Limited and the motor vessel are deleted."
c_2006skqb87.txt,"The appellant appeals its conviction of selling tobacco to a minor contrary to s. 8(1) of the Tobacco Act. The appellant argues that the learned trial judge erred in law by applying an unreasonably high standard of due diligence to the facts of the case. HELD: The appeal is allowed, the conviction is quashed and a verdict of acquittal is entered.  1) The court reviewed in detail the steps the appellant had in place. 2) The court was of the view that the trial judge erred in applying an unreasonably high standard for this defence. The trial judge applied a standard of due diligence that required the appellant to be able to prove that there were no other possible precautions or action that could have been taken to prevent the company's cashiers from selling cigarettes. This standard exceeds the requirements of a reasonable person. By applying a higher standard of due diligence, the trial judge erred in law. Had the appropriate standard of due diligence been applied to the facts of this case, the appellant would have succeeded.","The defendant was convicted on a summary conviction charge. The defendant appealed on the basis that the trial judge erred in law by applying an unreasonably high standard of due diligence to the facts of the case and by failing to apply the doctrine of stare decisis. HELD: The appeal was allowed. The conviction was quashed, the sentence was vacated and an acquittal entered. There was no evidence that the defendant had followed due diligence procedures in establishing a proper system to prevent their cashiers from selling tobacco to minors and whether they had taken reasonable steps to ensure the effective operation of the system. The evidence showed that prior to the incident, Westfair had an established system created to prevent the commission of the offence. The trial judge applied a standard of diligence which required the defendant to be able to prove that there were no other possible precautions or actions could have been taken by the company's cashiers before they could purchase tobacco. This standard exceeds the requirements of a reasonable person. The defence will be available if the accused reasonably believed in a mistaken set of facts which, if true, would render the act or omission innocent, or if he took all reasonable measures to avoid the particular event. The system used by the defendant in R. v. Westfair Foods Ltd. and Roy H. Friesen, s.Ct. 1997, 138 C.C.R. (3d) 68 (Ont. Prov. Ct.) set out the powers of the summary conviction appeal judge. The appeal procedure for summary conviction appeals can be found in Part XXVII of the Criminal Code (ss.813). Section 813 applies to a person accused of a strict liability offence. A person is not required to possess extraordinary or great diligence. They are not required or required to exercise the extreme care that a person of unusual prudence would apply. The standard of correctness is not unreasonable. It is consistent with standard of perfection and essentially implies zero tolerance. There are situations where employees are required to participate in role playing activities in order to get familiar with the store's policies and procedures. The availability of the defence to corporation will depend on whether such due diligence was taken by those who are the directing mind and will of a corporation, whose acts are therefore in law the acts of the corporation itself."
e_2009skca138.txt,"This appeal concerns the assessment for municipal purposes of a building located in the City of Regina and used commercially as an enclosed shopping mall. The building was assessed in each of the years 2003 and 2004 on the basis of its 'fair value' as determined by the City Assessor. The owner of the building, the corporate appellant, was dissatisfied with the Assessor's determination of fair value and appealed the assessment to the local Board of Revision, then to the Assessment Appeals Committee of the Saskatchewan Municipal board. The appeals were allowed in part, but the corporate appellant remained dissatisfied. It applied for leave to appeal to this Court pursuant to s. 33.1 of The Municipal Board Act. The issues on appeal all relate to the determination of the fair value of the building and, more particularly, to the market adjustment factor used in that determination. The grounds take issue one way or another with the inclusion of the sales of the Southland and Victoria Square Malls in the array of sales from which the MAF was derived, or alternatively, with the adjustment of the sale price of these properties. HELD: Appeal dismissed. The appeal in relation to the treatment of the sale of the Victoria Square Mall fails, as does the appeal concerning the sale of the Southland Mall. The Court notes that other companies, owning or operating similar malls, also took issue with their 2003 and 2004 assessments. They, too, appealed to the Board of Revision and then to the Assessment Appeals Committee. They too were granted leave to appeal to this Court on the same grounds as the appellant in this case. Counsel for the companies agreed to treat this appeal as representative of the other appeals and to be bound by the result of this appeal. These other appeals are also dismissed.","The appellant company appealed the assessment of a building located in the City of Regina and used commercially as an enclosed shopping mall. The mall was owned by the appellant company. The appellant company was dissatisfied with the City Assessor's determination of its fair value and appealed it to the Assessment Appeals Committee. The Committee found that the Assessor could not use the sale of the Northgate Mall as a 'portfolio sale' because the sale price did not amount to an 'arm's length sale'. It alleged that the Committee erred in law in failing to find that the sales of the three shopping malls in the analysis did not constitute a 'fair value' as determined by the City, as they were all sold at a rate close to market value and did not include any non-realty items. The company applied for leave to appeal under section 33.1 of The Municipal Board Act alleging an error of law. HELD: The appeal was dismissed with costs. 1)The Committee did not misapprehend the importance, generally, of the sale verification process and the information it yielded. The importance lies in the fact municipal assessors are highly dependent on the information at his command, including the information supplied to him by the parties to the transaction. Accordingly, the Committee concluded that the sale qualified for inclusion in the array of sales from which the MAF was derived or, alternatively, it claimed that it was a 'willing, unrestricted, unrelated and knowledgeable' buyer within the meaning of the definition of 'arm's length sale' (i.e. a 'diminished' buyer) and were required to take the mall as part of the package and retain the services of the former owner as managers. 2)It was in reliance on the provisions of s. 171 and s. 172 of The Cities Act that the assessor requested the completion of the Sale Verification Form. He did so in reliance upon the three-fold purpose of putting him in position to determine the fair value of the property. He then to calculate and apply a market adjustment factor (MAAF) of 1.31. 3)The reduction in the price had significant impact on the assessments but the company remained dissatisfied and appealed to the Court of Appeal which dismissed the appeal and upheld the Committee's decision to include the sale in the determination of an appropriate MAF (maintaining a fair value for the property). The Court found that both the assessment and the Committee failed to observe the need for an adjustment pursuant to Document 1.1.6 of the Assessment Manual. The"
c_2003skqb519.txt,"The Court was presented with a consent judgment. The respondent was unrepresented. The Court found the terms of the consent judgment were so unfair as to be unconscionable. HELD: The Court refused to issue the order on the grounds that the Court must not be seen as legitimatizing, condoning, acquiescing or approving of an unconscionable bargain.","The Court presented with a form of a consent judgment bearing the consents of the two parties. At first blush, one might assume the parties would jointly be seeking relief, but the terms of the proposed judgment were unconscionable. There had not been equality in the bargaining positions of the parties and the petitioner had chosen not to seek legal counsel and advice. HELD: The application was dismissed with costs of the application and the court's own costs of filing the report. 1)The terms were improvident. There was not equality in bargaining positions. The petitioner was prepared to forfeit her right to spousal support though she earned only $15,000 a year while the respondent earned $48,000. The proposed judgment provided that the petitioner was not obliged to pay child support in the foregoing circumstances. 2)No reasonable person would conclude that the proposal judgment was anything but unconscionsable and would speculate that at some point in the future, the petitioner will come to realize how patently unfair the proposed judgement was to her. 3)The parties did not need Court order nor judgment to attain their apparent goals. The parties were content to proceed with this arrangement without the formality of a judgment or contract. They were not seeking legal advice or advice but were seeking advice and guidance from counsel who could be of assistance if the petitioner needed it. The court could not urge the petitioner to seek advice or guidance but would urge her counsel and would urge the court to seek the advice of counsel who would be most helpful to her in the circumstances. 4)There was no equality for guidance and guidance on how to use legal advice and counsel in the best circumstances. The agreement was clearly improvident in that it sought to have the parents respect the children's wishes regarding their choice of residence and the time that they might wish to spend with each parent. It was also possible to reduce their understanding to writing, even if there was no lawyer prepared to sign a certificate of independent advice for obvious reasons. 5)The proposed judgment was not in harmony with the petitioner's position on matters of the law and could not be taken to task for the petitioner or the Court to approve it.  6)The petitioner would be awarded costs of preparing the legal advice requested by the petitioner."

Those who have been demoted do suffer."
5_2016skqb384.txt,"Criminal Law – Motor Vehicle Offences – Driving with Blood Alcohol Exceeding .08 – Conviction – AppealConstitutional Law – Charter of Rights, Section 10(b) – Appeal The accused appealed her conviction under s. 253(1)(b) of the Criminal Code of driving with a blood alcohol content over .08 on the grounds that the trial judge erred in law finding that there was no breach of her s. 8 Charter rights or of a breach of her s. 10(b) Charter rights. The first ground pertained to the defence’s contention that the officer who stopped the accused and made the breath demand did not have sufficient evidence of impaired driving. The officer testified that he was patrolling for impaired drivers on the night in question and observed the accused make a very tight right-hand turn, entering the untraveled portion of the road where the snow was soft. He noticed that her eyes were glassy and she was slurring her speech. She had just lit a cigarette, which suspects often do to mask the smell of alcohol. When she did put the cigarette out, he smelled alcohol on her breath. He asked her to step out of the vehicle and noticed that she swayed while standing still. She walked with a wide stance to the police cruiser and had to lean against it to maintain her balance. When he first asked the appellant if she had had anything to drink, she said that she’d had three but later said that she’d had five. He arrested her and made the breath demand. The defence argued that the trial judge erred in failing to consider other evidence that other vehicles had made similar turns and that the appellant did not require any assistance in leaving her vehicle and walking to the police cruiser, among other things. With respect to the second ground, the appellant advised the officer that she wanted to speak to a specific lawyer after being arrested. At the detachment, the appellant located the lawyer’s number and the officer dialed it. A voice message was left on the lawyer’s telephone but no return call was received. The officer advised the appellant she could call another lawyer, and initially she responded that she did not want to but wished to provide a breath sample. The officer was about to read her a waiver of her right when the appellant indicated that she wanted to call another lawyer. The officer called the number but received an after-hours message. He asked the appellant if she wanted to try another lawyer and she declined, stating that she was satisfied with leaving a message. She then provided her first breath sample. The defence argued at trial that the officer failed to advise the appellant of the availability of Legal Aid and failed to provide the Prosper warning, thereby breaching s. 10(b) of the Charter.  HELD: The appeal was dismissed. The court found that the trial judge had not erred: 1) by finding there was no s. 8 breach. The judge had not made any findings of fact that were not supported by the evidence nor did he fail to consider relevant evidence when he found that the officer had sufficient evidence that objectively supported his belief that the appellant’s ability to drive was impaired; and 2) by finding that there had been no breach of s. 10(b). The appellant had failed to act diligently in pursuing her right to speak with a lawyer and provided a clear and unequivocal indication that she had abandoned her right to counsel when she said she was happy leaving a message.","The appellant appeals her conviction under s. 253(1)(b) of the Criminal Code for driving with a blood alcohol content of over.08. The appellant contends that the trial judge erred in law in finding there was no breach of s. 8 Canadian Charter of Rights. HELD: The appeal is dismissed. 1) The trial judge properly found that there was sufficient evidence, when viewed objectively, to support the officer's contention that the appellant was impaired. The standard of review on a summary conviction appeals is based on an error of law, failure to consider all relevant evidence in making a determination that there is sufficient objective evidence for the officer to make a breath demand. 2) The appellant challenges the objective basis for that belief, namely that there wasn't sufficient evidence that the accused has, within the preceding three hours, driven while impaired or while over the proscribed limit. 3) On the whole of the evidence, am satisfied that the court properly found there was a sufficient evidence of a breach of her s. 10(b) Charter rights. When making a demand for a breath sample, an officer is only required to believe that the suspect has committed an offence and the police have an obligation to refrain from eliciting any incriminating evidence until the detainee has been given the opportunity to consult with legal counsel. 4) The standard for assessing credibility can only be set out by an appeal court with great deference and, absent palpable and overriding error, the facts as found by the judge should not be disturbed."

Alternatively, she sought a Voices of the Child report. The applicant indicated that the child expressed a desire to live with her full-time. The parties’ affidavits conflicted as to their behaviour. The applicant indicated that the child told her he was required to continue skiing with the respondent even though he was having a seizure. She also indicated that the child told her that the respondent told his roommate he was going to stab the applicant and he called her crazy. HELD: The court found it appropriate to order a Voices of the Child report. It was determined that the variation application decision was dependent on the report. There were more issues at play than a bald statement by the applicant that the child requested to live with her full-time. The child was an appropriate age for the report, being over 12 years old. He was able to communicate effectively and the report would be meaningful to the court. The order was to be paid for through resources provided to the program. The parties were prohibited from discussing the report process with the child and they were ordered not to influence, coach, sway, or prompt the child towards particular views or statements for the purposes of the report.

b_2002skqb131.txt,"The Crown appealed the dismissal of charges of impaired driving and driving with a blood alcohol level exceeding .08. The trial judge held the circumstances supported a special plea of autrefois acquit and that the manner of proceeding by the Crown was an abuse of process at common law. Alberta did not withdraw or abandon the charges and suspended his driving privileges for 3 months. Upon request, SGI also suspended his Saskatchewan driving privileges. At issue was whether the Alberta court lost jurisdiction; if so, whether that gave rise to a plea of autrefois acquit in Saskatchewan; apart from any loss of jurisdiction did the police procedure amount to an abuse of process at common law. HELD: The Informations were stayed. The trial judge erred in finding a plea of autrefois acquit was applicable but was correct in concluding Alberta lost jurisdiction. 1)The Information remained dismissed for want of prosecution. Jurisdiction over the respondent was lost when the information was not available in the Alberta Provincial Court, the appearance notice was not confirmed and the matter could not be dealt with (R. v. McGinnis). The Alberta court could have regained jurisdiction by issuing a summons or warrant within 3 months of February 6, 2001. A summons was not issued until August. The information was by then deemed to have been dismissed for want of prosecution pursuant to s.485(3). 'Deemed' in s.485(3) does not mean 'presumed until otherwise proven'. It means that the information is dismissed without any action by the court. Once dismissed the proceeding could only be recommenced with consent of the Attorney General or leave of the court, neither of which were obtained. 2)With respect to jurisdiction in Saskatchewan, s.476(b) grants concurrent jurisdiction to any province in which the offence may have been committed or committed within 500 metres of any province in order to prevent a charge from failing because of uncertainty as to location. The section was not intended to permit simultaneous prosecutions in two provinces or in a second province in the event of a failure in the first. 3)The respondent's appearance in a Saskatchewan courtroom as a result of a summons did not revive jurisdiction in Alberta. The Alberta proceeding was deemed to have been dismissed for want of prosecution on May 6, 2001. The charges have not been disposed of within the meaning of s.730(3). There was no finding in respect of which an appeal can be taken. The special plea of autrefois acquit is not available in these circumstances. 4)The prosecutorial conduct of the police in proceeding simultaneously in two provinces amounted to an abuse of process. The respondent was obliged to defend identical charges arising out of the same incident in two provinces for almost a year at substantial cost and stress. The police acted with arbitrary purpose and without regard for the principles of fundamental justice. The lack of malice or improper motive does not preclude a finding of abuse of process.","The Crown appealed a summary conviction appeal brought by the trial judge dismissing charges of impaired driving and driving with a blood alcohol level exceeding.08 percent. The trial judge held that the circumstances supported a special plea of autrefois acquit and that the manner of proceeding by the Crown was an abuse of process at common law. HELD: The appeal was dismissed.  1)The trial judge erred in law in finding that the court had lost jurisdiction as he specifically found that if there was loss of jurisdiction it was over the offence. 2)The Saskatchewan information was sworn in March 2001 but was not available in the Alberta Court when the respondent appeared. 3)The Provincial Court judge accepted the special plea and dismissed the charges. The charges in Alberta were already deemed to have been dismissed for want of prosecution. The special plea by the respondent was based solely on the deemed dismissal for wantof prosecution in Alberta. 4)The Court was unable to agree that an appearance by a respondent in a Saskatchewan court as a result of a summons issued before May 7, 2001 revived jurisdiction over the respondent. The Alberta proceeding was deemed to be dismissed for wants of prosecution on May 6, 2001. 5)The Special Pleadings of Autrefois Acquit and Motor Vehicle Accidentals were stayed. 6)An application for a stay of proceedings was made by the Court of Appeal in Edmonton. 7)Each province has its own set of rules and regulations respecting the use of force in their respective jurisdictions. 8)A review of s.487(3) of the Code does not give rise to a successful plea of autorefois acquitted. 9)When jurisdiction was lost in Alberta the charges in Saskatchewan did not have before it an information. The Saskatchewan court did not lose jurisdiction when nothing happened in March 2000 and the subsequent appearance in May 2001. The deemed dismissal did not preclude recommencing the proceedings in Saskatchewan. 10)The accused was awarded his costs in the addition of costs of the proceeding in addition to his legal expenses. 11)The court was awarded the costs of defending the respondent in Alberta and ordered to defend three months of administrative expenses. 12)An appeal of the decision of the Provincial Court Judge was granted."

The applicant could have proceeded to dissolution under Division XVI. In s. 210(m) the legislature intended to give the court the ability to order disposition of property of creditors and shareholders but not to deal with a shareholder’s right to distribution on dissolution.","Shareholders approved a plan of arrangement and sought an order approving it pursuant to s. 186.1 of the Business Corporations Act and s. 220(3) of the Saskatchewan Corporations Branch. The plan proposed to distribute shares among its 275 shareholders according to their respective rights. The proposal was opposed on the basis that s. 204 of the Act requires a corporation to distribute its assets according to its respective rights and that if a creditor or shareholder cannot be found, their pro rata entitlement to return of the corporation's capital will accrue to and be paid to the remaining known shareholders. The applicant argued the court has the power to approve such an arrangement under the powers given to it under ss.186.1(4), 203(8) and 210(m) and the power given to the court under s. 210(1(1)(e) to permit the court to approve a proposed distribution to shareholders of their entitlement, qua shareholders, either in the form of money or the division of property or assets. HELD: The court adopted an interpretation that was appropriate for the purpose of the proposed distribution.  1) The proposal complied with all statutory requirements for an arrangement to be approved by the court and satisfies the criteria enunciated in the Act. The court could not find any conflict between the mandatory requirements in ss. 220 and 221 and the authority to override the mandatory directions in s.220 and 221. The Court could exercise its power under the s.210(l) while comply with the mandatory direction in s210(m). 2) There was no conflict with the right to share in the distribution of the capital that would have otherwise been payable to the shareholders. 3) The proposed distribution was not fit for a purpose which the legislature did not intend. 4) The court was able to find no evidence that the proposal had a wider purpose and intent than that of assisting the applicant in its submissions. 5) The Court had no difficulty in finding the Supreme Courts analysis in BCE to be equally applicable to the FCC application."

The plaintiff had not proven his claim on a balance of probabilities that the defendant was responsible for the damage to his lawn.,"The plaintiff alleges that the defendant applied a substance in the back alley next to his property which caused damage to his lawn in the Town of Wadena. Report by Back-Track Investigations and Special Services Ltd. supports the plaintiff's belief that damage occurred to their back yard lawn was caused by run-off and/or leaching of a substance from the alley. However, the evidence does not support that. In preceding years, before it was moved to the Statchuk yard, it was used to store tools, machinery and applicators. The floor in it replaced before moving to his yard. HELD: The plaintiff's claim is dismissed. The onus is not on the defendant to establish an alternative source of the offending substance and this involves proving that the plaintiff was responsible for killing their lawn. For the reasons stated, he has not done so. There are valid reasons for the town employee's suspicions. He was a Professional Agrologist with a Bachelor of Science Degree in Crop Science and was qualified as an expert in the area of plant chemicals including how they are to be used and their effects on lawns and gardens.

Appeal dismissed,"The appeal was put to the Court below prematurely, with the result that it was put on what was essentially a hypothetical basis, and Charter decisions should not be made without sufficient factual base. There was no evidence put before the Court that the appellants or any of them had yet suffered any adverse consequences as result of the impugned legislation, although proceedings were pending before the Labour Relations Board which might result in adverse consequences. More particularly, there was no suggestion that anyone had lost their job or had been in any way penalized for refusing to either pay union dues or to join the union, nor was there any evidence as to why anyone objected to being a member of the bargaining unit in question or the union in question so as to permit any reasoned decision as to the alleged right not to associate. The respondents had their costs of the appeal under double col. V, except the Attorney General who did not ask for costs. Appeal dismissed."
c_1995canlii5987.txt,The accused was charged with sexual assault and was tried in the Court of Queen's Bench. The evidence at trial indicated that the alleged acts had occurred prior to the accused becoming an adult. He had not been ordered transferred into adult court under s.16 of The Young Offenders Act. HELD: Accused acquitted. 1)The Judge was satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt that the accused had sexually assaulted the complainant. 2)Because the complainant's evidence suggested that the assault occurred while the accused was a young offender the Judge concluded that the Court of Queen's Bench was without jurisdiction in the matter.,"The sole issue before me was whether it had been proven beyond reasonable doubt that the sexual assaults alleged occurred on or after October 22, 1986, the date that the accused became an adult. The case had not come to the Youth Court as a transfer had been made from Youth Court to Youth Court. A concurrent proceeding was pending in Youth Court which the accused was to transfer from. The Facts Neither the complainant nor the accused were particularly credible as witnesses, each having been convicted of numerous criminal offences involving deceit, dishonesty and disrespect for the law. Each had spent considerable time in jail. The complainant did not attempt to embellish or exaggerate her testimony even though she had the opportunity to do so. She was now 19 years old and had a child shortly after she turned 14 years of age from a more recent abusive relationship. She is now trying to come to terms with what was done to her during her childhood. HELD: 1)The Court had exclusive jurisdiction over offences committed by persons while under the age of 18 years. The Court of Queen's Bench accordingly had jurisdiction only when such a matter is transferred to it pursuant to s.6 of the Act. 2)The case before the Court was not transferred from the youth court as a result of a concurrent proceeding."
5_2001canlii345.txt,"The accused was charged with operating an overweight vehicle on a weight restricted road contrary to s.38(1)(b) of the Highways and Transportation Act. No permit had been issued for the tractor trailer. The defence argued the document entitled 'order for road restriction on provincial highway #332 pursuant to s.35 of the Highway Traffic Act' was not proof of the Minister's order according to law; even if the document is proof, the order is a 'regulation' under the Interpretation Act and so the provisions of the Regulations Act applies; since those requirements have not been met, the Crown has not established an order had been made for the purposes of this case. HELD: It was not proven beyond a reasonable doubt that the accused violated s.38(1)(b). It was not established that the order was published for the purpose of this prosecution nor that the document filed in court is proof of the order itself.  1)It is well known that in a criminal case a provision that enables the Crown to expeditiously prove certain elements of an offence must be strictly satisfied. Since a violation of the HTA is prosecuted under s.4 of the Summary Offences Procedure Act, which in turn adopts the Criminal Code summary conviction procedure, the Crown must strictly comply with the provisions respecting proof.  2)It is mandatory for the Minister to give notice of the order and there was no evidence he exercised his discretion by determining the most advisable manner in which notice was to be given. The Minister failed to take appropriate steps to cause notice of the order to be given. The Department of Highways placed road signs warning and advising of weight restrictions on the highway and along grid roads accessing #332, but no notice was given to the general public. Notifying persons who reside or do business in the immediate area of the road is not sufficient to satisfy the requirement to publish. 3)Even if it could be said sufficient notice was given, it could not be concluded that the endorsement upon the order that the order 'conforms to the original' meets the statutory requirement that the copy must be a certified copy 'under the hand of an officer or person in whose custody the...public document is placed' (s.12 SEA) since it was not known if she had custody of the document or under the hand of any of the persons set out in s.7(c) of the SEA since her official capacity is not described. The order was not published in the Saskatchewan Gazette and so a copy of the order so published could not be produced (s.7(a) SEA). It was not proven that the copy of the order had been printed by the Queen's Printer (s.7(b) SEA).","The accused was charged with operating a motor vehicle that violated the Minister's weight order contrary to s38(1)(b) of The Highways and Transportation Act, 1997. The accused owned a tractor trailer and another person owned a trailer. The trailer was overweight by 16,300 kilograms. The police observed the accused operating it in an easterly direction approaching a junction of highways #32 and 332. The officer stopped the vehicle and found it was being operated by the accused. No other notice was given to the public or to entities that were involved in the transport of goods. The Department of Highways had erected signs warning and advising of weight restrictions on highway #332. There was no publication in any local newspaper or provincial daily or in any other media. The municipality appeared to have taken it upon itself to advise persons in the municipal division about the weight restriction and to advise others in the immediate area that were in the business of hauling. Traffic signs were in place along the highway leading to and from various grid roads throughout the province. HELD: Notice of an order made by the Minister of the provincial Crown affecting a public highway should have been given so as to advise as many members of the public as possible. The Minister failed to take appropriate steps to cause notice of the order to be given. Even if it could be said that the steps taken by the municipality satisfy the notice provisions for the purposes of this prosecution, the Crown cannot establish that an order has been made for the purpose of this case.  1)It is mandatory for the minister to give notice of a minister's order issued pursuant to section 35 of the Provincial Highway Traffic Act. There is no evidence before the court to indicate that the minister exercised his discretion by determining the most 'advisable' manner in which notice was granted. It is not for the Minister to advise the accused that the matter is with the municipality. 2)Signs were located along the main grid roads leading into and around the municipalities. There were numerous other signs which clearly indicated that the Minister intended to restrict the weight on the highway such that heavier vehicles would be re-directed onto municipal grid roads.  3)No other notice to the general public was given."
3_1997canlii11384.txt,"The Minister of Social Services applied for an order that the Public Trustee be served with notice of a protection hearing and act as litigation guardian for H.B. who was alleged to be of unsound mind. H.B.'s child born in 1995 was apprehended at birth and was currently subject of a child protection hearing. The Minister relied on the Public Trustee Act and, alternatively, on the court's inherent parens patriae jurisdiction.HELD: The Public Trustee was appointed amicus curae to act on behalf of H.B. upon being satisfied she is unable to act for herself. An assessment was ordered pursuant to s32 of the Child and Family Services Act. The order was to issue unless the Public Trustee shows cause as to why it is not the appropriate party within 10 days from the date of this order. 1)While the wording of s32 is ambiguous the Public Trustee was correct that the Act does not authorize it to represent an adult under a mental disability other than where a property interest is involved. Nowhere does the Act authorize the Public Trustee to act as personal guardian of a dependant or mentally incompetent adult. The PT Act does not authorize its appointment as litigation guardian in the matter of child protection proceedings. 2)Pursuant to its parens patriae jurisdiction the Court has a responsibility to protect the interests of H.B. who requires independent representation to ensure her rights are protected. If the court failed to intervene H.B. will be left in limbo, a victim of the system.","The Minister of Social Services applied for an order that the Public Trustee be served with notice of a protection hearing and act as litigation guardian for the child. The child was apprehended at birth and is currently the subject of a child protection hearing. The applicant takes the position that it is not the appropriate party to act as a litigation guardian on behalf of H.B. However that does not fully determine the issue. Pursuant to its statutory authority and to its inherent parens patriae jurisdiction, the Court has a responsibility to protect the interests of the child; she requires independent representation to ensure that her rights are protected. HELD: An order was issued pursuant to s. 32 of The Child and Family Services Act and an order was ordered to issue accordingly unless the public trustee, within 10 days from the date of this order, showed cause as to why it was not the proper party to so act. There was no order as to costs.  1)The Minister was right in asserting that the Act does not authorize it to represent an adult under mentaldisability in cases other than where a property interest is involved. 2)S. 32 is considered in the context of the entire Act. It is intended to authorize the public trustee to protect and administer the property of infants and dependant adults. Nowhere does the Act authorize the PTA toact as a personal guardian of a dependant or mentally incompetent adult. 3)The Public Trustees best fits the criteria enunciated by Wright J. in Szwydky v. Magiera."
1996canlii6754.txt,"A radio station reported that a 12 year old girl was dragged and sexually assaulted behind a roller rink or between the rink and a store. The owner of the rink claimed financial compensation for a subsequent decline in his business which he alleged was a direct result of the broadcast. The script and reel had been destroyed and it was impossible to recreate exactly what was aired. HELD: The action was dismissed with costs. 1)Nothing that the defendant published was false, malicious, dishonest, negligent or recklessly published without careful justification, improper motive or excuse. 2)The station followed the CRTC Regulations and was exonerated entirely by its controlling body. The defendant published the news it received from the police, a proven reliable source. 3)Nothing pointed to the defendant as being the cause for the loss of profits by the plaintiff's roller rink operation. The business was on a down side at the time. The assault occurring where it did was not the fault of either party. If it had a bearing on the immediate attendance figure it was minimal and the plaintiff did no promotion whatsoever to increase attendance.","The 12 year old girl and two juvenile offenders who had been roller skating at the Wheel-A-While Family Roller Rink in Prince Albert had been charged with sexual assault. The plaintiff's radio station was investigated and found to be a proven reliable source of information. Records were kept for eight weeks as a result of the CRTC investigation. Nothing was published that was false,malicious, dishonest, negligent or recklessly published without careful justification, improper motive or excuse. The attendance at the plaintiff's station was down for several days after the newscast came on the air. The employees at the defendant's store suspected that the owner of the business had been sexually assaulted at the premises. HELD: The plaintiff had a cause of action against the defendant and the action was dismissed with costs.  1)The plaintiff published the news that it received from the police, always a reliable source. Nothing points to the defendant as being the cause for the loss of profits by the plaintiff in its roller rink operation. The business was on down side at the time. The sexual assault occurring where it did not occur was not the fault of either the plaintiff or the defendant. The defendant was merely doing its job of reporting news; there was no way they knew or ought to have known that the news which were aired would cause harm to their business or to their health.  2)The CRTC did what it was ordered to do and was exonerated by its controlling body, the CCR, for doing so. The court found that the defendant published the information that it receives from the Police and from the general public. 3)The plaintiffs suffered a loss of $12,500.00 in the first three months of 1991. The loss was attributed to the defendants' failure to pursue the sexual assault complaint and to the fact that the defendants had refused to pursue their contractual obligations with respect to the plaintiff. 4)The court awarded the plaintiff $7,500 in the amount of the settlement amount and the rest was left to the plaintiffs, who appealed the decision of the Court to strike.  5)The Court awarded the rest of the costs of the action with costs of $1,000.00."
e_1996canlii5466.txt,"This was an appeal from a trial court decision questioning whether the trial judge erred in determining that the appellant's rights under s.7 and s.8 of the Charter had not been violated. When man involved in an accident checked himself into hospital, the attending physician informed the RCMP of the accident and an RCMP officer came to the hospital. As the appellant had indicated to the physician that he had been drinking, the RCMP constable read demand for blood sample, which the attending physician attempted to obtain. The appellant refused and asked to speak to his lawyer. Unable to contact lawyer, the appellant refused to supply blood sample and was charged with refusal under s. 254(2) of the Criminal Code. The trial judge had held that as the physician attempted to obtain sample for medical purposes, he was not acting in the capacity of agent of the state, and his actions were not subject to the Charter. Dismissing the appeal, that while there may have been some issues of breach of confidentiality, the physician's actions were not analogous to search and seizure within s.8 of the Charter. The trial judge did not err in determining that the appellant's rights were not violated under either s.7 or s.8 of the Charter.","This was an appeal against a decision wherein the appellant was convicted of an offence contrary to s.254(5) of the Criminal Code. The appellant had been drinking and was in a motor vehicle accident one half to one hour prior to the attending doctor giving the sample. At trial, the trial judge held that the officer who had accompanied the accused to the hospital for treatment for injuries received in a single vehicle accident was obliged to report accidents that had not been reported. The doctor prepared a medical report on October 30, 1987. That report included the results of the blood alcohol tests from the first blood sample and diagnosis the accused was intoxicated at the time of being treated in the emergency department. The officer then read a demand for a blood sample to the accused without his consent. The accused did not reply and the officer then proceeded to charge him with refusal. The trial judge did not err when she found the appellant's rights under s.8 of the Charter were not violated."
8_2016skqb154.txt,"HELD: The order was granted. Following the expiry of the current temporary order, the court found that the children were in need of protection pursuant to s. 11 of The Child and Family Services Act. As the father had taken no steps to deal with his anger, violence and alcohol issues, the children continued to be in need of protection as they were likely to suffer physical harm at his hands. Their psychological well-being required that they remain in protection to allow them to deal with the trauma they had suffered while they were in his care. Therefore, the court found that because the children were doing well in foster care and did not wish to be returned to their father and that the expert had advised against them having any further contact with him, it would make a permanent order rather than a long-term order.","The Ministry sought a permanent wardship order with respect to two children. The parents of the children, despite being more or less involved with the proceedings for some of the period since the action was commenced, did not appear for the trial of the action. HELD: The Court was satisfied sufficient change can occur within the context of an order under s. 37(1) such that it is in the best interests of the child to make such an order. The Ministry failed to show that they had taken measurable steps to deal with their anger, violence and alcohol issues. The children continued to be in need of protection as they were likely to suffer physical harm at the hands of their father. The Court found that both parents were genuinely committed to the children's welfare and that their involvement with the children was necessary to ensure their continued safe care. There was no adult person able or willing to provide for their needs and the children were exposed to emotional and physical harm as a result of the trauma they had been exposed to."
b_2013skqb395.txt,HELD: The Court found the accused guilty of 10 counts and 7 counts were dismissed.,"The accused was charged with 14 counts of indecent assault and three counts of gross indecency against 14 individuals, all of whom were boys who attended the residential school between January 1, 1959 and December 31, 1967. The residential school was located at Beauval in the Province of Saskatchewan. The accused was considered the golden-haired boy of the priests and nuns and was very popular with the boys at the school. He developed the intermural hockey, competitive fastball and softball teams and the Beauval Warriors, which was the regional champion hockey team through most of the years. There were times when the relationship with various boys crossed the line from appropriate and acceptable behaviour to become acts of sexual assault and sexual interference. The Court was required to take into account the potential distraction of the trier of fact from its proper focus on the facts charged and the potential for undue time consumption."
c_2012skqb372.txt,"The plaintiff purchased insurance from the defendant. In 2000, the plaintiff's farm was damaged by a fire. He commenced an action against Wawanesa Insurance Company in 2001. In 2006, the plaintiff commenced an action against the defendant, alleging that the defendant was in breach of contract or negligent for failing to obtain full replacement value insurance coverage for the plaintiff. The defendant filed his defence in April 2007. Mediation took place in September 2010 and examinations for discovery were held in May 2011. At that time, the defendant asked the plaintiff to disclose the amount recovered in the Wawanesa lawsuit and the plaintiff refused. The defendant brought this application for relief that: 1) The plaintiff's action be dismissed for want of prosecution; or 2) The plaintiff be required to disclose the amount recovered in the other lawsuit. The defendant argued that the delays between the issuance of the statement of claim to the examination for discovery and then the delay between the time of mediation to May 2012 when the plaintiff's counsel filed the reply to undertakings were both inordinate.HELD: The Court applied the test established in International Capitol Corp. v. Robinson Twigg &amp; Ketilson to determine whether or not a matter should be struck for want of prosecution. The Court found that the first delay was inordinate but because the plaintiff and defendant both acknowledged that the action against the defendant would only proceed depending on the outcome of the claim against Wawanesa, the delay was excusable. The Court found that the second delay was excessive, but was not sufficient to strike the claim on that basis. Applying the factors provided in Capitol, the Court found:1. Stage of litigation: It did not occur at an early stage of the litigation as the matter could well go to pre-trial conference. 2. Impact of delay: The delay was not causing any problems for the defendant. 3. The context in which the delay occurred: the delay in question was actually only one year during which the plaintiff's counsel did not respond in a timely fashion to undertakings. 4. Reasons offered for delay: Counsel was busy and it had to determine which undertaking could or could not be answered. 5. The role of counsel in causing the delay: The Court held that the delay caused by the plaintiff's counsel should not be a reason to deprive the plaintiff of his claim for actions beyond his control. The Court denied the application to strike the plaintiff's claim but ordered that the plaintiff disclose the amount obtained in the Wawanesa action on the basis that this case fell into the exception to the policy which protects settlement communications. Here, the communications sought by the defendant were relevant and necessary to avoid double recovery.","HELD: The application was granted in the alternative and the plaintiff was required to disclose the amount recovered from its lawsuit with Wawanesa Mutual Insurance. The court found that the delay was inordinate and inexcusable. The plaintiff relied on cases such as Middelkamp v. Fraser Valley Real Estate Board, which set out the principles for determining whether or not a matter should be struck for want of prosecution. The delay from June 2010 to May 2012 really is a delay from May 2011 until May 2012 and solely on the defendant's head of counsel for the plaintiff for not responding in a timely fashion to the undertakings. There were requests for answers to those undertakings culminating in the application. The stage of litigation is at a point where it could well go to pre-trial conference. The defendant is retired from active business, this delay is not causing him any professional embarrassment or damage to reputation. The context in which the delay occurred is prejudice to the defendant."

Based on the applicant's income, his child support payment is reduced from $500 per month to $425 per month.  2) The applicant is in arrears in the amount of $56,365.60.

The application for rescission for arrears is dismissed.","FIAT: The applicant applies pursuant to the Inter-jurisdictional Support Orders Act for a variation of support for the parties' one child, Desiree May Braun-McLaughlan, born February 14, 1992. Mr. McLaughlan seeks both a variation in regard to his ongoing child support payments as well as rescission of arrears which have accumulated under the original child support order. HELD: 1) The respondent resides in British Columbia and the applicant is in Saskatchewan. The respondent was served with this motion in October 2006. It is in the Court's view that the ongoing support payments are currently being paid towards. Given that the respondent is currently earning the sum of $45,784 per year, he can afford to pay reasonable payment. 2) The applicant appears to be suggesting that his payment of ongoing support, and any payment he must make towards arrear, leaves him in financial difficulties, given he has remarried and has two more children. However, in order to allow the rescission application to proceed, would have to determine that he has, firstly, present inability to pay arreaars and, secondly, that he will not in the future be able to pay them. 3) The Court dismissed the respondent's application for rescission. It appears that the applicant has the ability to pay support in some of the years since the order was granted. He was stubborn. The applicant provides no evidence as why he earned little income from 1995 to 1998 and in 2002, and does not, in any way, suggest that he was ill, injured or unable to work for any reasonable reason."

d_2000canlii19583.txt,"The accused was charged with assault causing bodily harm contrary to s.267(b) of the Criminal Code. HELD: The accused was found guilty.  1)The case law from other jurisdictions was reviewed. Given the law as it presently stands in Saskatchewan the Crown does not have an obligation to prove that bodily harm caused by the assault was objectively foreseeable and that the assault would subject the victim to the risk of bodily harm. The Court of Appeal expressly stated that R. v. Nurse was incorrectly decided and prefers the approach in R. v. Brooks which held the elements of assault causing bodily harm consist of the mens rea to commit the assault and the intentional application of force which results in bodily harm. 2)The victim would not have suffered bodily harm if the accused had not assaulted him. The assault was more than an insignificant or trivial cause of the bodily harm. While the bodily harm resulted directly from third parties falling on top of the accused and the victim, the third parties involvement was due entirely and as a direct result of the actions of the accused. It was clearly the accused who initiated the pile up. The accused placed the victim in a dangerous position, similar to that in the Samuelson and Brooks decisions. A very short period of time elapsed between the assault and bodily harm.","The accused was charged with assault causing bodily harm contrary to s. 267(b) of the Criminal Code. The facts as outlined by the accused on his own behalf and by his son-in-law were at variance in material ways. The accused was standing on the walkway at the rear of the seats when the alleged victim, the 15-year-old mascot for the Raider Hockey Club, approached him and punched him in the face. The victim fell to the ground and remained motionless. Less than one minute later the victim was run over and killed by a truck. HELD: The Court held that the jury must conclude that the accused driving was the contributing cause of death outside the deminimus range and that the assault would subject the victim to the risk of bodily harm. 1) The Court expressly stated that Nurse was incorrectly decided. 2) While the bodily harm resulted directly from the effect of third parties falling on top of the accused and Mr. Brown, the third parties involvement was due entirely and as direct result of the actions of the defendant. The defendant placed the victim in a dangerous position, similar to the accused in the Samuelson and Brooks decisions. The Court also held that there was a very short period of time elapsed between the assault and the death. They are, to quote the Samueluelson decision, 'closely related in time and otherwise'. 3) In reviewing case law from other jurisdictions, it is very important to note that given the law as it presently stands in Saskatchewan, the Crown does not have to prove that the primary or secondary causes of death (e.g. the punch in the stomach, the disinterested testimony of the two disinterested witnesses) that led the jury to conclude the kick was a contributing cause and not just a minor or insignificant cause. 4) In the case at bar, two questions must be posed: (1) would the victim have suffered bodily harm if the accused had not assaulted him; (2) was the assault a contributing factor in that it was more than an insignificant or trivial cause; (3) would there have been a pile-up if the assault had not taken place less than 45 seconds to one minute after the assault? The third question should be answered in the affirmative. The second question was asked in relation to the third party. The third unrelated witness, Mark Anderson, did not see the event."

c_2013skqb155.txt,"The Crown appealed a decision of the Provincial Court dismissing an application for a recognizance pursuant to s. 810.2 of the Criminal Code. The judge held that the usual rules of evidence pertaining to criminal trials apply to a s. 810.2 hearing and that records kept by the Correctional Services of Canada (CSC) were inadmissible as business records under s. 30 of the Canada Evidence Act. The respondent had been convicted in 2009 of robbery with violence, assault causing bodily harm, assault and three counts of violating bail. He was sentenced to three years' imprisonment. In May 2010, the CSC referred the respondent's case to the National Parole Board (NPB) with a recommendation that he be detained until warrant expiry, in accordance with s. 129(2) of the Corrections and Conditional Release Act (CCRA). The recommendation was based upon the character of the respondent's offences and where there are reasonable grounds to believe that the offender is likely to commit another offence causing death or serious harm if released on parole. The NPB ordered that the respondent be detained in custody until the expiry of the sentence. Reviewed annually under the CCRA, the CSC prepared another assessment in 2011 and the respondent was not released from custody until March 2012. At that point, a 'warrant expiry package' was prepared by a parole officer, comprised of CSC records relating to the respondent, including a criminal profile report, the assessment for decision reports and copies of the NPB's reasons for ordering detention. These records were sent to the RCMP in Saskatchewan. The officer concerned then swore the information under s. 810.2, stating that he believed that there were reasonable grounds to believe that the respondent would commit a serious personal offence as defined by s. 752 of the Code. The application for a hearing was commenced in August 2012. The parole officer and the RCMP officer were called to testify and the Crown applied to have the documents in the package admitted into evidence, and the respondent opposed the application. The judge refused to allow the admission of the report, the assessment and the NPB reasons for ordering detention based upon R. v. Fontaine and R. v. Toulejour. Based on the business rules exception, the judge held that the criminal report profile was inadmissible because it was a copy and not accompanied by supporting affidavits as required by s. 30(3) of the CEA. HELD: The Court held that the application was allowed. The Supreme Court had confirmed that s. 810 hearings are not criminal trials and that the rules of evidence in criminal trials do not apply. Hearsay evidence is admissible and the judge is to determine whether or not sufficient weight can be given to the hearsay evidence to establish reasonable and probable grounds required for the individual to swear the information to justify the fear of harm to others by the respondent. The Court held that all of the CSC records submitted as part of the package were admissible under the CEA. The Court directed that the matter be returned for a new hearing of the original application.","This is an appeal from the decision of the Provincial Court dismissing an application for a recognizance pursuant to s. 810.2 of the Criminal Code. The issue is whether the usual rules of evidence pertaining to criminal trials apply and that hearsay evidence is not admissible. HELD: The appeal is dismissed. 1) The Court decided based on R. v. Fontaine, 2010 SKPC 16 (CanLII), 356 Sask.R. 330 (O. C.A.). 2) The court found that s.810 hearings are not criminal trials. The court held that records kept by the Correctional Service of Canada (CSC) were inadmissible as business records under s.30 of the Canada Evidence Act. It held that the Crown must establish that the informant actually fears that the defendant will cause personal injury to him and that there are reasonable grounds for the fear. 3) There are many proceedings in our criminal law and Criminal Code that allow evidence that does not meet the admissibility rules prescribed for a criminal trial to be admitted into evidence. The Court found that'satisfied by the evidence adduced' does not require formal sworn evidence such as viva voce evidence commonly used in criminal proceedings. 4) The Crown applied to have the criminal profile report, the assessment for decision reports and the NPB's reasons for ordering detention admitted. The Crown sought to have these documents admitted. 5) The accused's application was dismissed. 6) Hearsay evidence was not admitted. 7) The applicant was not required to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that she or he actually feared that she would suffer personal injury. 8) Hearing transcripts were not admitted as part of the hearing. 9) The application to admit the accused's case to the National Parole Board was granted. 10) The admission of the transcripts was not allowed. 11) Section 810 does not create an offence but rather it seeks to prevent the commission of a criminal offence. It is preventative rather than punitive. 12) The burden of proof is on the Crown and requires proof on a balance of probabilities. The test is both subjective and objective. It must be established (1) that the victim actually fears a bodily harm to him; and (2) reasonable grounds exist for the informant's fear. The standard of review is correctness on a question of law. 13) The principles of review are correctness. They are not meant to be used to make a decision. 14) An application to extradite"
2_2008skca172.txt,"The appellant was tried by Queen's Bench judge sitting alone and found guilty of operating a motor vehicle while his ability to operate the vehicle was impaired by alcohol, thereby causing death contrary to s. 255(3) of the Criminal Code, and causing bodily harm contrary to s. 255(2) of the Code. He was sentenced to 5 years imprisonment after having been given credit of 1 year for the time served on remand. The appellant appeals both his conviction and sentence. On the conviction appeal the appellant raises a technical ground in relation to the manner in which the appellant was charged as well as issues of the propriety and fairness of the cross-examination of himself by Crown counsel, the admissibility of his criminal record at trial, and the admissibility of opinion evidence proved in the testimony of the Crown's expert witness on accident reconstruction. He also argues that the trial judge failed to find that the fact that the appellant was impaired at the time of the collision was the cause of the collision and that his conclusion was unreasonable and against the weight of the evidence. HELD: Appeal dismissed.  1) The trial judge has a discretion pursuant to R. v. Corbett, [1988] 1 S.C.R. 670, to exclude prejudicial evidence of prior convictions in an appropriate case. This discretion is exercised by the trial judge on the application of an accused at the close of the Crown's case. See R. v. Underwood, [1998] 1 S.C.R. 77. As such an application was not raised in this case, and the questioning about previous convictions by the Crown was not objected to when it occurred, and the issue of the appellant's previous alcohol related offences was raised in the appellant's own examination in chief, this court concludes that there is no basis for this Court to conclude that the cross-examination was inappropriate or that the evidence adduced was inadmissible.  2) It is not proper for Crown counsel to ask an accused on cross-examination to explain the testimony of a Crown witness, and that it is highly unfair and prejudicial to require an accused to agree with a Crown witness or stigmatize that witness as a 'liar'. Crown counsel should not have put these sorts of questions and the trial judge ought not to have permitted them. Defence counsel did not object to them. However, this Court is not satisfied that this error had any effect on the trial and this ground of appeal fails.  3) The Crown elicited opinion evidence from Constable Gibson in the area of accident reconstruction. No evidence was at any time offered as to his expertise to do so, other than his curriculum vitae, which was filed. This witness's evidence as to how the bodies might have moved in the vehicle in the course of the collision and its aftermath, and in particular, his conclusory opinion that Ms. McDermott was the passenger and Mr. Bear the driver, ought not to have been received in the absence of a ruling that he was qualified as an expert in relation to those matters, and that his expertise was necessary in relation to the subject matter of his testimony, and that his opinion was based on facts before the Court. 4) The appellant was charged and convicted with offences pursuant to s. 255(2) and s. 255(3) of the Criminal Code. The appellant argues that conviction requires that the appellant has been charged with an offence pursuant to s. 253(a). There is no merit in this ground of appeal. Impaired driving causing death and bodily harm are routinely charged in this manner. 5) This Court's review of the cross-examination of the appellant supports the trial judge's assessment of it as unbelievable. In light of the trial judge's findings of credibility, and the results of the DNA analysis of the samples taken, the evidence overwhelmingly supports the verdict reached by the trial judge that the appellant was driving. The conclusory opinions expressed by Constable Gibson in relation to the movements of the occupants in the truck, and as to who was driving the vehicle, played no meaningful role in a conclusion that was, compelled by the remaining evidence. Notwithstanding the errors apparent in the receipt of opinion evidence from Constable Gibson, there was no substantial miscarriage of justice. The appeal from conviction is dismissed. 6) The trial judge did not commit any error of principle in coming to the conclusion that an appropriate sentence was 6 years imprisonment. While the sentence is at the high end of the available range, it is not outside the range available in the circumstances of this case.","The appellant was convicted of operating a motor vehicle while his ability to operate the vehicle was impaired by alcohol, thereby causing the death of his passenger and causing bodily harm to the driver. The appellant argued that the trial judge erred in sentencing him to five years imprisonment as well as the sentence imposed because the Crown did not object to his cross-examination. The only issue on appeal was whether it was the appellant who was the driver of the truck at the time of the collision. HELD: Appeal dismissed. 1)The trial judge allowed the appellant to be cross-examined on all of his criminal record even though some of his prior convictions were not relevant to the issue of credibility and his admission of that part of the record was therefore more prejudicial than probative. 2)The appellant raised a number of valid objections. The questioning about previous criminal convictions by the Crown was not objected to when it occurred. 3)The defence did not place any weight on the questions or in any way shift the onus of proof to the accused. 4)In all of the circumstances the existence of an alcohol related record was raised by the appellant's own counsel and that the extent to which he had an alcohol problem was put in issue. 5)The Court was not satisfied that the Crown should not have put these questions in issue and therefore failed to do so. The trial judge clearly has discretion, pursuant to Corbett, to exclude prejudicial evidence of prior convictions in an appropriate case. However, for an appeal to succeed on this ground, this Court must conclude that the appellant was prejudiced by the questions."
d_2013skca10.txt,"The appellant plead guilty to two counts of sexual assault, was declared a dangerous offender and sentenced to an indeterminate sentence. The appellant appealed the sentence arguing that the sentencing judge failed to give adequate consideration to the assessment of two expert witnesses who testified that they thought the appellant should be found a long-term offender. HELD: The appeal was dismissed. The sentencing judge was not bound to accept the assessment of the experts. Both experts testified that the appellant's risk to reoffend sexually was moderate to high and was extremely high if he did not receive treatment. Both experts based their opinions, in part, on the idea that the appellant had been a model inmate. Both experts believed the appellant's self report about his behaviour in custody, despite having reached the conclusion that he was a pathological liar. Both experts appeared to take the accused at face value when he said he was motivated to change. In fact, the evidence from correctional officials suggested that the appellant was prone to violent, aggressive and irrational behaviour in custody. He had shown on numerous occasions that he would not follow the rules in the institution and had been involved in several attempts to smuggle drugs into the jail, including picking up a package in the washroom of the court house during his dangerous offender hearing and convincing his lawyer to bring his baby into the jail with drugs in his diaper. The accused had committed two sexual assaults within months of being released from a previous sexual assault sentence. The trial judge was correct to emphasize protection of the public and was entitled to discount the opinion of the experts because it was based on incorrect assumptions. In supporting the sentencing judge's opinion that the accused would not take treatment because he refused to accept responsibility for his offences, the Court of Appeal noted that the accused had stated in his Notice of Appeal that he was serving a life sentence for two sexual assaults that he did not commit and the fact that he sent a letter to the Court saying that he had been falsely accused and did not sexually assault anyone. In addition, the Court considered fresh evidence that the appellant had refused to transfer to another institution in order to participate in high-intensity sex offender treatment pending his appeal.","After the defendant pled guilty to two counts of sexual assault, the Court of Appeal declared him a dangerous offender and sentenced him to an indeterminate sentence. The defendant appealed. He argued that during the dangerous offender hearing the judge failed to give adequate consideration to the assessment of two expert witnesses who both recommended that he be declared a long-term offender and that the defendant not be eligible for programing if he did not accept responsibility for the sexual assaults. He also argued that the Court was not bound to accept the experts' assessment. Appeal dismissed; the defendant was found to be a danger offender because he never had the chance to participate in sexual offender treatment. The evidence showed that defendant's risk to re-offend was substantial and that if he continued to vacillate between accepting and denying responsibility he would not benefit from treatment."
d_2006nsca24.txt,"In the context of a divorce proceeding, the husband filed an interlocutory application for, inter alia, the termination of spousal support, and the sale of the matrimonial home. The Chambers judge ordered that the matrimonial home be sold and the assets equally divided between the spouses. The wife appealed. Appeal allowed; certain provisions of the Order struck or temporarily lifted to permit the parties a reasonable opportunity to make timely alternative arrangements to resolve the matters in issue consensually, short of selling the matrimonial home; the court's intervention was necessary to prevent a patent injustice. There was no mention of any division of matrimonial assets in the notice filed by the husband and in the unique circumstances of this case, it was unrealistic and unfair to address the issue of selling the house without at the same time taking into account its value and the parties' individual contributions to that value.","The husband applied for an interlocutory order that the matrimonial home be sold and the wife to return certain personal belongings. The wife had been cut off her husband's medical insurance coverage, and she needed spousal support. The husband, who maintained a modest pension and investment income, had to live with relatives. He applied to have the home sold and wife's equity divided equally after deducting legal fees and real estate commission from the sale proceeds; and to have bank release him from mortgage obligations. Application allowed; the matter could not be heard again. Findings of credibility were entirely within the province and it might accelerate these proceedings and bring about a more timely conclusion if he were able to hear it."
8_2007skqb419.txt,"In January 1992, the parties agreed the petitioner would pay child support of $300 per month and that it would be without tax ramifications to either party. As of September 2007, the petitioner has arrears of about $2,900. He now applies to set his child support obligation and deal with the arrears. The petitioner claims he has been paying too much in child support under the Guidelines. HELD: 1) In terms of ongoing support, it is appropriate to determine the petitioner's income on the basis of the three year average of his employment income being $21,834 and add to that the $5,100 in rental income for a total of $26,934. The petitioner is actively engaged in farming. He pursues reasonable off farm income. In the absence of something further, the Court was not prepared to impute income. He shall pay child support of $221 per month.  2) In terms of the payor's ability to pay at the time the arrears accrued, the petitioner says he was paying in excess of his legal obligation. It is true that if one looked to his employment income the table amount would be approximately half of the $300 per month non-taxable that the petitioner agreed to pay back in 1992. However, one cannot ignore the fact that he agreed to pay it. He did nothing to seek to change this obligation in all of the intervening years. The petitioner's farming operation affords the petitioner an opportunity to manage his financial affairs. By reporting a farm loss each year, the petitioner in fact pays less tax on his employment income than he would otherwise pay. In the circumstances the Court was not prepared to rescind any of the arrears.","The petitioner seeks an interim order setting his ongoing child support obligation as well as addressing the arrears. Arrears have accumulated and he seeks to expunge them. The petitioner supplements his farm income with working for part of the season at a local sporting store. He has a room mate to share expenses. This generates some rental income. The farming operation has shown a loss in each year. The respondent notes that when the petitioner recently sought financing for the purchase of a half ton truck he indicated his income was $5,100 per month. The farm income is said to be $21,834.00. The Maintenance Enforcement Office is holding funds obtained through federal garnishment. HELD: 1) The child support order of December 11, 1991 was registered in this Court January 27, 1992 pursuant to s. of The Reciprocal Enforcement of Maintenance Orders Act, 1983, S.S. 1983, c.R-4.1 as am. 2) It appears that by early 2006 there was $1,300. He was paying in excess of his legal obligation. It is true that if one looked to his employment income the table amount would be approximately one-half of the $300 per month non-taxable that the petitioner agreed to pay back in 1992. However one cannot ignore the fact that in 1992 the payor agreed to a rate that is greater than his current obligation. He did nothing to seek to change this obligation in all of the intervening years. 3) The petitioner is actively engaged in farming. He pursues reasonable off farm income. In the absence of something further to impute income, the Court will not consider costs. 4) The Court was cognizant of the fact the petitioner's farming operation affords the petitioner an opportunity to manage his financial affairs. 5) Costs were considered."
2011skpc153.txt,The accused was charged with dangerous driving. The evidence established that the accused was observed driving a black Mustang that accelerated quickly from a red light. The police officer observed the vehicle accelerate over a period of two to three blocks and used radar to clock the vehicle's top speed at 140 km/hr. The posted speed limit is 60 km/hr. The intersection was near a church and school yard. There is a bend in the street near where this speeding occurred. HELD: The accused was convicted of dangerous driving. The accused was travelling well over twice the posted speed limit for that portion of roadway. The bend in the road adds to the danger. The accused was driving within the confines of a city and his actions were planned and deliberate. His conduct is a marked departure from the standard expected of a reasonably prudent driver.,"The accused was charged with operating a motor vehicle on a highway in a manner that was dangerous to the public contrary to s.249(1)(a) of the Criminal Code. HELD: The accused was found guilty. The evidence was straightforward and uncontradicted. The accused voluntarily undertook to drive his vehicle and accelerate to this rate of speed on this stretch of road for a short period of time, in a marked departure from the standard expected for reasonably prudent drivers. The driving must be planned and deliberate. The mens rea is inferred from the driving conduct."
8_2008skqb481.txt,"FIAT: The applicant seeks an order setting aside a wage assessment certificate issued by the Director of the Labour Standards Branch (the Director) and filed with this Court. The applicant disputes liability for the amount set out in the wage assessment and claim that he inadvertently and innocently missed the time within which to file an appeal. The issues are whether this Court has jurisdiction to set aside the Director's certificate filed with the Court of Queen's Bench, if so what criteria ought to be applied in determining whether the Court should exercise its discretion and whether the applicant has satisfied the criteria. HELD: 1) Even though an appeal from a wage assessment to the appeals board and an appeal from an adjudicator to the Court of Queen's Bench both require 'appeals' within '21 days', an appeal to the Court of Queen's Bench is a true appeal while an 'appeal' to the appeals board is essentially a request for a de novo hearing. Consequently, this Court concludes that the consequences of missing the time limitation are not necessarily the same. 2) This Court does have jurisdiction to deal with an applicant's request, on a director appeal, because it is not a 'true appeal' that questions a decision made by an independent adjudicator after a hearing. Accordingly, the reasoning of this Court in Farmers of North America Inc. v. Langridge, 2004 SKQB 375, is not applicable. A finding that this Court is without jurisdiction to set aside a judgment, obtained without any independent adjudicative process, regardless of the basis upon which that judgment was obtained, is inequitable and at odds with existing practices and procedures. Section 62.4(4) of The Labour Standards Act states that a certificate filed pursuant to s. 62.4(3) has the same force and effect as if it were a judgment obtained in the Court of Queen's Bench for the recovery of a debt. This Court certainly would have jurisdiction to determine whether or not the applicant's application to open up a noting for default should be granted pursuant to Rule 114(3), Rule 271 and Rule 346. It follows that this Court is able to look behind the filing and examine the circumstances under which that judgment was entered. The Court of Queen's Bench is a superior Court charged with the administration of justice and enjoys inherent as well as statutory jurisdiction. This inherent jurisdiction cannot be removed by either level of government without constitutional amendment. 3) It is fair and equitable to apply, by analogy, the principles and resulting rules formulated relating to opening up a default judgment to the applicant's request to set aside the judgment registered in circumstances where he has failed to file an appeal disputing a wage assessment to the registrar of appeals.  4) The evidence is that the applicant is a businessman running a commercial enterprise in Foam Lake. It is expected that somebody in his position would have the savvy to read, review and understand the document, or at least seek assistance from someone who could help him. The applicant either failed or declined to read, or chose to ignore, the plain language of the documents served on him by registered mail. This amounts to wilful blindness at the very least. Numerous cases hold that wilful blindness is not sufficient reason to set aside a noting for default. In these circumstances the Court is not prepared to exercise its discretion in favour of setting aside the Director's certificate filed as a judgment of this Court.","FIAT: The applicant brings an application seeking an order setting aside a certificate issued by the Director of the Labour Standards Branch (the Director) and filed with the Court of Queen's Bench. The applicant disputes liability for the amount set out in the wage assessment and claims that he inadvertently and innocently missed the time within which to file an appeal. He seeks to set aside the certificate, which has been registered as judgment of this Court, on the same basis that the Court would open up noting for default or set aside default judgment. The Director takes the position that the applicant has not met the criteria necessary to trigger the exercise of the Court's discretion. HELD: 1) The certificate is properly issued as permitted by s. 62.4(1)(a). There is no dispute as to whether the applicant was served with the documentation by registered mail. The registered letter clearly stipulates that should the applicant wish to appeal he must take certain steps within 21 days. 2) There are at least two bases upon which it can be found that it could be found the Court is clothed with jurisdiction to exercise its discretion and provide remedy in appropriate circumstances. The principles and the rules that flow from them and which have developed in relation to the opening up of noting for a default and in setting aside default judgments ought not to be set aside. However, virtually any judgment is set aside with merely a bald assertion by an applicant that he did not appreciate the seriousness or impact of the documentation served upon him. Simply stating that, 'I thought my letter of April 21, 2008 would be sufficient...' and 'I did not realize that had to take further action' is not sufficient explanation for his failure to meet the criteria. The fact that the document appeared to be formal in nature and upon receipt the applicant most certainly ought to have taken measures to determine what it was that he needed do as result of being served with that document. The document itself contained all the information the applicant would have needed to process the appeal."
9_2008skca107.txt,"This appeal arises from a dispute between the appellant, Dr. Huerto and the respondent Government of Saskatchewan, over the payment for medical services provided by Dr. Huerto to his patients. Over a period of approximately 10 years, the Government withheld payment in relation to what eventually amounted to some 12,000 of the appellant's accounts. The Government indicated through the use of a billing code, that the accounts would not be paid until further information was provided. The appellant believed the use of the billing code was unlawful and chose not to provide additional information. He started an action in the Court of Queen's Bench to compel payment of his accounts. His claim was largely dismissed on the basis that the action was premature. The appellant appeals from the Queen's Bench ruling and the Government cross-appeal in relation to the limited aspect of the case in which Dr. Huerto enjoyed success. HELD: Appeal and Cross-appeal dismissed.  1) Section 17(1)(c) of The Saskatchewan Medical Care Insurance Act is to the effect that the intention and purpose of the Act is not to establish a medical care insurance plan under which 'the exercise of professional judgment by physicians is in any way diminished'. This broad statement of principle should not be read so aggressively as to mean the Government, as the payor in a publicly funded health care system, has no right to ask questions about the accounts presented for payment by physicians. The Government has not denied payment of the appellant's accounts. Nor has it received the requested information from the appellant. The actions (the Protocol) taken by the Government cannot be characterized as an amendment of the Payment Schedule. The Protocol is an administrative tool which sets out the situations in which the appellant will be asked for further information about the provision of specific services. This is fully in line with the terms of the Schedule. 2) Section 5(1) of the Regulations should not be read as meaning the Government is entitled to ask for additional information about a service if, and only if, the nature of the service is 'unusual'. Rather, it simply stipulates that additional remarks must be included in an account rendered with respect to an unusual service. This does not imply the government can request extra information only in relation to an unusual service. A physician's obligation to include certain material in an account and the Government's authority to ask for additional information are ultimately two quite different things. 3) The Court does not accept that the appellant's claims were barred by s. 16(1) of the Act. It would be perverse to read the Act as requiring that, in order for an account to be paid, every bit of information demanded by the Government through the use of a billing code, or otherwise, must be supplied before the expiration of the 6 month period established by the Regulations. An account submitted the day before the expiration of the 6 month deadline would be voided by the application of the billing code. An account submitted well in advance of the expiration of the 6 month period would also be effectively denied if a request for further information was not made until at or near the end of the six month time limit, with the result that there was insufficient time for a physician to respond before that limit was exceeded. These potential problems are especially troublesome because there is an element of subjectivity in the application of the Protocol and even the most diligent physician might not accurately anticipate when an account or accounts will attract a request for extra comment. 4) The Court cannot accept the Government's submission that the trial judge should have declined to deal with the appellant's claim because the appellant had not fully pursued possible appeals to the Medical assessment Board. The Legislature in s. 40(3) of the Act has expressly provided that the appeal procedure established pursuant to the Act does not prejudice a physician's right to pursue matters in the courts. It stands entirely at odds with the notion that the appeal procedures in the Act should be read as being comprehensive and exhaustive.","Dr. Huerto commenced an action in the Court of Queen's Bench to compel payment of his accounts for medical services provided by the Government of Saskatchewan. Over a period of approximately 10 years, the Government withheld payment in relation to what eventually amounted to some 12,000 accounts. He appealed from the Queen’s Bench ruling which held that the Government had no authority to create an individualized payment schedule for physician services. He argued the payment schedule was best characterized by a unilateral amendment of the Payment Schedule, which allowed the Government to request more information about the services underpinning the accounts and in appropriate situations to deny payment. The Government cross-appealed, arguing both the Protocol and the MCIA code are invalid because they amount to an attempt to regulate his pattern of practice. The Protocol is not inconsistent with s. 17(1)(c). However, the reality is that most physicians have the option of either working wholly outside the publicly funded health care plan, billing patients directly or having the patients seek reimbursement from the Government or submitting accounts directly to the Government for payment. Most physicians opt for the third approach. HELD: The appeal was dismissed and the cross appeal dismissed. Both the appeal and the appealeal must be dismissed.  1) The principles of the Protocol are best characterized as 'a means by which MCIB, on behalf of the Government, can request further information in circumstances where there are concerns about the relationship between the service covered by an account and other services. Such matters, according to the physician, can only be addressed through a JMPRC established pursuant to s. 49.2 of The Saskatchewan Medical Care Insurance Payment Regulations (the Regulations). 2) In order to resolve this appeal it is necessary to understand the broad outline of the scheme which governs payment for physician Services in Saskatchewan. 3) There are situations where the Government has the right to ask for additional information before agreeing to pay an account. The aspects of the protocol relating to the AU code operationalize that right in the circumstances of the physician's unusual practice. In this case, the physician chose not to respond to the requests for further information, or to make any reasonable effort to do so. 4) The payment schedule is best characterized, perhaps among other things, as a central feature of the payment regime. It does not lead to the imposition of tariffs or increased costs. 5) The application of the standard protocol ties directly into the 'Assessment Rules' portion of the Schedule. The standard rules in this regard do not create special rules that are not found in"
4_2005nssc253.txt,"The plaintiff in a rear end motor vehicle accident applied for summary judgment and an interim payment. The defendant argued that there was an arguable issue to be tried in that even if one accepted the plaintiff's evidence, there was the issue of contributory negligence to be considered. The defendant also argued that he did not see any brake lights on the plaintiff's vehicle and thus there was an issue as to whether or not they were working. Application for summary judgment granted as to liability with damages to be assessed; application for interim payment dismissed. There was no 'air of reality' to the defence; to strike the plaintiff's vehicle from behind on these facts meant that the defendant was travelling too close or didn't have proper care or control of his vehicle. However, the affidavit evidence showed that there were several other factors affecting the plaintiff's health besides the injuries sustained in the motor vehicle accident; serious issues existed between the parties at to whether or not the plaintiff's injuries sustained in the motor vehicle accident resulted in any ongoing inability to work in any capacity; any amount of assessed damages which might be arrived at would largely depend upon credibility and the medical evidence at trial.","The Plaintiff made a significant claim for summary judgment pursuant to Civil Procedure Rule 13.01 and an interim payment was made under Rule 31.01. The defendant argued that there had to be an 'air of realty' to the Plaintiff's argument as she had not been able to establish that the motor vehicle accident resulted in her suffering injuries. The plaintiff appealed. Appeal allowed; judgment entered against the defendant as to liability with damages to be assessed.  1)It is not the function of the Court in determining the matter of interim payment to make findings of credibility or even to dwell on them. The Court must be cautious in assessing the likely recovery of a plaintiff in the early stages of litigation particularly where there is a lack of medical opinion in the discovery of experts where necessary. 2)The evidence submitted by way of the plaintiff's affidavits causes the Court difficulty. If the plaintiff stopped abruptly and there is no arguable issue to be tried with respect to her claim, one has to consider the issue of contributory negligence. The bald statement in the pleadings does not disclose the existence of an actual or probable defence and cannot fend off an application for summary judgement. 3)The Plaintiff's injuries were minor. On reading the reports of her doctor and the doctor's report, one finds there are significant other factors affecting the health of the Plaintiff. There must be an air of reality to the defendant's arguments. 4)Any amount of assessed damages which might be arrived at will depend largely upon credibility and the medical evidence at trial. The Defendant argues there has yet to even be an independent medical examination. 5)Costs in the cause of the action were entered against both parties."
d_2006nssc73.txt,"Custodial arrangements for the parties two youngest children (aged 15 and 13), who currently lived with the father the majority of the time, were at issue. The marriage had been traditional, with the wife being the primary caretaker of the children. Both children were heavily involved in sporting activities and the father felt that since he was retired, he would be better able to ensure their attendance at various games and practices. The mother, who had recently commenced employment as a social worker, felt that the current interim arrangement was difficult for the children in that they would forget their school books at the other parent's residence and were sometimes left alone for extended periods at the father's residence. Children placed in the custody and primary care of the mother; until the separation, the mother had been the primary caretaker of the children and she appeared to have a stronger emotional bond with them; the father had been physically, emotionally and verbally abusive to the wife throughout the marriage and seemed incapable of putting the children's needs above his own; and the mother was much more likely than the father to encourage the children to have contact with the other parent. Although the father was retired and might have more time to spend with the children, this did not outweigh all of the other factors.","The parties were married for four years and had four children. They separated in October 2004 after the petitioner (who was working part-time and lived with her mother when she was not attending university) filed a counter-petition for divorce. The parties have four children from their first marriage. The petitioner is the primary parent and the primary caregiver to the children. The respondent is 65 years old and retired. He lives in a three bedroom apartment in Lower Sackville approximately 10 minutes walk from the children's school. The two older children stay with their mother when they are away from their school, and the parties' two younger children move in with her each week. HELD: The children have been in the respondent's custody and primary care for most of their lives. There is no possibility of reconciliation between the parties. The court will retain jurisdiction to make final disposition regarding all corollary issues and with respect to child support and costs. 1) The respondent's evidence all too frequently gravitated to what he considered to be his wife's transgressions and issues relating to money. The Court accepted his evidence that he did not help with the care of the children particularly during the marriage when they were attending university. 2) There was considerable disagreement between the parents regarding the custody arrangements. It would be in the best interests of the child to remain in the custody of their mother and to have custody arrangements in place knowing that it was only an Interim Order.  3) The court was asked to determine the views of the parties regarding their living arrangements and to take into account the willingness of the petitioner to facilitate such contact. The judge generally provides the Court with recommendation based on her interviews. The evidence is just one of many factors that the Court takes into account when determining what is in the children’s best interests. 4) The parties were awarded joint custody of the four children under the terms of the Divorce Act and the 'best interests' test in that it is an objective test, albeit one which is to be applied according to the evidence in the case."

HELD: The application was dismissed with costs to the respondents in any event of the cause. The applicant did not demonstrate an entitlement to injunctive relief on the second and third stages of the three stage test. The applicant demonstrated there was a serious question to be tried but failed to demonstrate it would suffer irreparable harm. The delay (the action was commenced February 16, 1998) was considered. On balance the respondents would suffer greater harm if the injunction were granted as the respondent Nylen makes his living marketing and selling potassium sulphate.","The plaintiff sought injunctive relief and an order prohibiting the defendant from marketing and manufacturing potassium sulphate and restraining the two defendants from selling, marketing or otherwise disposing of it during the life of the injunction. The defendant argued that the plaintiff had a proprietary interest in the scientific principles of ion exchange and crystallization and that it had deliberately failed to obtain sufficient assurances that Big Quill's system was efficient enough for its needs. HELD: The defendant was prohibited from marketing or selling any potassium sulfate produced at the plaintiff's plant pursuant to the Technology Licensing Agreement and pursuant to Queen's Bench Rule No. 387(a). The factual foundation upon which the applicant relies is that the defendant Alsask entered into the technology licensing agreement in 1997 with the view to considering the defendant's application. The evidence obtained by the plaintiff is that it only obtained documentation in 1995 sufficient to confirm the design of the plant and the flow charts of the process being used to produce the potassium sulphates. The plaintiff was also aware prior to the commencement of the action that it would not be having the defendant market its product to the plaintiff. Further, the plaintiff was aware at the time that it was being approached by the defendant that it might be possible for the defendant to develop a new technology that could be used to meet his or her marketing needs."

e_2010skqb108.txt,"The plaintiffs have applied for certification of proposed multi-jurisdictional class action involving Paxil, prescription drug approved in Canada for the treatment of depression, anxiety, panic disorder and other conditions. The plaintiffs claim that Paxil is ineffective and harmful to persons under 18 years of age. The defendant applies for leave to cross-examine the representative plaintiff on his affidavit pursuant to Rule 317 of The Queen's Bench Rules. HELD: The decisions reviewed by the Court all support the view that leave to cross-examine under Rule 317 is granted more readily in proposed class actions than it is in other civil proceedings. None support the proposition that proposed representative plaintiff is immune from cross-examination in respect of his or her individual claim. Cross-examination of proposed representative plaintiff may explore matters pertaining to his or her individual claim in the context of issue that must be determined by the court pursuant to s. and s. 6.1 of The Class Actions Act. A cross-examination of the plaintiff in this case may assist the court in applying the criterion set out in s. 6 and s. 6.1 of The Class Actions Act.

The plaintiffs claim that Paxil is ineffective and harmful to persons under 18 years of age. An affidavit filed by the respondent indicates that he took Paxil when he was under 18. The respondent applies for leave to cross-examine him on his affidavit. HELD: The application for certification is granted. The court has a relatively wide discretion in relation to the requirement in ss. 6(d) of the Saskatchewan Act that a class action be the preferable procedure and that cross-examination on an affidavit will not result in an injustice to the respondent. There are a number of statements contained in the respondent's affidavit that invite clarification. Taken as a whole, they are relevant to issues that must be determined by the Court under ss.6 and 6.1 of The Class Actions Act. The issues to be resolved on certification application are complex and trial of an issue is not practical alternative where there is conflict in the evidence. However, the desirability of providing a complete picture of the proposed action, including the scope of the issues raised both in the claim and in defence, has generally been viewed by the courts as helpful in determining whether class action is the preferable route."
e_1991canlii4217.txt,"The plaintiff appealed the defendant's decision to grant a partial tax refund only under the Health Services Tax Act. The plaintiff had sought a full refund of tax paid on refrigeration equipment at a pickled herring plant (whose product was to be supplied on contract overseas) on the ground the equipment was used in the 'manufacture or production of goods for sale.' The contract stipulated that most of the processing occur at controlled cold temperatures. The defendant apportioned tax based on the time the equipment was used in the actual 'transformation or conversion' of the product. For the plaintiff, that (1) the tax exemption did not depend on the extent to which the equipment was used in the manufacturing process; and (2) since the contract required most of the process to occur under refrigeration, the use of a cold room was part of the 'manufacture or production' of the product.","Continental Seafoods applied for a refund of health services tax paid on refrigeration equipment which was installed in a new facility for pickled whole herring. The contract contained stringent quality specifications governing the processing of the product which included a phase where the pickling occurs in a cooler facility for 28 to 45 days at a strictly controlled temperature of 0ºC to ‑2ºC. The applicant argued that this was a new matter, not presented by the parties or considered by the Minister, and was not proper consideration on appeal. The appellant appealed. Allowing the appeal and awarding the appellant's costs, that in order to be eligible for exemption from health services taxes pursuant to s. 10(1)(h)(i) of the Act, machinery and equipment must be used in the actual transformation or conversion of product actually being produced for sale. Machinery or equipment used prior or subsequent to that actual transformation is not eligible for the tax exemption. The essence of the decision was that as part of the refrigeration process only, a significant part of its processing was used, he could exempt that portion and tax the rest. The appeal was allowed and the assessment for health services taxed was upheld. The respondent's contention that the Minister and the Commissioner were incorrect in not allowing the exemption in full was rejected. It was inappropriate to apportion the tax to be refunded if the equipment is exempt and is used in any degree in the manufacturing process."
3_2000canlii19624.txt,"The accused was charged with operating a motor vehicle while impaired contrary to s.255(1) and s.253(a) of the Criminal Code and with having consumed alcohol in such a quantity that his blood alcohol concentration exceeded .08 contrary to s.253(b) and s.255(1). The accused contended his right to be secure against unreasonable search and seizure as guaranteed by s.8 of the Charter and his right not to be arbitrarily detained or imprisoned as guaranteed by s.9 of the Charter were breached. In issue was whether the RCMP officer had the jurisdiction to carry out his duties as a peace officer in the City of Prince Albert; if so, was he acting in the lawful execution of his duties in conducting random stop. HELD: The accused was found guilty of driving with a blood alcohol level greater than .08. A judicial stay was entered in relation to the impaired count on which he would have been found guilty if it were necessary. 1)The language used by Parliament in the Royal Mounted Police Act is clear, broad and unambiguous as it was their obvious intention to create a police force that operates without jurisdictional barriers throughout the entire country of Canada. When there is a limitation on their duties it is clearly stated. The Police Act does not mention any exclusivity between one force and another. Given the ultra vires statute construction doctrine it would not be appropriate for provincial legislation to take away powers given by the Federal legislation. The Police Act must be read in context as providing a manner of funding policing not a manner of taking away jurisdiction granted to RCMP officers. 2)The law is now clear that the police can detain vehicles as long as they do so for the purposes of checking for sobriety, licences, ownership, insurance and other mechanical fitness of motor vehicles. The R. v. Emke decision is outdated. 3)The officer was acting in the lawful execution of his duty. There was no breach of the accused's rights under the Charter.","The accused was charged with two counts of impaired driving contrary to s. 255(1) and s. 253(a) of the Criminal Code and one count of driving over the legal limit in violation of s. 27(5) of The Highway Traffic Act. The accused argued that his Charter rights were breached because he displayed an out of date sticker on his vehicle. The officer had engaged the police lights in the city and observed the vehicle hit the curb, bounced off the curb and then proceeded to stop within 30 feet of the accused. The police officer concluded that the accused's ability to operate a motor vehicle was impaired and arrested him at 11:50 p.m. on a routine check. He made the demand for samples of his breath, read him his charter rights, asked him if he wished to call a lawyer and found the officer was not acting in the lawful execution of his duty and found that the words 'are assigned' refer to the three distinct objects and not to specific areas of jurisdiction where Royal Canadian Mounted Police officers are employed within the province. On these facts, the accused blew 170 and 160 respectively on the breathalyser tests and on the three tests. The Court concluded that both offences were charges and that both accused were entirely within the scope of their duties."

Solicitor and client fees totaled over $21,000. Costs fixed at $10,000 plus disbursements; there was no obligation on the defendant to admit liability but considering the amount of legal fees incurred in relation to the amount recovered, it was appropriate to go outside the tariffs.","Counsel had been unable to agree on costs after a four day trial. The plaintiffs were successful in recovering the base amount claimed but did not succeed in their claims for aggravated and punitive damages. The defendant proposed that costs be substantially increased above the usual party and party costs because, as he contended, the defendant ought to have admitted liability at the outset rather than forcing the plaintiffs to trial. Counsel proposed that the court fix costs in the amount of $15,000 plus disbursements. Counsel's fees totaled $18,705 plus H.S.T. of $2,957.83 for a total of $21,663.48.

The defendant had filed for bankruptcy and argued that under s.168.1 of the Bankruptcy and Insolvency Act, he is discharged from all debts except matters referred to in subsection 178(1) of that Act.S. 238(1) of the Income Tax Act, falls within the definition of any fines, penalties, and restitution order as set out in s. 178(1) of the Bankruptcy and Insolvency Act.  The Court's jurisdiction to make an order pursuant to s. 238(1) of the Income Tax Act is unaffected by a bankruptcy proceeding.","The respondent entered guilty pleas to 12 counts under the Income Tax Act failing to remit to the Receiver General, money deducted and withheld from salaries, wages or other remuneration paid to the employees of Halifax Regional Protection Services Limited (HMPS) and received a Certificate of Discharge pursuant to the provisions of S.168.1 of the Bankruptcy and Insolvency Act, discharging and releasing him from all debts except matters referred to in section 178(1) of that Act and included in part of the indebtedness to HMPS as part of his indebtedness. At issue was whether the Crown have jurisdiction to issue an order pursuant to s. 238(2) of the Income tax Act ordering payment of the amount of $22,069.23 to the receiver general and if do, whether such an order should be made. HELD: The Crown's position that the liability of $250,053, $0 assets and the ability to pay by the respondent was relevant, but the guilty pleas represented either a waiver or an acceptance that these defences and limitations did not apply to his liability under s. 242 of the ITA nor the sentence to be imposed pursuant to S. 238 of the Act. The Crown need not establish the existence of the matters set out in s. 227.1(2). The evidence and submissions did not reveal whether the accountant or investor were officers, directors or shareholders in HMPS. It was concluded that the accountant and the investor were relying upon an investor of H.R.P.S. and/or the accountant of that company to make the deductions and necessary remittances and that suggests either of these individuals were at least equally, if not more, responsible for these offences."
4_2017skqb205.txt,"Civil Procedure – Queen’s Bench Rules, Rule 3-72, Rule 3-84Statutes – Interpretation – Enforcement of Money Judgments Act, Section 5, Section 8 The proposed plaintiff, Alternatifbank (Abank) applied pursuant to Queen’s Bench rules 3-72 and 3-84 to be added as a plaintiff to the action of the plaintiff, Sekerbank, against the defendants and to amend the statement of claim. ABank asserted a debt claim against the defendants. The defendants applied pursuant to s. 8 of The Enforcement of Money Judgments Act (EMJA) to terminate the preservation order, which prohibited any dealings with 850,000 shares, or alternatively they sought an order reducing the number of shares subject to the order and requiring the plaintiff to post $3 million as security pursuant to s. 5(7) of the EMJA and $40,000 security for costs. Regarding ABank’s application, it argued that its claim in debt against the defendant arose out of the same transaction based on the allegation that Arslan transferred the shares to a trust (the other defendant was the trustee) in June 2013, the time at which he stopped paying his debts in full and thus denied it the opportunity to collect its debt. ABank sought the same relief as Sekerbank: judgment against both defendants under The Fraudulent Preferences Act and The Fraudulent Conveyances Act. The defendants argued that the limitation period that applied to ABank’s claim had expired and the application should be denied. Regarding the defendants’ application, they argued that the plaintiff’s strategy in the Saskatchewan action was to await the outcome of the proceedings they had initiated in Turkey against the plaintiff. The Saskatchewan action was independent from the Turkish action, and the plaintiff’s approach was unacceptable in the circumstances of the preservation order made against them in 2014. The plaintiff had not prosecuted its actions against them without delay as required by s. 5(c) of the EMJA. The defendants asserted that the share prices increased since 2014 and were now worth $18 million more than the plaintiff’s claim. If the preservation was not terminated, they requested that the number of shares be reduced to 100,000. HELD: The proposed plaintiff’s application was granted. The defendants’ application to terminate the preservation order or to reduce the number of shares subject to the order was dismissed. The court ordered the plaintiff to post $1 million as security under the EMJA and an additional $40,000 as security for costs. The court found that although the limitation period had expired, it would add ABank as a plaintiff and amend the statement of claim pursuant to s. 20 of The Limitations Act, because to do so would not create a wholly new proceeding and the defendants had not provided evidence that they would suffer prejudice. The preservation order was not terminated after the court reviewed the history of the proceedings in both Saskatchewan and Turkey and found that the plaintiff had not failed to prosecute its action without delay. The court found that there was insufficient evidence to justify the reduction in the number of shares subject to the order.  The information of the value of the security fell short of demonstrating a sufficient change in circumstances, especially in light of the addition of ABank’s claim. The court found that the order should be modified under s. 5(7) of the EMJA to have the plaintiff provide security because there was evidence that the trust may have suffered and could suffer losses in the future as a result of the order. The order for security for costs was justified based on the considerations specified in Queen’s Bench rule 4-24.","The defendants applied to terminate the preservation order and seek an order reducing the number of shares subject to the order and requiring the plaintiff to post $3,081,463.14 as security pursuant to s. 5(7) of the Enforcement of Money Judgments Act and $40,000 security for costs. The first application was denied. The second application was granted in part. The defendants argued that there was sufficient temporal and factual relationship between the occurrences on which the original claim was based and those that would permit a termination of the order. HELD: The preservation order was terminated and the statement of claim amended.  1)The application to add the plaintiff was dismissed.  2)The Court was not satisfied that neither of the defendants would suffer actual prejudice as a result of the proposed amendments. The failure to prosecute an action without delay could call for the termination of a preservation order. There are certainly circumstances in which a failure by a plaintiff to prosecute its claim without delay would cause a delay of at least 3 years. However, not every delay meets that mark. The court must consider the extent of and reasons for the delay, in the context of the legislation and in the circumstances of the application.  3)In the first application the defendants applied on the basis that it engaged s. 20 of The Limitations Act. They were correct to do so. The amendment would have allowed the addition of the plaintiff and the escrow agent, as escrow agents, to take part in the preservation proceedings. 4)The preservation order remained in effect until the court rendered a final decision on the merits of the applicant's claim against the defendant and after a hearing scheduled for June 2016. 5)The amendments would not create a wholly new proceeding.  6)The court was also required to exercise its discretion to order the plaintiff added as a plaintiff, and to amend the Statement of Claim."
b_2007skqb388.txt,"The accused was found not guilty of having care or control of a motor vehicle while his blood alcohol content was over .08. The certificate of analysis was excluded as a result of the trial judge's decision that the accused's s. 8 Charter Rights had been violated. The trial judge found that the officer did not have reasonable and probable grounds to make the breathalyzer demand. HELD: The trial judge erred in determining that in the totality of the circumstances it was not objectively reasonable for the officer to have relied on the accuracy of the ASD test. A new trial is ordered.  1) There is no fixed rule or formula that an officer must follow when determining whether or not to wait 15 minutes prior to administering a road side test. In this case, the trial judge appears to have concluded that the officer who administered the ASD would not have relied on the results, or should not have so relied, if her partner had informed her of the empty beer can with fresh suds in it that he found at the scene. Implicit in this finding is the conclusion that the existence of the beer can would make a difference to the officer's assessment of whether she should wait 15 minutes for any mouth alcohol to dissipate before she could rely on ASD test results. 2) The trial judge made the same error that was dealt with by the Ontario Court of Appeal in R. v. Einarson. 3) The accused told the officer that he had been drinking in the car 'earlier'. Even if the officer had been told of her partner's discovery of an empty beer can at the scene, it would not constitute 'credible evidence' that the accused consumed alcohol within that 15 minute time frame. Whether or not the accused had consumed beer within 15 minutes of taking the test on the ASD is pure speculation.","HELD: The appeal was allowed and the acquittal set aside. The trial judge erred in determining that in the totality of the circumstances it was not objectively reasonable for the officer to have relied on the accuracy of the ASD test. The evidence was excluded because the trial judge concluded that contrary to s. 8 of the Charter the officer did not have reasonable and probable grounds to make the breathalyzer demand and further, that pursuant to s24(2) the Charter, the admission of the certificate of analysis could bring the administration of justice in disrepute. A new trial must therefore be held and is ordered to determine whether the officer was entitled to rely on the results of the screening device test in deciding whether he had reasonable and possible grounds to arrest the respondent when he knew there was a possibility that the respondent had consumed alcohol within the 15 minutes prior to the administrationof the test and that if she had, the result of the test could be inaccurate."
d_2013skqb394.txt,"HELD: The Court held that the replacement of former Queen’s Bench rule 212 requiring the production of documents “relating” to any matter in question and rule 222 permitting examination for discovery “touching” the matter in issue in the action by new rules 5-6, 5-18 and 5-25, which use the phrase: “relevant to any matter in issue”, showed the intention that the broad relevance test was no longer applicable. The test under the new Rules was whether the matter qualifies as being material to the action based upon the matter as pled and whether the evidence tends to prove or disprove the matter in issue. This inquiry must be balanced against the notion of proportionality set out in the foundational rules. The Court dismissed the application, excepting the requested order under 3) wherein the defendant would fulfill its undertaking to have certain employees provide responses. With respect to the rest of the relief requested under 1), which involved the undertaking that the defendant would search its records regarding the loading of railcars, the Court held that the as matter was not an issue in the action, based upon a review of the claim as pled. Having regard to proportionality under the new rules, the defendant should not be required to answer the question in light of the effort and expense required versus the possible benefits. The Court held that the plaintiffs were not entitled to ask the defendants to review a binder containing hundreds of pages of invoices assembled by the plaintiff regarding its expenditures incurred as a result of the derailment in order for it to advise the plaintiff which invoices the defendant believed were not related to it. It was the plaintiff’s burden to prove its damages and the defendant was not required to assist the plaintiff to do so. The plaintiff’s requested undertaking for the defendant to provide any background documents and information that went into the preparation of sketch of the railcar in question by the defendant’s adjuster was also denied. The adjuster’s file was subject to litigation privilege and unless it was tendered as evidence at trial, there was no implied waiver of that privilege. Regarding the plaintiff’s request in 2), the Court agreed with the defendants that that plaintiff’s request that the defendant answer questions now, rather than after it had completed questioning of the plaintiff, was premature. The defendant had not yet taken a position on the cause of the derailment and they would advise the plaintiff when they had developed one. Rule 5-31 makes it an ongoing obligation to correct answers and there was no evidence in this application that the rules had not been complied with. The Court awarded costs in the amount of $1,500 to the defendants due to the complexity of the application, requiring the submission of briefs of law and the amount of time taken to argue them matters in Chambers.","FIAT: The plaintiff has applied to the Court seeking orders that the defendants, Clarke Transport and Clarke Transport Inc. (Clarke) answer certain questions which they refused to answer on discovery. The application raises interesting issues with respect to the proper scope of questioning or examination for discovery. HELD: The application is dismissed. 1) There is no implied waiver of litigation privilege that otherwise attaches to the foundational information leading to the preparation of a sketch. The Court found that when an expert takes the witness stand or the expert's file is tendered into evidence there is an implied waiver that the information in the plaintiff's file which is foundational to the opinion is not an issue. 2) The Court determined that the matter of railcars previously loaded by Clarke is not within the proper Scope of questioning. The court found that the implied waiver should be narrowly construed and the privilege should be maintained where it is fair to do so, and any implied waiver must be restricted to material relating to the formulation of the expressed opinion."

The applicant submits that it would be a conflict of interest for the lawyer, who took part in the collaborative law process, to continue to represent the applicant as the issues between the parties have not been settled. HELD: The application is granted. The court ordered that the solicitor withdraw as counsel and that the applicant should return as counsel to the parties by April 28, 2006. 1) The court found that the conflict in the facts was apparent at the initial application.

The plaintiff asserts he is involved in Union related litigation and is thus entitled to the benefit of the indemnity clause. HELD: The plaintiff's application for summary judgment is dismissed. The within action is dismissed in full. 1) The essential nature of the debate between the plaintiff and the Union relates to the interpretation of the indemnity clause in the Union bylaws. This is precisely the type of internal dispute that is not within the exclusive realm of the Labour Relations Board. The forum for this contest is the Queen's Bench Court and this Court has jurisdiction to entertain his claim under Queen's Bench Rule 485 for summary judgment. 2) The plaintiff represents himself. He has incurred no legal fees, other than disbursements, but he nonetheless asserts that he is entitled to $50,000. The figure of $50,000 is proffered by the plaintiff as an appropriate sum as he expects the defendant has spent at least that much defending all four actions. 3) It is plain and obvious that the plaintiff's claim is grounded on an interpretation of the indemnity clause that is so illogical and inconsistent with its plain wording that it cannot succeed.

The Union counterclaim against the plaintiff for breach of the indemnity by-law is part and parcel of strategy to defend the officers who were sued by the plaintiff. HELD: 1) In the absence of a statutory regime precluding the Court's involvement, the debate in the Fourth Action is indistinguishable from the dispute in McNairn. The essential nature of the debate between Taylor and the Union relates to the interpretation of the terms of the union membership contract in sum, the very type of debate contemplated by the Supreme Court in Berry v. Pulley. 2) The Union submits that there are two key reasons why the plaintiff is not entitled to be indemnified: the indemnity clause was not intended to be used to initiate actions but rather to defend actions or proceedings; and 3) the plaintiff was not an executive officer at the relevant time or was not acting in his/her duties as an Executive Officer when he made the comments and published the material for which he is being sued. The argument between the plaintiff and the union is even further removed from those which the Labour Relations Board has exclusive jurisdiction. The dispute is, in its essential character, contractual in nature; namely, is the plaintiff entitled to the benefits of an indemnity clause in the Union by-laws? 4) The dispute widens to an internecine dispute in a voluntary sports organization respecting the disciplining of high school coach over recruiting practices. In short, this is precisely the type of internal dispute that is not within the exclusive realm of the LRB. 5) The forum for this contest is The Queen’s Bench Court.

The accused had not had the benefit of a preliminary inquiry as a result of the Crown preferring the indictment against him. There was no evidence before the Court on the merits of the case as the trial had yet to begin. The defence argued that because the case had been so closely related to other incidents that it was impossible for the accused to get a fair trial by an impartial jury. HELD: The application for a stayed of proceedings was dismissed. 1)The pre- trial publicity, filled as it was with prejudicial and inflammatory information, had not prejudiced the accused's right to be tried by a fair jury of his peers. 2)The applicant had not established on a balance of probabilities that his right to a free and fair jury trial had been violated. 3)The application for an injunction restraining the execution of the application was made on the basis of prejudicial comments and images in the media. 4)The Court was satisfied that there was an apprehension of bias such that it would reasonably be expected to affect a potential juror's impartiality. However, until it is known to what extent this information has affected the potential jurors, the issue remained speculative. 5)It was not possible to determine whether the accused had been prejudiced because of all the negative publicity. 6)The court was also required to consider whether there had been an adverse effect on the general populous climate of fear which made the selection of a jury impossible."

Having regard for the fact that the accused have been in custody for nearly 10 months, the Court gives them two for one credit for time served in remand which is 20 months. The sentence is 2 years to be served in a federal penitentiary.

The fire alarm system was not functioning and, despite being aware of previous problems with the 25-year-old system, the defendant had never maintained or inspected it; the self-closing hallway fire doors were continually in an open position; the battery-operated fire alarm in the plaintiffs' apartment was not functioning; and the plaintiffs were unaware of whether their smoke detector was wired into the building or was their responsibility. The male plaintiff suffered serious fractures to both ankles and a fractured fibula. He underwent four surgeries, was non-weight bearing for three months and was unable to run or engage in various sports. Although he had returned to work as a production worker, his condition would continue to deteriorate due to post-traumatic arthritis, most likely resulting in a future ankle fusion. The female plaintiff suffered a pelvic ring injury with bilateral pelvic and sacral fractures, a fractured elbow and a broken rib. She underwent surgery on her pelvis, was unable to look after her own hygiene for five months and developed bursitis in the hip. She continued to experience pain in the tailbone with extensive sitting and in the elbow with extension of the arm, had a permanent loss of elbow extension and walked with a limp. The worsening of her pre-existing anxiety and depression led to the diagnosis of post-traumatic stress disorder. The landlord argued that the plaintiffs' injuries had not been caused by any of its actions. Male plaintiff awarded the sum of $75,000 for general damages, $15,000 for past and future loss of valuable services and $45,000 for loss of earning capacity; female plaintiff awarded the sum of $55,000 for general damages, $35,000 for past and future loss of valuable services and $75,000 for future loss of income. Although there was no evidence that the defendant was responsible for the fire, its conduct created an unreasonable risk of harm in the event of a fire. Without evidence as to how much time the plaintiffs would have had to escape down the stairwell or how long they would have had to wait for the fire department had the smoke or fire alarms activated, the 'material contribution' test was applied to the causation issue. When the plaintiffs first awoke, the fire had already worked its way up through the attic hatch to the roof, where the flames in the eaves were visible to the plaintiffs. Smoke and fire were able to flow freely through the adjacent stairwell as a result of the fire door being left open, and the failure of the smoke detectors and fire alarms allowed the smoke and fire to progress before being detected by the plaintiffs. The female plaintiff was found to have no meaningful residual earning capacity due to the combination of her physical and psychological injuries.","The plaintiff and her partner were in an apartment building when they jumped from the top floor of a building. The building was essentially a wooden structure with vinyl siding on exterior walls and asphalt roof shingles. The ceiling was completely black with smoke and flames. The plaintiff suffered serious injuries from the fall. The fire alarm system in the building was not working at the time of the fire. The smoke detector in the plaintiff's apartment was not functioning properly. There were problems with the fire alarm systems not functioning prior to the fire which was known to the defendant's supervisor; the defendant did not maintain, test, inspect or inspect its fire engine system that was in excess of 25 years old; there were no beeping noises coming from the smoke alarm system. Although there was no evidence the defendant was responsible for the fire, the defendant breached the standard of care owed to the plaintiffs by failing to ensure they were reasonably safe from injury while residing in the premises. Liability and damages were at issue in this case. The common law duty of care arises from the proximity of the relationship between a landlord and the tenants of its multi-unit residential building. In this case, the defendants owed a duty of caring to the plaintiff to ensure their were reasonably secure from injury by residing in their premises. This would include the installation and maintenance of an operational fire system. The defendant was also subject to statutory obligations. The residential Tenancies Act sets out statutory conditions that apply to all residential leases including the requirement to keep the premises in good state of repair and to comply with any statutes regarding safety. The National Fire Code required the installation of an 'operating fire alarm' system which must be tested yearly. Also, yearly testing of the smoke alarms was required. In the circumstances the plaintiff was injured, the damages would have been incurred on a balance of probabilities."
6_1997canlii9949.txt,The applicant sought an order requesting an absolute order of discharge in bankruptcy. The bankrupt was indebted to Canada Student Loans and Saskatchewan Student Loans. He had obtained a Bachelor of Science degree but was unable to complete his final year of Veterinary Medicine because he had received the maximum amount of financing available. The bankrupt had been employed for 5 years as a taxi driver earning a less than average income; he lived at home with his parents; he was single with no dependents. He was reluctant to leave secure employment in an effort to obtain employment related to his educational qualifications. Counsel for the objecting creditor argued that the bankrupt had a minimal income and had the capacity to make small payments toward his obligation. HELD: An absolute order of discharge was granted in accordance with the principles of The Bankruptcy and Insolvency Act.,"The bankrupt obtained a Bachelor of Science degree in Chemistry and an Advanced Certificate in Science-Physio as a result of student loan funding. He was indebted to Canada Student Loans in the amount of $22,338.99 and Saskatchewan student loans in the amounts of $18,241.39. The Saskatchewan program objected to the automatic discharge of the bankrupt. HELD: After carefully considering the submissions and bearing in mind the objects and principles of the Bankruptcy and Insolvency Act, an absolute order of discharge is appropriate. 1)While am not impressed with the bankrupt's attitude, it would be futile to impose a conditional order of discharged in this situation due to his low income. The bankrupt is obviously very intelligent and capable individual. sincerely hope that he finds a way to complete his degree in veterinary medicine at some point in the future. 2)The bankrupt is just shy of his 30th birthday. He is living at home and he is paying very reasonable rent and food expenses are very reasonable (he is single with no dependents). The net income is modest and well below the superintendents guideline for a single person. The trustee, on the other hand, recommends an absolute discharge."
2_2005skpc39.txt,"The accused is charged with driving while over .08 contrary to s. 255(1) and s. 253(a) of the Criminal Code and impaired driving contrary to s. s. 253(b) and 255(1) of the Code. HELD: The accused is not guilty on all counts.  1) A breath test and demand should be made as soon as the officer forms the requisite grounds for making it. Those grounds did not change between the time the accused refused to provide an ASD sample at 8:17 a.m., when the officer arrested her for impaired driving and 8:40 a.m. when the officer read the accused the breathalyzer demand. There was no reason for the breath demand not being made forthwith. The rights of the accused under s. 8 and s. 9 of the Charter were breached. 2) The officer did not have reasonable and probable grounds for making the breathalyzer demand. The officer testified she gave the ASD demand to find out if the accused had alcohol in her system. When the accused refused, the officer arrested her for impaired driving. The officer was unsure of whether the accused had alcohol in her system when she read the accused the ASD demand and there was no new evidence gathered between 8:17 a.m. and 8:40 a.m. to justify the breath demand. The evidence does not support a subjective honest belief on the part of the officer that the ability of the accused to operate a motor vehicle was impaired by alcohol. As the breath sample evidence was obtained as a consequence of the breach of the s. 8 and s. 9 Charter rights of the accused, it should be excluded from evidence pursuant to s. 24(2).  3) The accused testified that she had been drinking alcohol and was feeling the effects of the alcohol at the time she was operating the vehicle. She said she knew the alcohol would kick in and that she was not really feeling the effects until she arrived at the police station. She offered an explanation for her difficulty in driving testifying that she was tired. The evidence of the officer, which was insufficient to support a belief of impairment as a prerequisite to a breath demand, cannot prove impaired driving. There is insufficient evidence to conclude beyond a reasonable doubt that the accused's ability to drive was impaired by alcohol at the time she was driving.","The accused was charged with being at large on her undertakings given to Justice or Judge and being bound to comply with conditions including that she abstain from all use, consumption and possession of alcohol and that she not be impaired by alcohol at the time she was operating the vehicle. The accused testified that she knew the alcohol would kick in and she was not really feeling the effects until she arrived at the police station. HELD: The accused was found not guilty of both counts. The certificate of analysis was not admissible because the breathalyzer demand was not made forthwith or as soon as practicable. The officer did not have reasonable and probable grounds for making the demand. The evidence of the officer was insufficient to support a belief of impairment as prerequisite to a breath demand, cannot alone prove impaired driving beyond a reasonable doubt. The driving evidence together with red eyes and slurred speech is not enough to prove impaired ability to operate a motor vehicle."
2_2009skpc71.txt,"Mr. Kenny is charged under The Wildlife Act Regulations, 1981 with use of a searchlight when hunting. Specifically, the section reads: 11.1(2) For the purpose of ensuring the safety of hunters and the public, a searchlight shall not be used for the purposes of hunting wildlife. The case was decided on the basis of credibility. The Court reviewed the requirements for assessing credibility and found it did not believe the accused. The Court stated that, on all the evidence, it was convinced beyond a reasonable doubt that the accused was using a searchlight for the purpose of hunting wildlife. HELD: The accused is guilty as charged.","HELD: The Court did not believe the evidence of the defendant and acquitted him. On all of the evidence, I am convinced of his guilt beyond reasonable doubt. The Crown has the burden throughout the case to prove the constituent elements of the offence beyond a reasonable doubt with credible evidence. The Court cannot accept the explanation offered by the defendant that he was looking for a moose caller when he was driving through the forest. All of the indicia of hunting at night with the use of a searchlight are present in this case. It cannot escape notice that there were two loaded firearms in the vehicle; cannot accept that the rifle that was in the back seat of the truck was loaded with 30-30 rifles, one of which had one live round in the chamber, four live rounds in the magazine, and 14 rounds of ammunition were compatible with the two rifles that were seized. There are some uncontroverted facts, all of which are consistent only with an inescapable inference that the defendant was employing the searchlight for the purposes of hunting wildlife."
b_1999skqb39.txt,HELD: The grandparents were granted access one Saturday every second month from 10:00 a.m. to 4:00 p.m. It would be in the best interests of the child to have some ongoing relationship with both his maternal and paternal grandparents. The father lived in Alberta and may not be able to exercise the degree of access he was seeking. The relationships were separate with unique characteristics.,"The paternal grandparents sought an order granting them access to their grandson, R.D.G., born December 1995, pursuant to s. 6.1(1) of the Children's Law Act, 1997. The applicant paternal grandparents opposed the access and suggested that any access being exercised by the applicants should be exercised during the access periods granted to their son, P.J.B. HELD: The paternal grandparents were to be granted access one Saturday every two months. The access period was to be less frequent than that which would be granted to the child's father. The Court was of the view that it would be in the best interests of the child to have some ongoing relationship with both his maternal grandparents and his paternal grandparents."
3_2005nssc122.txt,"The 23 year old defendant pled guilty to two counts of breaking and entering a dwelling house and one count of breaking and entering a shed. He cooperated with the police and provided evidence against his co-accused. He had a previous criminal record, which included convictions for mischief, theft, break and enter, breach of an undertaking and possession of stolen goods. Defendant sentenced to four years imprisonment; in assessing the appropriate sentence, the court allowed a credit for time already served (which was served virtually throughout in protective custody), a credit of 25% for the fact that the defendant had pled guilty and a further reduction of one and a half years for the defendant's assistance in pursuing the successful prosecution of his co-accused.","The accused, who had previously entered guilty pleas to eight counts contained in an indictment, was charged with aggravated assault, being a party to unlawfully causing bodily harm and being in possession of a weapon which had been stolen from two residences. The accused also entered into plea agreements with the co-accused and the defence. The sentencing judge found that the accused had a less than perfect upbringing as a child and had a fair amount of instability in his years of life. The pre-sentence report prepared by the Crown recommended a sentence of four years to a maximum of five years, as well as a 10 year prohibition from the possession of weapons. The Crown sought a period of six years incarceration, as opposed to the 10 years already imposed for breaking and entering. The defence sought to rationalize the range of sentences imposed for home invasions, arguing that the sentencing judge failed to take into account the aggravating circumstances of the accused's previous offences, particularly his failure to alert the appropriate parties to obtain assistance for the victim. HELD: The appropriate sentence was for the home invasion, having regard to all of the factors that go into the calculation of the sentence: four years for the offence of break and enter under s. 348.1(b) of the Code, a life imprisonment sentence for common assault, a two-year prohibition from possessing a weapon for the same purpose, and 10 years for common break and enters. The sentences imposed were based on the factors set out in the Code that the Crown had reviewed prior to making the determinations in the case of this case. The evidence was extensive, the accused readily admitted his culpability and co-operated fully with the police, including testifying at the trial of the other accused and the defendant was found guilty of a similar count in relation to similar offences committed in the same area. There was no evidence to support the Crown's argument that the evidence was unreliable and the accused should be given credit for time already served."
7_2007skqb28.txt,"The respondent was charged with impaired driving contrary to s. 253(a) of the Criminal Code and driving while over .08, contrary to s. 253(b) of the Code. The Crown appeals the acquittal on the charge under s. 253(b) of the Code. At trial the Crown argued that, prior to searching the vehicle and having close contact with the accused in the police car, the RCMP officer did not have a reasonable suspicion that he had alcohol in his body and therefore did not make a screening device demand immediately. On appeal the Crown submits that the trial judge accepted this and therefore there was no unlawful detention and the lapse of 17 minutes from the time he was placed in the back of the police vehicle until a demand was made. The Crown submits that the trial judge was in error in concluding that the 17 minute delay was not warranted or necessary and that there was no breach of the accused's right to be free of arbitrary detention within the meaning of s. 9 of the Charter. HELD: The appeal is dismissed. It appears that the officer may have been anxious to search the vehicle in anticipation that more than just a charge of impaired driving could be supported. Had he proceeded with a quick search of the vehicle and then proceeded with the demand in a short time period that may have been a reasonable violation of the accused's Charter rights. It is obvious from the evidence that in the course of searching the vehicle, the police officer returned to the police vehicle where the accused was detained and he had a further conversation with him, following which he returned to continue his search of the vehicle. In the circumstances, the delay of 17 minutes from when the police officer should have made the demand but did not and detained the accused in the locked police vehicle while he conducted a search of the accused's vehicle without arresting him, advising him of his rights and conducting a search of his vehicle is a violation of potentially three separate Charter rights. The evidence of the subsequent breathalyzer and certificate of analysis is conscriptive evidence obtained following the breach of the accused's Charter rights and the trial judge properly ruled that pursuant to s. 24(2) of the Charter the evidence should be excluded and the charge dismissed.","HELD: The appeal was dismissed. The court found that the delay between the time the respondent was stopped and when the roadside screening demand was made took the demand outside of the 'forthwith' requirement of s. 254(2) of the Criminal Code. The delay of 17 minutes from the time that the police officer first observed the open bottle of alcohol in the vehicle to the complainant was not reasonable and practical. The respondent was detained because he was locked in the police vehicle and he could not exit. During the 17 minutes between the stop and the roadside demand, the officer noted an odour of alcohol from the accused and made a demand which resulted in a 'fail' reading. The accused was taken to Carlyle detachment where he provided two samples of breath, both readings being 120 mgs. In the instant case, it appears that the officer may have been anxious to search the vehicle in anticipation that more than a just charge of impaired driving could be supported. Had he proceeded with a quick search of the vehicle and then proceeded with the demand in a short period of time, that might have been a reasonable violation of the accused's Charter rights. However, what the officer chose to do was have the respondent wait in the car while he conducted a search of his vehicle because the search was being conducted at the side of the road. This caused a delay of approximately 17 minutes and the accused was given no right to counsel."
2_2008nssm16.txt,"The claimant purchaser brought an action for breach of contract and negligent misrepresentation, claiming that although the defendant vendors had advised her that there had been some damage to the chimney base in the residence, she had been told that this was a minor problem which was under repair and she had not been properly advised of a history of repeated flooding.  Following the purchase of the property, the claimant had commenced renovations and discovered extensive mould or rot throughout the basement, to such an extent that the entire basement had to be gutted, disinfected and rebuilt. She also claimed that a buried cistern was discovered in the backyard, which had been partly filled with earth but still filled up with rainwater and melted snow, and that the water had nowhere else to go but against the foundation. When the defendants brought a motion for non-suit at the conclusion of her case, the unrepresented claimant expressed surprise and dismay that her case could be dismissed before both sides had testified as she expected her remaining evidence to come out through the defendants' testimony. Motion granted; the claim against the defendants is dismissed; it is the responsibility of the buyer to verify the accuracy of the Property Condition Disclosure Statement (PCDS) and, in this case, the claimant had made no inquiry as to the statements made by the defendants of structural problems or unrepaired damage or leakage in the foundation. The claimant had notification, both in the PCDS and from her home inspector, that there were leakage problems in the basement and the inspection report had advised her of the need to make further enquiries. There was no evidence the latent defects (the cracks in the wall, the mould and the rotten wood) were visible to the defendants when they occupied the home, that there was continual leakage of which the defendants were aware or that the defendants had performed any repairs to the home during their occupancy to cover up the wood rot. Although there was evidence that the defendants were aware of the cistern and had not disclosed this to the claimant, there was no evidence to conclude that the cistern was causing the problem.","The claimant claimed damages for a house sale because the disclosure statement did not disclose a history of repeated flooding. The claimant alleged that the home had flooded 12 years ago. Later the Defendants moved back in and the neighbours burned out their shop vac cleaning up water in the basement. When the baseboards were removed, mould was on two different walls neither of which was the furnace room nor the exercise room. There were watermarks coming down the cement wall below the windows. The parties were required to carefully examine the property and have it inspected by an independent party or parties to verify the above information. At issue was whether the claimant's claim was sufficiently advanced to warrant a non-suit. HELD: The claim was dismissed. The court held that it was necessary to allow the parties to present all the facts that can be proven in a court of law manner. It was not the function of the decision maker to tell the litigants who they should call as witness or whether they should provide evidence of their knowledge of the present state of the property. The decision was made with respect to the sufficiency of the evidence and the credibility of the witnesses. 1)The court reviewed the law on motions for non-suits and found that most of the time it is not necessary to decide whether a claim is sufficiently advanced or too advanced for a court to impose its own warranties. 2)There was a fine balance between an adversarial process and an inquisitional process that raises itself often in Small Claims Court proceedings. 3)The decision to dismiss the motion was not made to lessen the court's ability to make a case for the claim. The common person is not operating on a level playing field when facing an opposing counsel with vast experience and law degree. Many of us have no experience with the courts because we have abided by the law. It is not the common person's responsibility to impose a sufficiency test in the circumstances of a case such as this one. The test is whether there was insufficient evidence, if believed, to satisfy a reasonable person that the case could be resolved in the appellant's favour. 4)The doctrine of merger has been softened considerably in the sale of goods due to legislative intrusion but that has yet to take place with the sales of real property and it should not be up to the Court to impose such a test."
e_1999canlii6888.txt,"The plaintiffs sued based on a contract between the parties that required the defendant to share the proceeds of milk quota sales. The defendant took the position that the contract only required the sharing of fluid milk quota sales, and not all milk quota sales. The plaintiff sought rectification of the contract to change the wording of the contract to milk quota sales from fluid milk quota sales. Finding for the plaintiff and granting rectification, that the parties clearly intended to have the contract cover all milk quota sales. The proceeds from all sales are to be divided between the parties.","The plaintiffs sought rectification of the agreement terms in regard to the sharing by all three of them in the proceeds from any sales of milk quota by Lorne Putnam's company. The three brothers each formed a new company at that time with Gene owning the dairy farm and Merle owning the trailer park and gravel pit operation. The plan was to incorporate new company called 'Geneco.' Gene Putnam died in 1982 and after his death his company changed over to a single quota system known as Total Production Quota (TPQ). Therefore any sales after that date were under the new quota scheme. The plaintiff argued that the agreement only refers to the Fluid Milk Quota and therefore it was obligated to only share proceeds from the sale of the sold version of the quota and not all quota sold. The defendant agreed to split the proceeds three ways. First, it was agreed that all three brothers would get a share of the sale proceeds. The second, the agreement was not binding on any of the plaintiffs. The third, and the most important issue was the sharing of proceeds from a sale of only one quota. The plaintiffs sought to have the agreement interpreted as meaning that the three brothers and their company were obligated to share proceeds only from sales of only the one quota sold and that all other quota sold should be retained by the actual milk producer. The parties agreed that the quota would be transferred to the new company and that if the quota was disposed of prior to 2003 it would be shared equally among the brothers. The agreement was based on the terms of the previous agreement which clearly indicated that they and their father had agreed that they would have joint ownership of all the milk quota owned by the company and the Market Share Quota. The fourth, and perhaps the most significant issue, was the possibility of a tax consequences resulting from the reorganization of the parent company. Granting the plaintiffs the costs of interpreting the agreement, that the plaintiffs were entitled to a share in any sale of any quota sold, regardless of whether the quota is changed or not."
e_2005skqb263.txt,"Accused is charged with second degree murder in the death of his estranged wife. The Crown sought to admit into evidence a number of statements that were made by the deceased to several crown witnesses concerning two previous incidents she had with the accused in the weeks prior to her death. In the first incident, the accused is alleged to have choked the victim after he confronted her about where she had been. In the second incident the accused confronted the victim and beat and choked her and then sexually assaulted and threatened to kill her. The Crown seeks to admit this similar fact evidence and several hearsay statements to prove the issues of motive, intent and modus operandi. HELD: The statements by the deceased are not admissible. The prejudicial nature of the similar fact evidence has not been overcome by its probative value. It is well established law that similar acts and other discreditable conduct evidence is presumptively inadmissible and that similar fact evidence is the exception to this. To determine its admissibility, three things need examination, 1) the probative weight of the evidence, 2) the assessment of the prejudice and 3) the weighing of the probative value versus prejudicial value. In examining the probative weight of the evidence, factors to be considered include the issues in question, the presence or absence of collusion, similarities and dissimilarities between the facts charged and the similar fact evidence and the strength of the evidence that the events occurred. The two previous incidents are extremely prejudicial in nature leading to potential moral prejudice. That is, reprehensible nature of the assaults could lead the jury to rely on the prohibited inference that the accused is the type of person who could have committed the crime. There is also a great risk of reasoning prejudice. That is, admitting the similar fact evidence may distract the jury from their proper focus which is the second degree murder charge. There is a possibility that the jury will equate the intention to harm with the mens rea required for a murder conviction. With respect to the hearsay evidence, the Court held that statements made by the deceased to her friends, family and colleagues concerning the threats and assaults will not be admitted. The test of necessity is clearly met by the fact that the person making the statements in now deceased and not able to testify. However, the Court was concerned about the reliability of the statements since there is nothing that would serve as convincing indicia of reliability adequate to offset the absence of an oath.","The Crown sought to admit the two previous incidents of choking as similar fact evidence to prove issues of motive, intent and modus operandi. The accused was charged with assault causing bodily harm and sexual assault contrary to s. 235. HELD: 1) The Court held there must, at least, be some evidence capable of reasonably supporting finding that the appellant was implicated in the other similar acts. 2) The evidence was found to be admissible on a principled basis with respect to the admissibility of the first two incidents as well as the hearsay statements made by the accused to her friends, family and co-workers. There was a risk that the evidence would distract members of the jury from their proper focus which is the second degree murder charge, which requires proof beyond a reasonable doubt that the accused committed the actus reus and has the requisite procedural safeguards to ensure threshold reliability. Similar fact evidence is presumptively inadmissible and it should not be admitted in order to ensure the possibility of a fair trial."

Application dismissed; a judge of the Court of Appeal in Chambers does not have the authority to make the order requested; in any event, an application in the Family Division for leave to terminate the permanent care order would be a more appropriate way for the applicant to proceed.","The paternal grandmother applied in Chambers for an order that she be added as a party so that she can appeal a permanent care order respecting her granddaughter. The paternal grandmother was the subject of protection proceedings brought by the Children's Aid Society in the Family Division. The Family Division placed the child in the permanent care and custody of the Children’s Aid Society of Halifax. The grandmother found out about the order after the fact, and found out that the Society had wrongly shut her out of the process and that the judge in the family division erred in not considering family placement with her before the order was made. The applicant sought to add a party for the purposes of bringing an appeal. HELD: The application was dismissed. The Chambers judge does not have the authority to make the order sought. The authority of the Chambers judge depends on an express or implied grant of power in a rule or enactment and should not be interpreted as conferring jurisdiction. There are a number of issues of fact which the Court would not make an order as, in its opinion, an application to the Family Court for leave to terminate the permanently care order appears likely to be a more appropriate initial way for the applicant to proceed. Nothing which have been said in the material filed would persuade the Court to dismiss the application."

There was no application to set aside any of the garnishee summons' by the Defendant and he did not appear on this application. HELD: Application allowed. 1)The court has an inherent power to control its own process in garnishment proceedings. 2)The court also has the discretion to order the payment of the money to the plaintiff as a judgment creditor. 3)The chambers judge ordered that the monies held in court to the credit of this cause be paid to the plaintiff, but made no order as to costs.","The applicant applied for an order pursuant to s. 14 of The Attachment of Debts Act to pay out to her certain monies paid into court by the Royal Bank of Canada and by Martindale Holdings Ltd. plus the interest thereon plus the respondent's judgment. Sokulski was personally served with notice of this application but did not appear. The applicant obtained judgment against the respondent May 11, 1987 in the Court of Queen's Bench for Alberta in the sum of $11,634.74. The respondent was served with the garnishee summons twice. The judgment was registered as judgment for Saskatchewan July 7, 1987. The amount paid out by both garnishees was $383.71. Interest accrued to the plaintiff was not accrued. The chambers judge erred by freezing the money already paid into Court under the invalid garnisihee summons pending resolution of the trial of the action. HELD: The plaintiff was directed to pay the monies out of court to the defendants.  1)The chambers judge did not make any errors in law.  2)The plaintiff succeeded at trial and recovered judgment from which an appeal has now been dismissed today. If the defendants had brought this garnishment appeal forward, the court would have resisted the order to make payment available to them. However, the Chamber judge did make a proper error in making the payment available in the first instance.  3)There were a number of deficiencies in the procedure adopted.

Awarding the plaintiff one-third of her taxed costs, that to reduce costs by the percentage of fault of the plaintiff and to reduce the amount involved would be a double reduction.","The plaintiff was found two-thirds responsible for the injuries suffered when the defendant's vehicle struck her while she was attempting to cross the No. Highway. Damage was determined at $1,255.25. The defendant agreed to apportion costs in the amount of $50,000 to the plaintiff on a Tariff A scale and fixed the amount at $25,000.00. The plaintiff filed an Offer to Settle in 1993 and the trial was held two years later. The Defendant then withdrew the counterclaim. The Court concluded that double recovery results from the accident and that the appropriate rate of interest to be applied is 2.5%. This practice was followed by the Appeal Division in cases where the findings of fault relate to the happening of the event causing the accident rather than to any aggravation of the injuries or failure to mitigate their effect. In this case, the Court found that a double recovery resulted."
3_1998canlii1477.txt,"The plaintiff was subcontracted by the City of Dartmouth to build a sports field. The defendant were the project consultants for the City, and were involved throughout the tendering process and construction. Their report indicated a number of significant potential problems. The plaintiff was not made aware of the report when it bid on the project. The plaintiff subsequently became aware of the problems, which made their work more costly. After completing the work, it commenced a claim for the additional work which had to be performed due to the undisclosed site conditions. The defendants were joined by the City as a third party to that action. The plaintiff was successful at trial, but the decision was overturned on appeal. The plaintiff then commenced the present action directly against the defendant, alleging negligent misrepresentation. The defendant applied to strike the action on the basis of res judicata and abuse of process. Granting the application, that the present cause of action is the same one litigated in the first action, simply under a different legal concept. To allow the plaintiff to relitigate the same action on the same factual basis would be an abuse of process.","The plaintiff obtained a subcontract to perform most of the work on a recreational park and sports field for the City of Dartmouth. The consultants for the city had been involved in a previously planned international calibre soccer field which had been abandoned by the city and instead proceeded with some playing fields. Turf Masters bid on and obtained the subcontract without being aware of the two consultants' reports regarding site problems as these were not included or otherwise disclosed during the tendering and contract process. Shortly after commencing the work, the City and the plaintiff commenced an action against the city, alleging negligent misrepresentation and breach of standard of care, and claiming indemnity and negligent misrepresentations. The plaintiff commenced a second action in which it claimed the city's negligence had been decided by a combination of the trial judge's and the Court of Appeal's decisions in the first action and the trial of the second action. In this action, the plaintiff requested certain paragraphs of the defendant's defence be struck out pursuant to Civil Procedure Rule 14.25 on the basis of res judicata and abuse of process. The second application was also dismissed. HELD: The Court granted the application and dismissed the second application. 1)The doctrine of 'issue estoppel' applied to both applications. While it is not technically necessary to decide this matter, the Court could say that it would have no hesitation in deciding the matter itself. 2)On the issue of the 'first action' it is clear that the defendant should have raised the point now asserted in the plaintiff's first action (quantum meruit) based on the non-disclosure of the soil reports. It appears to have been well aware that the factual basis for the present allegation was not litigated in the original fashion. It is common ground that the two site evaluation reports prepared by the defendant were not provided to the plaintiff prior to the bidding, obtaining and entering into into the contract. The City had abandoned the idea of an international caliber soccer field after concluding it could not afford such a field. The increased potential damage pool as a result of the application did not constitute new facts which could not have been discovered with reasonable diligence. 3)Costs of the first and second application were awarded to both parties."
d_1997canlii10919.txt,"FIAT. Interim custody of two of the children was awarded to the respondent in January 1997. The eldest resided with her mother. Decisions on child and spousal maintenance, including costs of access and counselling had been reserved. HELD: 1)The respondent was to pay interim maintenance of $388 per month for the child residing with the mother and $350 per month for interim spousal maintenance. Under the guidelines he would be required to pay $1,165 per month for three children at an income level of $38,000. No abatement was made in view of the petitioner's modest income. 2)The respondent was to assume costs of twice monthly access by the petitioner and counselling costs. 3)The petitioner was to keep the respondent informed of her employment status and revenue. 4)Interim custody and access was to be reviewed July 4/97 if the parties had not settled the matter.","FIAT. The court reserved a decision on the questions of child and spousal maintenance including costs of access and counselling. It was common ground that the respondent's 1996 income included the following: employment 22,950 Unemployment insurance benefits 5,197.00 Town councillor's indemnity 700.00 Total $28,847.00 The petitioner's position was rosy. She was in receipt of unemployment insurance benefits $318 every two weeks plus whatever casual work she could obtain. Her employment was sporadic and it was difficult to determine her level of income for the purpose of her application for maintenance. An attribution of income of $800 per month is fair for the current determination of maintenance. If there is a significant change in her income level an application to vary may be brought by the respondent. The respondent is supporting the oldest child, Brianna, who resides with his mother in Regina and accordingly the petitioner must support her. In terms of child support, at an income level of $38,000 the respondent should pay $1,165 per month for three children or $388 per month per child. Given the petitioner's modest revenue, it is reasonable to expect he should pay thatamount without any abatement of her income."

The defendant was not satisfied with the plaintiff's work, hired a third party to fix the plaintiff's work and refused to pay the plaintiff. The plaintiff sued for payment of the outstanding account HELD: The plaintiff's claim is dismissed. The Court found enough evidence to conclude that the central purpose of the contract for installation was not achieved and that there was a breach of the implied condition that it would be performed in a workmanlike standard. As the plaintiff's workmanship constitutes a breach of contract, the defendant's damages are set off against the claim.","HELD: The action was set down for summary trial with no examinations for discovery or pre-trial conference. The plaintiff was entitled to damages. The issue before me was whether the court was liable to pay the defendant's outstanding account. The court found that the plaintiff's workmanship was not achieved and that, therefore, there had been a breach of the implied condition of the contract that it would be performed in a'manlike manner'. The court ordered that the procedure at trial would be the procedure for simplified trial as set out in Saskatchewan, Court of Queen's Bench Rules, rule 494."
d_1991canlii2552.txt,"The appellant, which was a wholly owned subsidiary of a major international company, induced the respondent to enter a franchise agreement by making representations as to the viability of the venture. The appellant sought to recover its losses from the respondent and relied on an exclusionary clause. Allowing the appeal in part, that (1) the agreement was unconscionable, having regard to the unequal bargaining power of the parties, the fact that the agreement was prepared by the appellant, and the fact that the appellant induced the respondent with its promotional brochure and its verbal representations as to the venture's viability to enter the franchise agreement; (2) the appellant cannot rely on an exclusionary clause given its unconscionable conduct; and (3) the appellant's claim for the value of the inventory together with pre-judgment interest was payable by the respondent. In a dissenting opinion, it was held that neither the appellant's conduct nor the franchise agreement was unconscionable; rather the respondent was an experienced businessman and the representations as to the venture's viability were mere projections, which he should have realized were unreliable.","The appellant was a wholly owned subsidiary of Imperial Oil involved in the distribution and sale of automotive parts and related products. Prior to 1985 that activity, exclusively wholesale, was achieved through a nation wide network of outlets leased from the appellant and operated by agents on a commission basis. In 1986 the appellant carried out an intensive and extensive assessment of its total operations with the view to changing its manner of conducting business by way of an agency to offering franchise to business people. That company could not be considered an existing jobber business. The trial judge held that the clause did not foreclose the respondents' right to rely upon the breach of a warranty. Dismissing the appeal, that the trial judge made certain findings of fact, which affected the appellant's assessment of the facts. The appellant was forced into the position that it had no intention of applying the provisions of s. 4.02 and s. 6.01. With hindsight, the appellant cannot contend that Ritchie's forecast was relieved because of the existence of Yarmouth Equipment. The franchise agreement contained an exclusionary clause which prevented the appellant from disclosing information to the respondent about the potential profitability of the franchise."

The closing date will only be postponed if the parties cannot agree on an issue of costs. Application dismissed. In this case, the contract was not completed but terminated upon the date for closing without extension. The applicant's application was not made during the pendency of the contract.

Yellow Quill First Nation applied for intervenor status. The trial judge found, without giving reasons, that the project was a development as defined in the Environmental Assessment Act and the application for mandamus was adjourned sine die. HELD: The appeal was granted and the order set aside without costs. 1)The proposal was not a development as defined in s 2(d) of the EAA. The Department of Agriculture, the Department of the Environment and Resource Management were of the opinion that the KSS project was not a development as defined in the Act as it did not come within any of the criteria listed in s2(d). 2)The Environmental Assessment Branch was of the opinion that no significant impacts on the environment would occur or if they do, mitigation measures would be implemented to reduce or eliminate the potential for significant environmental impact.  3)It was not necessary to decide whether Yellow Quill or the respondents had standing to privately enforce a public right. 4)In light of the decision the following were not in issue: whether the respondent should have applied by way of judicial review in the nature of certiorari; the relationship between the Environmental Assessment and Agricultural Operations Act; and whether a proponent of an intensive livestock operation can be required to make an application under the Agricultural Operations Act and to carry out an environmental impact assessment under s9 of the EAA.","The respondents applied to the Court of Queen's Bench by notice of motion for a declaration that the intensive livestock operation being constructed by the Kelvington Super Swine Inc.

The application was deferred to permit the Court to deal with the substance of the matters raised by the parties already before the Court. HELD: The appeal was granted with costs to the respondents. 1) The majority of the facts deposed to in the affidavits filed on behalf of the respondents are based on information and belief. While there has been some public concern expressed about the possible environmental effect of new technology that is concerned with resource utilization and that may induce significant environmental change, that concern is not wide-spread. 2) The affidavit evidence filed by the respondents is based on conjecture, speculation and hearsay with no basis in fact. The portions may not be considered. 3) The chambers judge erred in law in granting the appellant standing for the private enforcement of a public right and in failing to do so, disallows the affidavit evidence to such a extent that it becomes a disservice to the public. 4) The Court found that the proposal was not a development as defined in s.2(d).

He was seeking damages against the federal government for alleged abuses suffered while attending an Indian Residential School. The mother sought to attach the possible damage award for child support. HELD: The first $50,000 of any settlement proceeds, after payment of reasonable solicitor fees and disbursements, shall be paid into Court by his counsel. The Court agreed with the conclusion in Anderson that an order can be made with respect to damage awards even though, at the moment of the order, there is only a cause of action in existence and no precise amount of damages are known. There was no question that a cause of action or chose in action is property and thus the subject of an order under the Family Maintenance Act s.8. It is of no consequence that the order may be in another form such as money. To adopt any different analysis would be to unnecessarily limit the remedial application of s.8. Given the overarching purpose to ensure property is not wasted, thus impairing or defeating a claim under the FMA, it was logical orders can be made by the Court that are ancillary or a natural incident of the primary order preserving the property.

The settlement proceeds into Court in accordance with the terms of the order. It is not offensive to direct the applicant's counsel, at the time of such settlement, if there is a settlement, pay monies into Court.

9_2006nssc379.txt,"The Minister sought numerous orders for production of medical and various other files (including the mother's complete medical files from her family physician, the Nova Scotia Hospital and another hospital, and her files from a woman's shelter and an addiction treatment and prevention service) in an ongoing child protection proceeding. The mother argued that the records sought were irrelevant and that if there was any relevance, they were privileged, were unnecessary to the fair disposition of the proceeding, and their production would not save costs and would be injurious to the public interest. The addiction prevention and treatment service, Nova Scotia Hospital and mental health clinic records and files are ordered to be produced; the medical records of the family physician, the hospital and the woman's shelter are not ordered to be produced as these files would contain some irrelevant information and the relevant information could be obtained by other means. In a child protection proceeding, documents may be relevant to prove a protection finding, to monitor compliance with existing orders, or to develop and evaluate a plan of care. Records held by individuals or organizations to whom an individual has been referred as a result of a child protection proceeding are not privileged as no confidentiality could be expected in those circumstances. Records held by individuals or organizations whose services were accessed independent of a court order or the Minister's involvement that would ordinarily attract privilege may be ordered to be produced in child protection proceedings. However, if the information contained in the records can be obtained by a means targeted specifically to produce the relevant information, then orders for production for all of the records will not be necessary to the fair disposition of the proceeding. Also, since such records contain irrelevant, as well as relevant material, such an order would violate the privacy protections found in the Charter and be injurious to the public interest.","The applicant sought 13 Orders of Production for documents prepared by and in the possession of her service providers. The Minister was requesting the records as part of a protection proceeding. The applicant argued that this threshold was inappropriate for proceedings commenced pursuant to the Children and Family Services Act. This threshold was established for civil proceedings in which the records sought are often well-defined and generally narrow in scope. This information is relevant to the preparation of the parental capacity assessment. Although the applicant did not deny the factual information provided in the Minister's supporting affidavit, she should have provided it at the protection hearing, otherwise she must accept all of the allegations as proof of the protection finding pursuant to section 22(2) (k). HELD: The order of production was granted. The documents requested will not be produced for the purpose of monitoring compliance with the orders made. Costs will be placed on service providers who are asked to produce only relevant records or to prepare report or answer interrogatories. This may place a greater burden on the service provider than does merely copying all of its files."

The lift ceased to operate and San Diego contacted the Abilities Council which claimed ownership to the lift. San Diego was awarded judgment for the depreciated value against Kapronczai who joined the Jabours as third parties claiming over against them for the San Diego claim. HELD: The appeal was dismissed against the plaintiff and the third party. 1)The wheelchair lift never became part of the realty notwithstanding how it was affixed. It was not the intention of either party that it become part of the realty. The intention of the parties is a prime factor in determining whether something is affixed to and becomes part of the realty. 2)The manner of attaching the lift only to the concrete slab arguably showed an intention that it not be permanent and part of the property.  3)Section 237(2) of the Land Titles Act protects a purchaser of realty against an unregistered interest in that realty.

Mabel, mother of the plaintiff and the defendant, set aside $20,000 in a bank account. Prior to her death, Mabel gave written instructions to the defendant to give $5,000 to each granddaughter. The defendant claimed that the money was to be held to pay the estate's expenses and then be divided among Mabel's children. The money was never issued to the granddaughters. The plaintiff claims that the written instructions to the defendant constituted the establishment of a trust and that the defendant is the trustee of the money for the benefit of the granddaughters. HELD: Plaintiff's claim dismissed with costs to the defendant to be taxed at double column 2. An incomplete voluntary transfer will not be construed as a declaration of trust unless it appears that there is an intention to declare a trust, and not merely make a transfer. Mabel's written instructions do not contain any words that could possibly be construed as a declaration of trust. She intended to make monetary gifts. The fact that the defendant did not take the necessary steps to complete the intended gifts during Mabel's lifetime does not result in that intention being converted into a declaration of trust. As to costs, the plaintiff alleged that the defendant committed fraud and this was never withdrawn nor proven. Asserting an unfounded allegation of fraud justifies a special order as to costs.","The plaintiff alleged that the defendant had wrongfully, in breach of a trust, retained the sum of $20,000 to which his four daughters were entitled.

The plaintiff retained the money in 1992 as the mother's bank account. In 1995, Wanda's name was added to the account as joint owner. In 1998, Mabel's cancer was terminal. She died on March 24, 1998 at which time there was still $25,000 in the bank account in the joint names of the plaintiff and the defendant. 2) In 1992, the defendant placed $17,500 in the name of the mother.

The tenant appealed on the grounds the Rentalsman erred in law, as the decision was patently unreasonable as unsupportable by the facts; there was a denial of natural justice and due process because there was insufficient notice of particulars of the cleaning claim to allow the tenant to prepare a full and proper defence. The tenant argued there was a denial of natural justice and the decision should be overturned because he was not aware he could ask for an adjournment to present further evidence. HELD: The appeal was dismissed. The tenant was not denied natural justice or due process. While the description of cleaning did not specifically state the number of hours or hourly rate, it was sufficient to alert the tenant that it was for hours of work as well as for painting.

She also asks that the Court determine the ongoing child support amount to be paid by the petitioner father. The Court questioned whether this application was more in the nature of a variation of the Gunn, J. order. It is clear that there has been a change since September 2008 with respect to the residency of one of the children.HELD: 1) The father's unusual 2008 taxation year has led to the parties taking very different positions as to how the father's income should be calculated. The father argues that it would be appropriate to average the father's income for 2006 to 2008. The mother argues that his income is the sum set out on line 150 of his tax return. She argues that his total income is the sum of $302,196 for the 2008 year. The father's argument is that the severance he received in 2008 should not be included in his income. It is well established that severance pay represents an acceleration of income that would have been paid over a period of months. It is also well established that income for the basis of calculating child support should be determined on the basis of severance pay plus whatever other earnings the payor may have. The severance is included as part of the father's income. 2) The capital gain which shows on the father's 2008 income tax return shall not be included in his 2008 income. The father agreed as part of the distribution of family income to assume responsibility for the capital gain on the real estate he was receiving as part of the family property division. The gain does not reflect income actually received by the father and there will be no 'year to year' capital gains. See Andersen v. Andersen (1997), 32 R.F.L. (4th) 177. 3) The father's income for 2008 is $270,300.  4) If the parties were to proceed in accordance with their own agreement and consent order, the father would be forced to pay on his inflated 2008 income. However, the mother would then be forced to pay back to the father the overpayment. As of May 2009 the father's income is the sum of $160,000. 5) The mother shall have her costs of $600.","The mother has filed a motion in this matter requesting an order quantifying child support arrears which she says are due and owing pursuant to the 2008 order. As the Gunn J. order is premised on the child residing with the mother and the father, David no longer lives with either parent. HELD: 1) The father's income is $160,000. With respect to the capital gain shown on the father's 2008 income tax return, it is clear that the father will not earn the sum of $270,000 in the 2009 taxation year. The father has only one source of income, which is his new employment. 2) The parties have agreed to a split custody arrangement whereby the father is to pay support for two children based on an income of $140,000 for the months from May to August 2009. The gain does not reflect income actually received by the father and there will be no year to year capital gain unless the father has gains on other property."
3_1999canlii12258.txt,An appeal from an order varying a child maintenance order which had been based on a written agreement between the parties entered into a week before the Federal Child Support Guidelines came into effect. The application to vary made about a year later was based mainly on the coming into effect of the guidelines. The decision to not to allow evidence on all issues because of conflicting affidavits gave rise to the first ground of appeal. The appellant also argued that the judge erred in finding that an order to vary would not be inequitable within the meaning of s.17(6.2) by reason of the terms of the written agreement and resulting order which contained special provisions to benefit the children. He also objected to the s.7(1)(f) order for $230 per month for extraordinary extracurricular expenses. HELD: The appeal was dismissed with the exception of the payments under s.7(1)(f) which were set aside. 1)The applicant was not denied the right to lead evidence on any relevant issue. Although the judge made no reversible error the procedure followed was not approved of. The principles stated in Zaba v. Bradley were reaffirmed. 2)No reversible error was found in the finding the appellant did not have custody of or access to the children for enough time to bring him within s.9; that the appellant's income for purposes of the Guidelines should include the bonuses received from his employer; and that he did not have a business based in his home. 3)The judge erred in not addressing the question as to whether the expenses were extraordinary within the meaning of s.7(1)(f). The activities were ordinary given the income of the parents and fell within the table amount fixed under s.3(1)(a).  4)Each party was to bear his/her own costs.,"The parties appealed an order which varied a child maintenance order. The original order had been based on a written agreement between the parties entered into about a week before the Federal Child Support Guidelines came into effect. The application to vary was based mainly on the coming into effect of the guidelines. HELD: The appeal was dismissed. The court found no reversible error in the judge's decision, explained in the reasons for judgment, to reject the appellant's arguments respecting that issue. In all of the circumstances, we can not see that the appellant was deprived of the right to lead evidence on any relevant issue. However, we do wish to affirm the principles stated in Zaba v. Bradley (1996), 137 Sask. R. 295 (Sask. C.A.). Another ground of appeal was that the judge erred in finding an order to vary would not be inequitable within the meaning of s. 17(6.2) of the Divorce Act by reason of the terms of the written agreement and resulting order, which contained special provisions to benefit the children."

The claimant attempted to proceed in Nova Scotia on the basis of reciprocal enforcement under the common law or enforcement of the debt as a contract. The adjudicator dismissed the action, finding that the Small Claims Court did not have the authority to enforce an order arising from a foreign jurisdiction and that it could not proceed with the claim for breach of the agreement under the contract as there was no evidence that the Alberta action had been withdrawn, struck or transferred out. The adjudicator also found that the defendant had not attorned to the jurisdiction of the Alberta court. The claimant appealed. Appeal dismissed; although the adjudicator's interpretation of sec. 15 of the Act and his finding that the defendant had not attorned to the jurisdiction of the Alberta court when there was no evidence before him on that issue constituted errors in law, the present claim was beyond the scope of the Small Claims Court Act, given that the adjudicator would first be called upon to settle a dispute regarding the original court's jurisdiction, the locus of the original contract and a factual dispute concerning attornment.","The claim was reduced from the amount of its judgment to fall within the monetary limits established by the Small Claims Court Act and in the alternative, enforcement of the debt as contract.

The parties appeared before the judge for hearing on the issue of whether the Alberta Court had jurisdiction to hear the claim filed by the defendant. The adjudicator determined that Section 9 of the Act did not provide the Court with authority to enforce an Order arising from foreign jurisdiction. He further determined that, although the Court has jurisdiction to proceed with the claim for a breach of the agreement under contract, it was prohibited as there was no evidence 'that the Alberta action was withdrawn, abandoned, struck out or transferred' pursuant to Section 15 of the act. Taking into account the purpose of the legislation, the remedial goals, the underlying values of efficiency and access to justice, and the potential for a complex fact finding process, the defendant did not attorn to the Alberta jurisdiction."
2_1999nsca132.txt,"The respondent filed an interlocutory notice, ex parte application, against the intended defendants, seeking an interim injunction. The applicant union applied for leave to obtain intervener status as a party pursuant to Rule 62.35, or as amicus currie pursuant to Rule 8.02, or alternatively as an intervener pursuant to Rules 5.02, 5.04, and 8.01(1), and to bring an appeal from orders made by a Supreme Court judge in proceedings brought by the intended plaintiff against the intended defendants. Rejecting the applications, that a Court of Appeal judge sitting in chambers does not have the jurisdiction to grant intervener status or to join a person as a party to a proceeding. Furthermore, as the union was not a party to the original proceeding, and was not joined as an intervener, or as a party defendant, by order of a Supreme Court judge, it does not have standing to file an appeal.","The union applied for leave to obtain intervener status as a party pursuant to Civil Procedure Rules 5.02, 5.04, and 8.01(1) and to bring an appeal from orders made in September 1999 and October 1st, 1999. The Union argued that there was an arguable issue within the meaning of s. 44 of the Judicature Act and that the matter put before the Supreme Court in the initial Ex-Parte Interim Application and placed again on the return date of September 30th, 1999 was a 'labor-management dispute'. The Union sought to be joined as an intervener pursuant to Rule 62.35 or Rule 8. The Court dismissed the application for the continuation of the injunction on the ground that the Union did not have the status to file an appeal pursuant to either of the Rules. Rule 8 is not relied upon by the Union. It is the proper forum to enable both parties to adduce evidence in support of their respective opposed submissions. In the absence of any affidavits filed on behalf of the Union before Justice Tidman supporting any submission to join the Union under Rule 7, or Rule 5, or any other Rule, the Union's application for an extension of time and place of service was dismissed as a result of the applications presently before the Court. There are additional cogent reasons that influence me to refuse the relief requested."

With respect to EK the Department seeks an order placing him with the Minister until his 16th birthday. This order was granted at trial. The parents do not oppose the applications with respect to JS and EK but the mother seeks the return of CS to her care. HELD: JS is in need of protection and he shall be placed with SK for an indefinite period. JS shall not be returned to live with his parents without a further order of this Court. This does not prevent JS from spending unsupervised time with his parents including overnight visits. CS is in need of protection and she shall remain in the custody of the Minister for a period of 3 months. During that time, the parents shall work with DCR to develop a case plan for CS's return. TK will have a mental health assessment as arranged for by DCR and will follow any recommendations of the mental health professional and participate in the Victim Intervention Program. KS will attend any session at Alternatives to Violence arranged for by DCR. 1) The Court was satisfied that the children were exposed to domestic violence or severe domestic disharmony. 2) Matters did not move quickly once the children were placed in the care of DCR. Instead of working with DCR to ensure a smooth reintegration of the children into their home, the parents vacated their apartment, moved to Alberta for a while, lived in a series of motels, camped at SK's apartment building and even lived in a tent. During that period of time, some of which encompassed the trial, the Court was not satisfied that there was an adult person who was willing and able to provide for the children's needs. The children are in need of protection within the meaning of s. 11 of the Act. 3) There is a reasonable prospect of change within a reasonable period of time. KS has quit drinking. TK is now employed. KS has attended some anger management programming flowing from his criminal conviction. The parents have a residence. TK is taking medication which promotes the continuation of her mental health. DCR acknowledged that there are no current issues with TK's mental health and that have not been for some time. TK says she is prepared to work with DCR to ensure the return of her children. The Court accepts TK's disinclination to work with Ms. Fraser. The success of the involvement of DCR in the life of this family would be enhanced with the assignment of another worker.","The Department of Community Resources seeks orders pursuant to The Child and Family Services Act placing the child with the Department until age 18, but in view of the child's stated intention to return to his parents' home on his 16th birthday, which was granted at trial. The children have the same biological parents. The child does not appear to be of sufficient interest to the Department. HELD: The Children have been in the care of the Department since April 30, 2004. The trial commenced June 26, 2006 and concluded September 29, 2006. J.S. did not attend the pre-trial or the trial. He was served with the notice of the application, and the trial notice. The purpose of the Act is to promote the well-being of children in need of protection by offering, wherever appropriate, services that are designed to maintain, support and preserve the family in the least disruptive manner. Where person or court is required by any provision of this Act other than s. 49(2) to determine the best interests of a child, the person or Court must take into account the quality of the relationships the child has with such persons. The most recent child is 13 years of age and is currently residing with his grandmother. He is currently attending Hillcrest School and is attending Grade 8. The oldest child is residing with the mother. The youngest child is 11 years old and in Grade 12. The middle child is also attending school and is doing well academically. Although he is not attending school right now, he has started to become more open and has lots of friends. He enjoys watching baseball and soccer. The younger child is experiencing some problems with his ADHD but overall seems to be doing well. The older child is showing signs of improvement but is not able to handle school work. The mother is seeking an order placing the middle child (ages 12 and 13) with her grandmother as a Person of Sufficient Interest (PPSI) until he reaches the age of 18 years. The parties are cohabitating and the court will provide release so that the Department might obtain information as to the mother's treatment compliance from her mental health professionals and mental health facilities."

HELD: The application lacked compelling reasons to keep the young person in custody.  1) This was the first experience with an application of this nature in Saskatoon and the Court provided a detailed discussion of the procedure for the benefit of future applications. 2) The application was not brought in a reasonable time having regard to all of the circumstances. The young person must be put on notice that the application is being made. 3) The Review (Progress) Report is a form of disclosure for the young person and should be available well in advance of the hearing.",An application for continuation of custody of a custody and supervision sentence made pursuant to s. 42(2)(n) of the Youth Criminal Justice Act. HELD: The accused was released pending a full hearing of the application. 1)The Court was aware that there had been a meeting to discuss the conditions of his supervision in the community. The representatives of the Provincial Director had yet to consider conditions of supervision in light of this latest decision to make.  2)The accused had two previous convictions for offences of which he had served a portion of the term of his current sentence. The most recent conviction was for an assault on his girlfriend who was pregnant at the time. He was charged with robbery. The Crown did not have any convictions for this assault. The accused had a Grade 12 education and a Baccalaureate degree. The Court was not able to explain the reference to the'repeated use of knives'. 3)There were a number of options short of continuing open custody which can increase the level of supervision but are intended to be taken rarely. Section 98(3)(a) provides for at least days notice in writing to the young person and his/her parent. 4)A review of the conditions in s. 98(2) requires a factor of at least 180 days in custody and 90 days remaining for community supervision. 5)The application was brought because the Court had not been served on the accused prior to the hearing.  6)Individual custody was to be continued until the expiry of the youth sentence.
8_1997canlii9861.txt,"This was an appeal from a Supreme Court decision dismissing certiorari applications to quash three orders of the Labour Relations Board ordering the appellant to reinstate the respondents and pay them compensation for dismissing them due to their support of a union. The appellant alleged that the Board's order should be quashed because it failed to give reasons for its decision. Allowing the appeal and remitting the matter for rehearing, that there is an implied duty on a tribunal to provide written reasons whenever substantial issues are involved and the reasons for the tribunal's decision are not obvious from a review of the issues and the record. In this case, the order of the Board imposed significant financial liability on the appellant, and the issues were complex and the concerns of the parties were substantial. As a result, the Board acted in a patently unreasonable manner in giving its decision without providing reasons.","The respondent hotel manager appealed three orders of the Labour Relations Board (Nova Scotia) ordering her to reinstate the individual respondents, to pay them compensation and to reconsider the first two orders. The union members who had filed complaints against the respondent also appealed. Allowing the appeal and remitting the matter for a rehearing, that the Board is not bound by legislation to provide reasons for decisions it has made, and that in the absence of such a requirement reasons are not generally mandated, the Board's order must be quashed because it failed to give reasons, it is not necessary to deal with the other issues."
1990canlii2449.txt,"This was an appeal from a decision dismissing the appellant's application for an order in the nature of certiorari to quash the decision of the Social Assistance Appeal Board for the City of Halifax which affirmed the rejection of the appellant's application for municipal social assistance as an expectant mother. The appellant was a pregnant unmarried 16 year old living with her parents at the time of her application for social assistance. The trial judge concluded that under Municipal Assistance Policy 1.2.5 the applicant was not eligible since she was not a single head of a family maintaining a home for herself and her dependant child. Allowing the appeal, that s. 23(1) of the Social Assistance Act places a mandatory responsibility upon social service committees to provide assistance for all persons in need as defined in s. 19(e) of the Act. Pursuant to this statute, the City of Halifax has approved municipal assistance policies and Policy 1.2.5 relating to an 'Unmarried Mother - Pending Birth' was intended to set out the circumstances under which an unmarried mother was to be eligible. It was not intended that the appellant have to be already maintaining a home for herself and one or more dependant children. In a dissenting opinion, Chipman, J.A. concluded that as the provision with respect to an 'Unmarried Mother - Pending Birth' came under the heading 'Single Head of Family', the provision is merely an extension to include within the definition of a single head of a family an unwed mother whose child is not yet born. The requirement that she be a single head of a family maintaining a home still stands.","An unmarried, pregnant, 16 year old girl applied to the Social Services Department of the City of Halifax for municipal social assistance. Her application was refused because she was under 19 years of age and was living with and being supported by her mother and stepfather. The appellant appealed. Dismissing the appeal, that although an unmarried mother pending the birth of her first child could qualify for assistance, she was not the head of family maintaining a home for herself and a dependent child. The evidence did not establish that the appellant was a person in need within the definition of 'expectant mothers' under Municipal Social Assistance Policy 1.2.5'. The fact that she was an expectant mother and living in the home of her parents was not sufficient to qualify her for assistance. Rather, the appellant's application was based on an eligibility category for 'expecting mothers', which in this case included the unwed mother of a child."

The insured had signed a promissory note and tendered a cheque payable in September 1996 but stopped payment and advanced a claim of set-off. HELD: The appeal was allowed in part under Rule 129 without prejudice to the plaintiff's right to proceed for the alleged loss of $38,585. 1)The appellant was granted leave to amend its statement of defence by pleading the relevant statutory conditions in the Saskatchewan Insurance Act and any additional material facts and new matters raised by the amended statement of claim. The plaintiff was granted leave to reply. Each party was permitted to re-open the examinations for discovery. 2)The insured had no defence to the counterclaim for premiums which was a separate action.

The appellant contended that the plaintiff's claim was fixed at $3,373.50 being the amount of an appraisal award and that the respondent challenged the validity of this appraisal award purporting to be made under The Saskatchewan Insurance Act and the statutory conditions that govern such appraisals. The respondent then stopped payment of the same with a claim of set-off being advanced.

b_2000skqb572.txt,"The accused was charged with sexual assault under s.271 of the Criminal Code. Although the DNA evidence established he had sexual intercourse with the complainant, neither had any memory of it due to their self-induced states of intoxication. Defences raised were consent, an honest but mistaken belief that she gave her consent, and extreme drunkenness such that he was so intoxicated that he was not in a conscious state and was incapable of forming any intent to have sexual intercourse without consent. HELD: The accused was found guilty.  1)Although the defence of 'extreme intoxication' is successful in the rarest of cases, the accused established the Daviault 'extreme intoxication' on a balance of probabilities. He would have been acquitted had it not been for s.33.1 which does away with this defence in sexual assault cases.  2)The court was satisfied on a balance of probabilities that his extreme level of self-induced intoxication rendered him incapable of making a conscious decision to have sexual intercourse with the complainant with or without her consent. The court was satisfied that the complainant had not done anything to suggest that she would consent. The accused was incapable of considering the issue of consent and accordingly did not have a mistaken belief or reasonable grounds for such a belief. It was clear from the testimony of an 11 year old that the intercourse took place long after the complainant passed out. She was incapable of giving consent after that time. Her assertion of lack of consent was inherently unreliable due to her lack of any memory of events that occurred before, during and after the alleged assault and would have been more in the nature of an assumption than a fact, but was found to be consistent with all the other evidence. It was not relevant that she may have withdrawn consent. 3)There was no evidence to give his second defence (that he honestly believed he had her consent) an air of reality. His assertion that she must have consented or he would not have done it was speculative assumption, not evidence. 4)Section 33.1 provides that the act of becoming voluntarily intoxicated to the extent of being incapable of controlling one's behaviour constitutes criminal culpability sufficient to found criminal liability for offences committed against the bodily integrity of others. The public outcry and Parliamentary response to Daviault strongly indicate that s.33.1 is not only consistent with the objectives of the Charter but is justifiable and essential in a free and democratic society. Of four recent cases that held Criminal Code s.33.1 violates the Charter, two held it was saved by s.1 while two held it was not saved by s.1 of the Charter. 5)Section 33.1(1) provides the lack of general intent or voluntariness is not a defence to an assault charge described in ss.(3)if it resulted from self-induced intoxication or the accused departed markedly from the standard of reasonable care generally recognized in Canadian society. The three sub-conditions described in ss.(2) concerning marked departure constitute criminal culpability similar to recklessness. Criminal culpability is not dependent on wilful intention to cause harm but on the wilful intention to engage in conduct that incurs the risk of harm without caring whether or not harm ensues. 6)The strong dissent in Daviault indicated those who render themselves incapable of knowing what they are doing through voluntary consumption of alcohol or drugs possess a sufficiently blameworthy state of mind that their imprisonment does not offend the principle of fundamental justice which prohibits the imprisonment of the innocent. The court has broad discretion to differentiate in sentences imposed for offences that were deliberately committed and those that were committed involuntarily because of self-induced intoxication.","The accused was charged with sexual assault contrary to s. 271 of the Criminal Code. The DNA evidence established that the accused had sexual intercourse with the complainant. However, neither the accused nor the complainant, due to their respective self-induced states of intoxication, had any memory of the sexual intercourse. HELD: The accused was convicted of sexual assault. The Court had broad discretion to differentiate in sentences imposed for offences that were deliberately committed and those that were committed involuntarily because of self- induced intoxication. The defence of 'extreme drunkenness' was successful in the rarest of cases. The accused testified that he didn't even think about having sexual intercourse that morning until his sister was able to arouse him and he never considered the issue of her consent or lack of it. The facts were very different from those in the case before and the accused departed markedly from the standard of reasonable care generally recognized in Canadian society as described in ss. (2) and (3d) 1. It was difficult to understand how a person who was so grossly intoxicated could be capable of having sex that involved penetrating the complainant and ejaculating semen into her vagina, but the Court found that such a defence was not supported by the evidence subsequently adduced by the defence. There was no case that analyses the second condition described in R. v. Daviault (1996), 46 C.R. (4th) 124 (Ont. C.A.)."
1994canlii5055.txt,FIAT The accused was charged with four counts of defamatory libel. The alleged defamatory words were on a placard he exhibited while picketing in a public place. He was released from custody on his consent to a term that prohibited him from picketing or carrying placards pending his trial. He later applied for a review of the order and sought an amendment permitting him to picket lawfully. HELD: Application dismissed. Amendment refused. If the accused was permitted to picket there was a substantial likelihood that he would commit another offence while on bail pending his trial on the four existing charges. The justice granting the judicial interim release order was therefore correct to impose a complete prohibition on picketing.,"The accused applied for a review of the terms of his judicial interim release. He was charged with four counts of defamatory libel under s.300 and 301 of the Code. He and his counsel consented to a judicial interim released order containing certain terms. The accused sought an amendment by adding the phrase'regarding Sgt. Brian Dueck or Carol Bunko-Ruys'. HELD: The application was denied. The picketing prohibition term imposed by the justice with the consent of the accused was reasonably constituted as a condition of his release from custody. But for this condition the justice might well have ordered the accused detained in custody on the ground that there was a substantial likelihood that the accused would commit a criminal offence if he were not prohibited from picketing prior to his trial'.  1)Had the accused been permitted to continue to picket or carry placards pending his trial, he would have been restricted to lawful activity. 2)The picketing was reasonably prudent in the circumstances and nature of the case. The provisions of the interim release order were reasonably satisfied as well as those of the criminal justice system. 3)If the amendment was not made he would restrict his picketing to lawfulactivity."

Hypothetical questions seeking his opinion consequent upon his professional experience could be asked where his and C&amp;L's conduct were in issue. The officer's expert opinion could not be sought on matters not raised in the pleadings. 2)The disclosure and production of documents was justified under the broad relevance test. A party is entitled to discovery of a document if it directly or indirectly enables him to advance his own case or destroy that of his adversary or may fairly lead to a form of inquiry which may have either consequence. 3)The 'damage claim documents' had been provided. There should be a sameness in the manner and isolation of the documents in the discovery process undertaken by each party. Whether the memoranda of discussions with third parties were privileged or irrelevant was a matter for the trial judge. 4)The issue of compelling a response to undertakings had been resolved. 5)The request for an order for an immediate pre-trial conference was redundant as there was no basis for one until the action was ready for trial. 6)Leave to further amend the statement of claim pursuant to Rule 165 had been granted.,"FIAT. The chambers judge granted an order directing the defendants to respond to the undertakings given inthe examination for discovery of the plaintiff and ordered that the documents be of minimal use, even of no relevance, in resolving the issues raised by the pleadings. HELD: The order of the Court was that the plaintiff should seek the designation of a case-management judge in the action and that the defendants should provide the plaintiff with the specific information requested.  1)The plaintiff failed to provide proper answers to the questions posed by the defendants. 2)The defendants were ordered to produce all of the documents requested. 3)Costs were to be determined by the trial judge on the basis of the divided success in considering both in tandem."

The appellant's non-appearance at the hearing did not have the benefit of any evidence or submissions from the appellant. The judge decided the application on the evidence before him.  1) The appellant might well have brought an application in Queen’s Bench under rule 271. Any verdict or judgment obtained, where one party does not appear at trial, may be set aside by the court upon such terms as may be just, upon an application made within 15 days after the trial.

2008skpc160.txt,"The accused is charged with aggravated assault. A voir dire was held to determine whether the accused's s. 8, s. 9, s. 10(a) and s. 10(b) Charter rights were breached. HELD: There was no breach of the accused's Charter rights. 1) There is no evidence to establish that the accused did not speak to legal counsel. The agreed statement of facts establishes that the accused asked to speak with Ms. Bohachik, a lawyer with Legal Aid. The police officer put the accused in contact with legal aid duty counsel instead. When the officer told the accused that Ms. Bohachik worked with Legal Aid the accused said 'ok, Legal Aid is fine'. The accused was put in contact with Legal Aid duty counsel. There was no breach of the accused s. 10(b) rights.  2) Applying the common law definition of arrest to the present situation, it is apparent that telling a person that he is no longer under arrest, without releasing him from custody, does not terminate the arrest. It is only by ending the custody of the accused by releasing him that the arrest is ended and the accused is 'un-arrested'. It was agreed that the officer had sufficient grounds to arrest the accused. The arrest being legally made, it follows that the arrest continued until it was legally ended by his release. The arrest continued throughout the search and seizure at the police station. The Court finds that his continued detention after the purported 'un-arrest' constituted a de facto arrest. 3) There is no evidence that the accused misunderstood his actual status or that he was prejudiced by the 'un-arrest'. The accused has not established that he was the subject of 'unreasonable search or seizure' resulting in the violation of his rights under the Charter.","The accused was charged with aggravated assault. Prior to his trial, the accused gave notice that he would be making an application to the Court for a ruling that the accused's rights under s. 8, 9, and 10 (a) and (b) of the Charter had been infringed and sought remedy for that infringement. At the trial, Crown counsel called six witnesses to testify and during the course of the evidence of the sixth witness, requested that the Court enter a voir dire. The purpose of the voir net was to hear and determine an application by counsel for the accused for a finding that the rights of the accused under ss. 8 and 9 (a and b) and s. 10(b) and 10(c) had be infringed. HELD: The Court held that the initial arrest was lawful, was not terminated by the purported 'un-arrest', and continued throughout the search and seizure at the police station. Even if the accused were in error in that finding, his continued detention after the purported “de facto” arrest constituted a de facto arrest as described in Latimer. The accused was not only put in direct contact with counsel after having said that legal aid was fine, but he had the immediate and reasonable opportunity to contact a particular Legal Aid duty counsel."

The original five year lease for use of the Jubilee Building as a bingo hall between Fundraising td. and REAL was assigned to GCB with REAL's written consent. GCB further sublet the building without REAL's consent or knowledge. Written notice of renewal was not sent to REAL. The basis of GCB's application was estoppel on the basis that REAL entered negotiations regarding a relocation of the bingo hall and then began to deal directly with CGB's sub-tenant after the renewal date had passed. HELD: The application was dismissed. Costs in the cause. 1)There was no evidence that Fundraisers, the original party to the lease, attempted to exercise the option to renew. 2)GCB did not have a strong prima facie case on the merits. It appeared that there were no negotiations between GCB and REAL. 3)There would not be irreparable harm. Under the current arrangements, the bingo would be operated by RCBA. If successful at trial the damages to GCB can be easily calculated based on the time it was unable to occupy the premises. 4)On balance GCB failed to satisfy the burden of proof that the inconvenience it will suffer by the refusal of the injunction will be greater than that suffered by REAL if granted.","The plaintiff applied for an interim injunction restraining the defendant from entering into any lease with the plaintiff and permitting the operation of a bingo hall by the defendant except as a subtenant. The applicant sought an interlocutory injunction restraining REAL from interfering with the defendant's enjoyment of certain leasehold premises including the Jubilee Building as tenant from and after September 1, 1996. REAL was not aware of the sublease and was not asked to provide its consent, as required by the lease and the first sublease. HELD: The application was dismissed. The court found that the applicant had failed to satisfy the burden of proof that the plaintiff will suffer from the refusal of the injunction greater than that which will be suffered if it is granted.  1)The applicant had entered into a verbal agreement for the defendant to terminate the lease but there was no promise on the part of REAL that it would follow up on these discussions nor was there any discussion about waiving any requirements with respect to its exercising the option to renew either through the defendant or directly.  2)There was no evidence that the parties met once to discuss the future of the hotel. The parties met only once. 3)The defendant had undertaken a new course of conduct for bingo at the Exhibition Park. 4)The plaintiff was not able to show that the defendant, the party with whom REAL had contracted, exercised or attempted to exercise the option."
c_2006nsca45.txt,"The president of a company against whom the Securities Commission had ordered an investigation applied to the court for certiorari to quash the investigation. He alleged that the investigators had improperly obtained and used the contents of his email, some of which were subject to solicitor and client privilege. In the context of the certiorari application, the company president successfully argued that the Commission's return should contain the fruits of the investigation so far and that he should be entitled to examine one of the investigators for discovery. The Commission appealed, arguing that the underlying judicial review application was improper and premature and thus, the procedural orders should not have been made. Appeal allowed; the underlying judicial review application is stayed; the stay may be lifted by a judge of the Supreme Court on application with notice; the Order of the chambers judge on the procedural matters arising in that application is set aside. The underlying judicial review application was premature because the Commission should have had the opportunity to consider and address the company president's complaints. The decision as to whether or not to release the information sought required the balancing of competing interests in light of the overall statutory scheme and the specific circumstances of the case; the Commission was in the best position to conduct such an exercise.","The respondent received an investigation order (which was amended on a couple of occasions) for the investigation of the securities of Knowledge House Inc. Mr. Potter applied to the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia for certiorari to quash the investigation and for an order to return all of the emails, documents and other information obtained during the investigation to him. The chambers judge essentially granted the respondent's application and dismissed the applicant's's's application. The parties then argued that the underlying judicial review application was improper and premature and that, as a result, the procedural orders under appeal should not have been entertained. The respondent argued that he should have taken his complaints to the Court, not to the Courts, because the Court had not yet considered the appropriateness of his application on this interlocutory appeal. HELD: The Court granted leave to appeal and instructed the Court to continue the application until the matter is resolved in the Court's favour.  1)The Court found that s. 29A of the Act does not clearly take away the power of the superior courts to order disclosure. The Act provides that investigative material be kept confidential unless the Commission or the Court grants permission for its release. The Commission appears to have the power and the tools to address the issues of solicitor-client privilege.  2)The respondent was a person directly affected by the Commission's investigation orders and, in particular, by the way the investigation authorized by those orders has been conducted. He alleges serious impropriety on the part of the investigators and that they required a warrant issued by a judge under s27(5) to obtain his email records. While the substance of the privilege issue is pure question of general law, the issue is how to balance the interests of the courts in the field of securities regulation in the public interest. A number of administrative and practical issues to be addressed, such as how the investigation should respond to the risk that privileged materials have been obtained, how the Commission should have invoked the process under s29F(3) to permit disclosure of 'any information or evidence obtained' and in forwarding information to the RCMP, thereby tainting the process."

The appellant also argued that the trial judge erred in preferring the evidence of the Crown's witness over his own. HELD: The appeal was dismissed. The trial judge gave sufficient reasons for her decision and took all of the relevant evidence into consideration.

The finding of the trial judge that the appellant must have known an accident had taken place before entering the store is contrary to the preponderance of evidence.

Children to remain with the mother until the end of the school year, at which point primary care of the children will be granted to the applicant; child support adjusted accordingly. The mother's decision to move was not in the children's best interests and it was done either to frustrate or with a callous indifference to the children's relationship with their father.","The parties, who were married in 1993 and separated in May 2005, applied to have the parties share joint custody of the children, whose primary residence was in Halifax. The respondent had since unilaterally moved the children to Bridgewater, one hour from Halifax, changing their school, changed their after-school care and provided access to the children who resided in the same area as the parties. There had been some difficulty in the parties' communication regarding the move, especially with respect to the mother's opposition to the father's ability to exercise access. The mother had significant contact with both parties' families. The parties' ability to meet the children's needs as required by the Court Order was disrupted. The father had to pay child support of $238 per month for the two children, which was reduced to $25 per month as a result of the mother unilaterally moving the children from their school and after school care to Bridgewater. This was an exceptional occurrence and it was in their best interests to remain in the primary care of the father."
7_2006nspc61.txt,"A young person who suffered from considerable mental health issues and was in the permanent care of the Minister of Community Services applied to have the court exclude the public and the media from her court convened pre- sentencing conference. The purpose of the conference was to assemble various professionals from diverse fields to discuss the complex issues surrounding the young person and to provide recommendations to the court as to an appropriate sentence. Various of the professionals had expressed their concern as to their ability to participate in the conference if the media was present. Application for access by the media denied; order granted excluding the public and the media from the pre-sentencing conference; the benefits of an exclusion order outweigh the deleterious effect of restricting the public's right to freedom of expression and the freedom of the press. Although the court convened hearing is a public proceeding to which, prima facie, the open court principle applies, the attendance, cooperation and participation of the invitees to the conference (all professionals who were bound by laws, policies and agreements of confidentiality) was strictly voluntary and many, if not all, would be unable and unwilling to participate in a conference that was open to the public and the media. The administration of justice was furthered by the court obtaining the best possible information from those identified as best able to provide it so that recommendations flowing from the conference would lead to the best sentence for the youth. There were no alternative measures which would prevent or reduce the risk of non-participation by the professionals.","The accused appeared before the Youth Court and entered or confirmed guilty pleas to 31 offences involving assaultive behaviour, threats, property damage and breach of court orders in relation to group home placements. The accused applied to have the court exclude the public and the media from a pre-sentencing conference held to consider recommendations on a sentence for the accused. The Crown and the youth court argued that the conference should not be open to the public or the media. Counsel for the young person made an application under s. 132 of the Youth Criminal Justice Act requesting that the court include the media in its deliberations. The applicant argued that this was a public proceeding to which they should have access. Application dismissed; the use of conferences to deal with youth in conflict with the criminal law is recognized to be an extraordinary remedy and great care must be exercised in deciding whether to use this discretion. The evidence before the court rebutted the open court principle and supported an order pursuant to s.132 of the Act and the Supreme Court of Canada v. Ontario raised interesting issues regarding conferencing provisions of the YCJA, the 'open court principle' and the discretionary power of the Ministry of Community Services to exclude members of the public from the conference."
c_2000skqb232.txt,"FIAT. The husband seeks to vary the spousal support provisions of the parties' 1975 separation agreement. This agreement held that the sum of $550 (adjusted for inflation) is to be paid to the wife until she dies or remarries, whichever comes first. The applicant paid this amount (except for a unilateral deduction in 1995) for over 25 years. The basis of his application is that he is now retired and earning less income. In addition, the respondent now earns part-time income that she did not have at the time of the agreement. At the time of the agreement, the wife raised the couple's five children and received child support from the applicant. HELD: The application is dismissed with costs to the respondent. The SCC has held that in order for a Court to vary support provisions in a valid settlement, separation agreement or consent order, a material or radical change in circumstances causally connected to the marriage needs to be established. Retirement of one of the parties was reasonably foreseeable at the time they entered into the agreement. It was also foreseeable that retirement income is most often less than employment income. This is not the kind of radical unforeseen change in circumstance required to vary the support. The preamble of the parties' agreement states that they intended it to be a complete and final settlement. The applicant has always earned considerable income and continues to have a better standard of living than the respondent. The respondent's modest income does not provide grounds to vary the agreement as she still has a much lower standard of living that the applicant, even after receiving the spousal support.","FIAT: The divorced husband applied to vary the spousal support provisions contained in a separation agreement dated June 18, 1975. By virtue of paragraph 4(a) of the agreement the parties agreed the initial sum of $550 would be paid and further agreed 'the said payment shall continue until the wife remarried or died, whichever date occurs the sooner'. The agreement provided for an annual adjustment to the amount payable based upon the increase in the Consumer Price Index. The husband continued to pay $1,000 per month until 1995, when the amount was unilaterally reduced by the applicant to $627.55 per month. The fact it had occurred is not that kind of radical unforseen change in circumstance required to be established upon the authorities to support the variation application. Nor am I persuaded that the respondent's modest income provides any proper ground for variation of the agreements. She still has a much lower standard of living than the applicant even after taking into account the amount she is receiving as spousa support.

e_1998canlii13558.txt,"The bankrupt applied to annul his bankruptcy on the grounds that he received misinformation or had a misunderstanding concerning the effect of an assignment on the status of potential builders' lien claimants and because his assets had been undervalued. He also asserted that the bankruptcy proceedings were of no value to him as builders' lien claimants have status akin to secured creditors and could pursue the bankrupt personally for any deficiency that may arise if the home is sold and the proceeds distributed among the claimants. The trustee maintained the bankrupt was repeatedly advised or cautioned that bankruptcy may not affect the majority of his creditors. Subsequent appraisals placed the value of his unfinished home at $150,000 rather than $40,000. The bankrupt was now eligible to obtain mortgage financing but first had to get out of bankruptcy. The bankrupt had attempted an orderly payment of debts prior to bankruptcy and had considered proposal post-bankruptcy. HELD: The application for an order annulling the assignment was dismissed. 1)The bankrupt met the definition of an insolvent person at the date of the assignment. It would be dangerous to set a precedent which would allow such an application because of post-bankruptcy circumstances. An improved financial situation and the ability to pay debts in full should not be used as criteria to launch section181 application. 2)The bankrupt had not filed monthly financial statements nor made payments as agreed to cover the costs of the administration of the estate. The onus will be on the bankrupt to comply with the requirements of the trustee to qualify for an automatic discharge on November 15/98 or an early discharge as provided for in s168.1(2).","The bankrupt applied to annul his bankruptcy. Section 181 of the Bankruptcy and Insolvency Act reads as ""(1) Where in the opinion of the court, a receiving order ought not to have been made on an assignment ought not have been filed, the court may by order annul the bankruptcy."" This application was made twofold. Firstly, that the bankrupt received wrong legal advice concerning the effect of an assignment on the status of potential builders' lien claimants and secondly, that he thought the various subcontractors would not be able to pursue claims against the home he was constructing or against himself. HELD: The application was dismissed. 1)The bankrupt was far from a model bankrupt. He had yet to file monthly financial statements and had not made payments as agreed to cover the costs of the administration of the estate. 2)Section 181 vests wide discretion in the court when considering an application to annulate the assignment. The majority of creditors, who are secured, would also benefit from the bankrupt's request being granted. If the bankrupt met the definition of an insolvent personat the date of the assignment it would be dangerous for the trustee to order an annulment because he would have a precedent for filing an application like this which would set a dangerous precedent for another section of the Act which would result in the bankrupt having to re-examine his duties as a trustee in order to ensure his compliance with his obligations. 3)There were other actions by secured creditors returnable in Queen's Bench as early next week."
e_1999skqb151.txt,"The farm implement dealer and the defendant entered a standard form Finance Lease Agreement which provided for an 'advance payment' and semi-annual installments with the final 'termination value' payment to be paid at the defendant's option if he elected to purchase the sprayer. The central issue was whether the Agreement was a lease and liquidated damages should be awarded in accordance with clause two, or a conditional sales security agreement whereby the dealer was restricted to repossession and sale by s.46(2) of the Saskatchewan Farm Security Act. HELD: The plaintiff's claim was dismissed with costs on Column 3. 1)The Agreement was a conditional sales contract whereby title was reserved until the defendant elected to make the final payment. The transaction falls within the ambit of the Saskatchewan Farm Security Act and the dealer's right to recover the unpaid purchase price is restricted to repossession and sale. Although the dealer framed the Agreement as a lease the Agreement itself used notions of retail financing and secured party. Nomenclature such as principal, past due interest, conditional sales contract, purchase of equipment, and retail sales contract were used. The construction and interpretation of the nature of the Agreement is a question of law. The Agreement had many attributes of ownership and collectively showed that the defendant acquired a substantial interest in the sprayer. He had possession and unrestricted right to use the sprayer with high base hours. The total payments were equivalent to the total payments under sales contract. The defendant had the option to acquire title by making the final payment. He bore the risk of loss and obligation for maintenance and insurance. 2)The court could not determine whether the option price would be substantially less, equal or more than the June 2002 fair market value of the sprayer. 3)If the Agreement is lease the defendant's consent to give up possession was conditional upon his release from further liability. Case Credit cannot foreclose the entitlement to 40 days notice and take possession of the sprayer by relying upon conditional unwritten consent. To validate early repossession would defeat the intention of the legislation to protect creditors. Case could take possession only in accordance with Part IV of the SFSA. 4)If the Agreement is lease and covered by the SFSA, the defendant would be released from all liability under s.55. It would be unjust to make any further order in a summary trial without the benefit of discoveries or pre-trial conference and without evidence of the fair market value at the time of seizure. 5)If the Agreement is lease and not covered by the SFSA, it would be held that the dealer was not barred by implied acceptance of the condition the defendant be released from further liability because of the exclusionary clause. Judgment would have been granted for $42,089 with costs on Column 3.","The primary issue was whether the Agreement was a lease or a security agreement. The issue was not plead in defence but on the basis of Column 3 of Schedule I of the Tariff of Costs. HELD: The claim was dismissed. The defendant was awarded costs of $42,089.00 with costs of Column D of Tariff Of Costs. The court must be able to ascertain the probable value of the sprayer at the end of the Agreement, in light of the evidence that it depends on market fluctuations, cannot determine whether the option price is a'substantial sum' as being the test employed in the Ontario Equipment case. The trade-in as the advance payment was not a nominal amount but the Agreement did not define it in that way. The plaintiff was to have possession and be entitled to make the final termination value payment ($9,320.67); the difference being $679.60 for 'past due interest' as required for an order under s.55(c) of the Saskatchewan Farm Security Act. The agreement was a conditional sales contract whereby title was reserved until Mr. Poirier elected to pay the final payment (which was $10,122.72 for 'principal' and $149.60 per excess hour) and the right to recover the unpaid purchase money is restricted to repossession and sale."
c_2008skca28.txt,"The appellant agreed to buy a two-story condominium unit from the respondent developer. The building permit had not been obtained, nor had condominium titles been raised at the time the sale agreement was entered into. In the course of construction the respondent opted not to proceed with the two-story unit, revising it to a single story unit which was offered to the appellant. The appellant did not accept the offer, and registered a miscellaneous interest against the title to the entire parcel of land. The appellant sues for specific performance of the agreement and in the alternative, damages. The developer succeeded in obtaining a court order discharging the miscellaneous interest. The Court's jurisdiction to hear the appeal is found in s. 111 of The Land Titles Act, 2000. The issue is whether the appellant possessed an interest in land so as to support the registration of a miscellaneous interest. HELD: Appeal dismissed.  1) Before a condominium plan as defined in The Condominium Property Act, 1993 comes into being, there is nothing in the Act which directly or inferentially entertains the prospect that a purchase of a 'proposed unit' can constitute an interest in land, or a registrable interest for the purposes of s. 50 of The Land Titles Act, 2000. 2) The Act expressly prohibits the registration of any charge against the common property. The appellant is not entitled to rest his claim to a registrable interest in the surface parcel on the basis of a notional claim to rights in 'common property'. Common property, by definition, does not come into existence until the condominium plan comes into effect. 3) For the purposes of s. 50 of The Land Titles Act, 2000, the appellant had no basis in law, or under The Condominium Property Act, 1993 for asserting an interest against the surface parcel owned by the respondent.","The appellant agreed to purchase a two-storey condominium unit (Units and 6) from the respondent, developer. It was the only planned unit of its kind in the warehouse the developer proposed to convert to a 26 unit condominium complex. The developer opted not to proceed with the two-story unit, revising it instead to a single story unit (Unit 5). The appellant registered a miscellaneous interest against the title to the entire parcel of land. The Chambers judge agreed with the respondent that the appellant's ultimate remedy should lie in damages as opposed to specific performance and urged the respondent to file its statement of defence and proceed to resolution without further delay. The order was immediately registered in January 2007 and the appellant’s miscellaneous Interest was discharged from title. Two grounds of appeal were raised: (1) the appellant possessed a registrable interest in the surface parcel because he will never be successful in obtaining from this Court the remedy of specific performance in the circumstances of this case; (2) the Chambers judge did not err in the manner he did in calculating the registrarable interest; and (3) the application for registration of an interest was unsuccessful. The determination of appropriate remedies was premature at that stage of the proceedings."
e_2007skqb225.txt,"The Crown appeals the sentence to the extent that the victim surcharge was waived. The appeal is made on the basis that the trial judge did not comply with the mandatory provisions of s. 737 of the Criminal Code. HELD: The imposition of a victim fine surcharge under s. 737 of the code is mandatory subject only to an application under s. 737(5) relating to undue hardship. If an offender is exempted from payment of the victim surcharge, it is also mandatory that the Court give reasons. The sentence is varied to include an order requiring the respondent to pay a victim surcharge in the amount of $30.","HELD: The Crown appeals the sentence to the extent that the victim surcharge was waived. The appeal is made on the basis that the trial judge did not comply with the mandatory provisions of s. 737 of the Code. Section 737 states: 737. 1) Subject to subsection (5), an offender who is convicted or discharged under section 730 of an offence under this Act or the Controlled Drugs and Substances Act shall pay a Victim surcharge in addition to any other punishment imposed on the offender. 2) The sentencing judge failed to comply with s. 730(1) of the Criminal Code or, alternatively, the explicit provisions of ss. 737(5) and (6) of Code. This sentencing judge has consistently and consistently raised the issue of undue hardship. This is particularly true where the maximum sentence for assault is 15 years imprisonment or more. The maximum surcharge for common assault is $30.3 per cent of the total sentence, which is the maximum imposed in the entire criminal justice system. This type of sentence represents a serious breach of the entire system of justice and represents an important breach of an important set of obligations that must be paid out of the taxpayer's pocket. 3) In this case, the sentencing judge raised the maximum amount of surcharges by example of 15 per cent, which the Respondent was to pay in the amount of $30, despite the fact that the respondent had not requested an exemption pursuant to s730(5). 4) The trial judge clearly and consistently failed to meet the statutory obligations that are attached to this type of sentencing. This applies particularly to financial hardship, particularly in the context of a sentence of 15 years or more where a maximum sentence of 21 years has been imposed."

The appellant's memorandum of law and oral argument only addressed whether the police officer had reasonable and probable ground to arrest and demand his breath sample and asserted a violation of his rights pursuant to s. 8 and 9 Charter of Rights. HELD: The appeal was dismissed. The trial judge tested the officer's credibility and the judge's conclusion was supported by facts. The officer's belief was based on the observation that the appellant was driving with a flat tire, with windshield wipers operating on a clear night, as well as slurred speech and bloodshot eyes. The officer had reasonable and probable grounds to demand a sample of the appellant's breath.","An appeal from a conviction in the Provincial Court of Saskatchewan that the appellant did, having consumed alcohol in such a quantity that the concentration thereof in his blood exceeded 80 milligrams of alcohol in 100 milliliters of blood, operate a motor vehicle contrary to s.255(1) and s.253(b) of the Criminal Code. HELD: The appeal was dismissed. 1)The trial judge was in a position to test the credibility of the trial judge. In coming to his conclusion he considered the totality of the evidence, he considered whether the trial Judge's factual findings were entitled to deference and held that the officer had reasonable and probable grounds to make a demand for a sample of the appellant’s breath. 2)The evidence was clear that the respondent had slurred speech and bloodshot eyes. Even excluding those indicia, the remaining indicia which the officer observed provided ample evidence to support her belief the appellant was operating his motor vehicle while his ability to do so was impaired. 3)The court found that the verdict was reasonable and supported by the evidence. It was not clear if the appellant had fainted or had a cleft lip and considered that that may have affected his speech."
5_2007skpc74.txt,"Decision, following a voir dire, on the admissibility of statements made by the accused to a police officer, beginning with: 'Excuse me, I was in a roll-over accident and I am intoxicated.' The officer, who observed symptoms of impairment, asked the accused how much he had had to drink and was told he had consumed about 15 beers. The officer placed the accused under arrest for impaired operation of a motor vehicle, and read him his Charter rights, the Police Warning and a Demand for Blood Sample. The officer then detained the accused by remaining with him while awaiting the Blood Kit to arrive and for a blood technician to take the blood. During this time, the officer interrogated the accused about the accident and the accused provided additional information. The Crown contended that if he was given the police warning then it would be clear to the accused that he did not have to continue to answer questions the officer's questions. The Defence argued that since the arrest and the blood demand were based upon self-incriminating evidence obtained by breach of the accused's s. 7 rights, the arrest was illegal and all evidence obtained thereafter should be excluded; or, at least, that the information obtained was illegally obtained and the police could not rely on that information to make the demand. The accused testified that he talked to the police officer only because he believed he had a legal obligation to do so, based on advice he had received from others that there was a legal obligation to report the accident promptly to the police. The Crown conceded that the accused did have a legal obligation to report the accident promptly, and that if the accused believed he was reporting the accident when he gave self-incriminating statements to the police officer as a result of that belief, those statements must be excluded according to law. HELD: All of the statements of the accused, including those made after the arrest, are excluded and will not form part of the Crown's case. The evidence obtained, and the statements, in particular, were self-incriminating and conscriptive. The officer was acting in good faith, not with serious intentional disregard of the accused's rights. He was not taking a statement under the Traffic Safety Act. He did not know that the accused was only saying things because he believed he had to under compulsion of statute. Even though the investigator did nothing that violated the accused's rights, they were nevertheless violated. Because the violation resulted in the making of statements that amounted to self-incriminating evidence, following the logic of the case law, it is necessary to exclude those statements. The accused did approach the police officer with the intention of reporting the accident as is required by the Traffic Safety Act. As such, and as the Crown correctly concedes, his initial statement, anything said by the accused while providing his personal information and the answer to any question while registering at the hospital are excluded from this trial. As the self-incriminating statements made under compulsion of statute have been excluded, it follows that any evidence that came about as a result of the officer following up on those excluded statements are also in breach of the accused's s. 7 rights.","The accused was charged with impaired operation, driving over.08 and breach of his section 7 rights. The voir dire resulted in the admissibility of statements made by the accused to a police officer. The accused made self-incriminating statements to the officer as a result of his belief that he was reporting the accident promptly. The officer concluded that the accused understood his rights, the warning and demand for the blood sample and was'relatively co-operative throughout'. However, he had no recollection of the officer ever placing him under arrest, giving him the warning or making the blood demand. The evidence must only be excluded based upon the factors expressed in R. v. Collins, [1987] SCC, 113 C.C.C.(3d) 321. The Crown conceded the accused had a legal obligation to report the accident, and if the accused believed he was Reporting the Accident when he gave self- incriminating statements, such statements would be excluded in order to ensure the accused has a fair trial. The fair trial test tends more towards an absolute rule of exclusion because courts are instructed not to concentrate on the motives behind the Charter violations. The case before us, the self- referencing statements that were made under compulsion of statute have been excluded. The police officer abandoned his previous investigation and accompanied the accused by remaining with him while awaiting the Blood Kit to arrive and for a blood technician to take the blood. During this time, the accused was also awaiting treatment for his injuries. HELD: The evidence received by the officer was as the result of a breach of the accused's s.7 rights and must be excluded pursuant to s.24(2) of the Charter. 1) The accused's statements were made in good faith. He did not know that he had a right to make these statements because he believed he had to under-curtain of statute. He was interrogating the accused after he had arrested him, explained what he was arrested for, explained to him his rights to counsel and further warned him he was not obligated to say anything further to the police. However, his recollection of being placed under arrest and given a warning were not made with the intent of making the demand. 2) The self- incriminating Statements were made over a period of time and were not admissiblinating. The statements in particular were self-injurious and conscriptive. The admission of guilt and the admission of liability for wrongful conduct by the police in connection to the wrongful conduct of an accused will generally be"
7_2018skca42.txt,"Criminal Law – Murder – Second Degree Murder – Conviction – AppealEvidence – Unsavoury Witnesses – Vetrovec Warning – Charge to Jury The appellant had been found guilty of second degree murder following a trial before a judge and jury. He appealed on the ground that the trial judge had failed to give the jury a Vetrovec warning regarding the testimony of his former common law spouse (S.S.) and a witness who had been his friend (W.D.) who was the source of the gun used in the shooting of the victim. The appellant’s trial counsel had initially identified the need for the judge to issue the warning because W.D. had an interest in the outcome because there were outstanding charges against him and because there was the potential that S.S.would be charged too, she would also have an interest in the case as well. During the pre-charge conference with defence counsel and the Crown, the trial judge noted that in giving the warning to the jury he would also have to convey a summary of the Crown’s confirmatory evidence. The defence counsel then withdrew his application. The victim had been a friend of the appellant. According to S.S.’s testimony, the appellant and the victim had pre-arranged a meeting in an abandoned farmyard. The victim worked as an automated teller machine (ATM) technician and as part of his job, he travelled between ATMs carrying cash. S.S. did not see what happened between the two men but heard two gunshots and then saw the appellant and the victim point guns at each other. She saw the victim on his knees pleading with the appellant and offering money in exchange for his life. The appellant instructed her to collect the money and the victim’s cellphone and place them in his truck and while she was doing so, she heard another gunshot and saw the victim lying face down and the appellant standing over him holding a gun. As she and the appellant left the scene, the appellant gave her the victim’s gun. The appellant hid the other guns and the money at another farm site and then dumped the victim’s cellphone and ammunition in a farm field. Apart from the handguns, none of the other items were ever recovered. The witness remained in a relationship with the appellant for another four years following the crime until November 2013. She was contacted by the police in February 2013 and denied any knowledge of the incident. At trial, S.S. testified that she was afraid of the appellant and he had warned her that as an accomplice, she was as involved as he was. When the RCMP contacted her again in May 2014, she again denied any knowledge but then told the officer what she knew because she felt safer and would receive protection from the appellant. S.S. did not have a criminal record, nor was she charged with any offence arising from this incident. The appellant testified that during the meeting in the farmyard, the victim produced two handguns and they began to test fire the weapons. The victim suggested that they stage a fake robbery. The appellant would rough up his friend and then take the cash from his truck. The victim became quite aggressive after the appellant hit him too hard and began chasing him with one of his guns. S.S. then took one of the guns and shot the victim three times. She took $23,000 in cash from his truck because she had financial problems. The testimony of W.D. was that the appellant had acquired two handguns, a Glock and a .22 calibre handgun, from him, ostensibly on behalf of another friend. Several days later, the appellant returned both handguns and reported that after his friend began to shoot at him with the .22 calibre, he had returned fired and shot him three times. On the appellant’s insistence, the witness changed the barrel of the Glock handgun several months later. The police arrested W.D. and charged him with unspecified offences arising from the incident. In the appellant’s version, he testified that the victim brought the guns to the meeting and assumed that he acquired them from W.D. He therefore returned them to W.D. after the incident and requested that he change the barrel on the Glock to protect W.D. HELD: The appeal was dismissed. The court found that the trial judge had not erred by not giving the Vetrovec warning. It was not mandatory for him to do so regardless of the position of the defence counsel. The judge was aware of the need for such a warning in the circumstances and after consulting with the Crown and the defence, he exercised his discretion to decide that he would not instruct the jury. The judge was aware that the defence counsel withdrew his application as a tactical decision to avoid having the judge repeat the Crown’s confirmatory evidence to the jury. The judge’s exercise of his discretion was entitled to deference.","HELD: The appeal was dismissed. The court found that the trial judge did not give a Vetrovec warning to either witness. It was not an error of law on the part of the defendant. The trial judge was alive to the jurisprudence in raising the issue of whether a witness's testimony should be given to the jury in relation to the testimony of two witnesses. The defendant took the position that the fatal bullet had entered the plaintiff's head, striking the bottom of his right occipital bone and exiting above his right eye. The evidence in this case was that the defendant had asked the plaintiff to change the barrel of the handgun. The plaintiff had received $500 of the stolen money from a friend of the friend who had killed Mr. Byer, who had been employed as an automated teller machine (ATM) technician. He had been charged with the murder of his friend, who was killed in an isolated, abandoned farmyard in 2010. He retained different legal counsel for his appeal. The appellate counsel abandoned the ineffective counsel ground and proceeded solely with the argument that a trial judge erred in law by failing to give the defendant a proper dose of warning. The appeal court also held that there was a risk that the evidence in tandem with the evidence might impair the credibility of the Crown witness who sought to avoid prosecution or incarceration by testifying for the Crown."
b_2004skqb105.txt,"FIAT: The defendant applied for security for costs in the amount of $50,000. HELD: The plaintiff was required to supply security for costs in the amount of $18,000. 1) The defendant proved facts, which demonstrated the existence of several of the criteria listed in Rule 538 of the Queen's Bench Rules of Court. The plaintiff failed to establish any of the situations listed in Rule 539.  2) The presence of a counterclaim does not necessarily or automatically prohibit the granting of an order for security for costs. Rather, it is a factor to be considered. In this case, the counterclaim was not a wholly distinct claim. It arises in respect of the same matter and transaction as the claim proper. 3) The defendant commenced the builders' lien action, long before filing a defence and counterclaim within this action. Had the counterclaim not been filed, an order for security for costs as requested would have been appropriate. It is somewhat artificial to now deny that relief because of the counterclaim, which has the effect of facilitating a disposition of all matters within one proceeding. 4) The plaintiff applied ex parte under s. 56(1) of The Builders' Lien Act to have the defendant's lien vacated. The application was granted, but the plaintiff was required to post security for costs in the amount of $50,000. The Builders' Lien Act does not impede the jurisdiction of this Court to deal with the application of the defendant.","FIAT. The defendant applied to the court for an order requiring the plaintiff to provide security for costs in the amount of $50,000. The application was granted but the plaintiff was required to pay $20,000 for expert costs. The plaintiff counterclaimed for $25,000 and the counterclaim was dismissed. HELD: The court has discretion. It does not allow a counterclaim to be filed and, in the circumstances, it would not have an adverse effect on the plaintiff's ability to defend against it if the security was restricted to costs for the defence of the claim proper. In the present case, the plaintiff commenced the builders' lien action long before filing a defence and counterclaim within this action. It is reasonable to expect that the defendant will eventually decide to vacate the action and the costs which should be paid will be in the cause.  1) The plaintiff applied ex parte under s. 56(1) of The Builders' Lien Act (supra) to have the defendant's lien vacated and it was now argued that the court has no jurisdiction to do anything more. 2) In this case the defendant commenced another separate and distinct action (Q.B. 1438/99), which was the other action. That was the result of a statutory regime but it is unlikely anything more would be ordered as it may adversely effect the plaintiff’s opportunity to defend the action. 3) The presence of the counter claim in this case does not preclude an order for security for cost. 4) In the alternative, the defendant has asked for a declaration that PricewaterhouseCoopers is liable for any award of costs that may be made against the plaintiff. 5) The court reviewed the pleadings and the material filed. It was not seen as an absolute prohibition but rather a factor to be considered."

The terms of the settlement and the sum paid were not to be disclosed. Beyond the issue of privilege which was a complete answer to the request, revisiting that action was a more critical problem. The sum paid to settle the first action was not allocated to any head of damages so those issues would have to be transversed as well. 2)The applicant may introduce his prior medical records with respect to the 1985 accident subject to compliance with the usual rules as to notice and admissibility. 3)The statement of claim in that action could not be entered at this trial as it was not evidence.

There were numerous adverse impacts on the victim. 2)Mitigating circumstances included the absence of a criminal record; his abstinence from alcohol since the assault; the absence of penile penetration; his remorse and apology to the victim and to the court; his serious health problems; his ability to rehabilitate and the fact that he was a model citizen prior to the assault.","The accused was convicted of sexual assault. The Crown sought a sentence of 1/2 to years for the offence, categorizes it as rape, and alleges there was no prior romantic connection between the victim and the accused, and that she pleaded with him not to do this. The property damage and vandalism had no connection to the case. HELD: A lower sentence was justified. A sentence of 18 months in a provincial correctional centre would seriously affect the accused's ability to rehabilitate. A three year threshold sentence was to be increased or decreased from the three year term based on the circumstances of the individual case. The accused was prohibited from having any fire arms, ammunition or explosive substances for a period of ten years from his release from prison. The fire arms were prohibited from being used for a ten year period. The sentences were to be served concurrently.  1)Having imposed a custodial sentence of less than 2 years, I must now deal with s.742.1 of the Criminal Code which permits the court to allow the accused to serve his term in the community.

The only ground of appeal relates to the failure of the Provincial Court judge to advise the appellant of his rights to be tried in French or English pursuant to Section 530(3). The appellant's mother tongue is French and the fact that the trial judge did not advise him of his Rights to Trial in his own language is a procedural error. Ordering a new trial is ordered."

(1) that the plaintiff met the three requirements to prove an unjust enrichment by virtue of the plaintiff's contributions of time and money, namely (a) an enrichment, (b) a corresponding deprivation, and (c) the absence of any juristic reason for the enrichment. The proper remedy was an award of monetary damages representing 25% of the increase in the value of the defendant's assets during the relationship, not the imposition of a constructive trust; and (2) jointly held properties were to be sold pursuant to the Partition Act, unless the plaintiff elected to buy out the defendant's one half interest within 30 days.

For the past four years, she paid all of the household expenses with the exception of the mortgage on the property held jointly with the plaintiff. During this time, the parties resided in a mobile home owned and occupied by the plaintiff and her three children from a prior marriage. For four years between 1975 and 1988, the plaintiff was responsible for the household duties and the care of the children. In 1989, the defendant purchased a piece of property in their joint names and it was still in their names. The value of the property at the time of separation was $664,900 and the plaintiff's annual income was $7,000. The court found that the respondent's net worth was $804,000, excluding his interest in jointly held property and after acquired property, and there was no juristic reason for the enrichment. The respondent's evidence that he paid taxes in the amount of $20,000 per year directly assisted him in his business, and he held bank accounts and various term deposits and RRSPs worth $170,321, leaving him in a negative net worth situation.

The interest was to be paid to the joint account and on maturity, the beneficiary was entitled to the funds. The estate appealed.

Assessing non-pecuniary damages at $60,000. In assessing pecuniary damages, the court accepted the defendant's expert evidence which led to the conclusion the plaintiffs businesses were marginally profitable. The defendants were ordered to pay $30,000 as real, net loss of future income. The court approved a 5% capitalization rate as being appropriate where there was an eight year term to age 65. The plaintiff settled his future Section B benefits just before trial. The court rejected the defence argument that they were entitled to a credit for present value of those benefits which represented a figure over seven times the settlement figure. The defendants were only entitled to a credit for sums actually paid to the plaintiff. The court rejected the plaintiff's actuarial report as being late and in breach of Civil Procedure Rule 31.08.","The plaintiff was seriously injured in a motor vehicle accident. His automobile was struck from behind. He was not hospitalized, never required surgery, and was by all accounts completely and permanently disabled for any type of employment. The plaintiff pressed for trial during the term of the Supreme Court in Kentville. His injuries were so severe that he was unable to work any longer. For the past two years, he had been paying down his farm loan and other debts, and had sold some special veneer logs. He had also been unsuccessful in obtaining a loan for $140,000 to the Farm Loan Board. He now sought and was granted leave to present his injury report to the trial judge. The court accepted the plaintiff's assertion that the injuries were such that he could not comfortably project any improvement. It was not enough for the plaintiff to urge that leave be granted because defence counsel was sufficiently skilled, prepared and experienced to deal with its late introduction. There was a burden of persuasion upon the defaulting party to show that the interests of justice would merit its late reception.

c_1998canlii12367.txt,"The decision of the Board of Arbitration was held by the chambers judge to be fundamentally flawed in that the majority brushed aside basic grammatical conventions; had proceeded upon a bad principle of construction obviously weighted in favour of the grievance; had discarded the ordinary meaning of some words; and had violated the terms of the agreement precluding alteration of its provisions. She also held that one cannot ignore the phrase 'pursuant to Article 28 or 26', read it out of existence nor re-write it and that if the words were given their ordinary meaning the interpretation was patently unreasonable. HELD: The appeal was dismissed. 1)The trial judge did not err in concluding the majority decision of the Board of Arbitration was patently unreasonable. Its decision rested upon an interpretation of the collective bargaining agreement that the words of the agreement could not reasonably bear. 2)No material error was found in her analysis in finding that the decision was fundamentally flawed or in her analysis of the phrase 'pursuant to Article 28'. Nor in her identification or application of the governing standard of review. DISSENT: The appeal would have been allowed. 1)There was no dispute that the central issue, the reviewability of the board's interpretation, requires an application of the test prescribed by Shalansky. The Chambers judge did not follow that approach. Once it is accepted that there are two reasonable constructions, the suggestion of a reviewable error of law in consensual arbitration disappears. The decision can only be set aside if it involves an interpretation the words of the agreement could not reasonably bear. The patently unreasonable test is a very strict test. 2)The judge was wrong to use the Melford decision to support her conclusion that the Pool interpretation was the only one which the words of the collective agreement could reasonably bear. 3)Once the ordinary meaning of the words 'pursuant to' must be set aside by reason of their context in Article 16, the decision by an adjudicator to choose either 'for the purposes of' or 'subject to' is motivated more by the result desired rather than by fine legal principles of interpretation. Such policy decisions are better left to arbitrators in the field than to judges.","The Chambers judge was not convinced that the majority decision of the Board of Arbitration in the grievance of Lavern Chypiska was patently unreasonable. She noted at the beginning that she was not empowered to interfere unless it was 'patently unreasonable.' The resulting interpretation was not necessarily unreasonable. Allowing the appeal, that the appeal is dismissed. The Chambers judge's analysis of the majority's approach to the interpretation of the provisions in question was a perfectly rational one. It was not irrational for the Chambers judge to conclude that the phrase 'pursuant to' as the phrase is used in Article 16 does not mean 'according to' or 'consequent upon', or 'by reason of'. The reasonableness of the respondent's interpretation, which was not reasonable, was wiped out by the use of the phrase by the appellant."
5_2006skca7.txt,"This is an appeal brought by the R.M. from a judgment of the Court of Queen's Bench determining that a mortgage held by the R.M. was subordinate to a mortgage held by the respondent Farm Credit Canada (FCC), even though the R.M. mortgage was registered before the mortgage of FCC. The R.M. had agreed with the mortgagor that its mortgage would be subordinate to that of FCC. The appeal raises the application of the priority provisions of The Land Titles Act, 2000 and in particular the application of s. 54 of the Act. HELD: The mortgage of the respondent has priority over the mortgage of the appellant. The appeal is dismissed with costs.  1) It is not necessary in this case to consider whether the priority provisions of the Land Titles Act are overridden by commercial postponement agreements in mortgages, or whether reliance by the competing security holder is necessary in order to displace the doctrine of privity of contract in relation to a covenant to postpone, for the court consider the matter to be governed by a consideration of the nature of the interest created by the R.M. mortgage in light of s. 54(3) of the Act. 2) Registration does not and cannot alter the nature of the legal interest granted by the instrument registered. In the present case the mortgage instrument states that it is pursuant to the prior Grant Agreement executed by the parties. This agreement, in turn, clearly provides that any security granted by Mainline to the R.M. is subject to the prior security interest of the respondent to the extent of $3,125,000. In effect, Mainline granted to the R.M. a mortgage of a limited interest, being Mainline's equity of redemption after any mortgage held by the respondent, to the extent of $3,125,000. The appellant admits that it was never intended, as between itself and Mainline, that it would obtain a security interest in priority to that of the respondent. Mainline granted a mortgage to the appellant subject to the prior interests, as defined, of the respondent and of CIBC. The appellant is therefore, seeking to increase the interest actually accorded to it by the debtor by relying on its prior registration and the priority provision of the Act.","This is an appeal from a judgment of the Court of Queen's Bench determining that a mortgage held by the respondent was subordinate to that of the R.M. even though the mortgage was registered before the mortgage of the respondent. The appeal raises the application of the priority provisions of The Land Titles Act, 2000, S.S. 2000, and the Application of s.54 of the LTA. HELD: 1) The trial judge held that the respondent's fee simple mortgage had priority over the appellant's mortgage. The respondent had agreed to a postponement in favour of the applicant. 2) The second FCC Mortgage, which was drawn by its solicitors, was not drafted as a registrable mortgage but only purported to charge 'his equity' as required by the terms of the instrument. 3) Up to the time of the filing of the caveat the situation was that both the appellant and the respondent had equitable mortgages upon the land. In the instant case, the respondent did not even know about, and certainly did not rely upon, the covenant to postpone contained in the Grant Agreement between the respondent and the appellant. The third parties are not affected and the M. should not be permitted to have its interests advanced over those of the FCC by virtue only of prior registration. 4) The appeal was accordingly dismissed with costs to the respondent in the amount of $6,000."

The victim did not provide a victim impact statement, but the court concluded that the event would have been terrifying for him. The gravity of the offence was high given the maximum sentence of life imprisonment. The court found the following mitigating factors: 1) guilty pleas; 2) the event was not planned in advance, it was prompted by alcohol use; 3) the assault was serious but brief; 4) the accused were all employed and contributing members of society; 5) the accused all accepted responsibility for the offence; and 6) the accused all complied with strict release conditions for three years. The aggravating factors were: 1) s. 348.1 of the Criminal Code was applicable to all accused even though their level of participation differed; 2) they entered the victim’s residence by breaking a window; 3) the crime was intense; 3) two of three accused had weapons and used them on the victim; and 4) the victim had some lasting injuries from losing three to four teeth. The court was prepared to extend leniency to the accused; however, some period of incarceration was found necessary to meet the objectives of deterrence and denunciation. A.H. was sentenced to 10 months incarceration, J.M. to 11 months incarceration, and N.F. to 12 months less a day incarceration for the break and enter charge and one year consecutive incarceration on the s. 85(2) charge.

The victim of the assault was identified as Jesse Manulak, who was the resident of the dwelling house and the accused's step-father.

While Rule 59.60 doesn't provide guidance on when it would be appropriate to seal a file, Rule 85.04(1) does. The SCC decision of Dagenais (and related cases) applies. A confidentiality order should only be granted when: necessary to prevent a serious risk to an important interest; there are no less intrusive measures available; and the benefits outweigh the costs. Personal embarrassment or damage to a party's reputation isn't enough. Here, the important public interest is the protection of personal identifiers (e.g. SIN's, addresses, bank account numbers and other personal information required on court documents). Having these identifiers accessible to members of the public can result in identity theft, which is a real and serious concern. The court is able to take judicial notice of the fact society values the prevention of identity theft (and that it exists in the first place). There are no less intrusive measures to prevent access to this personal information that aren't cumbersome and costly for the parties and court administration staff. The salutary effects of a sealing order outweigh its deleterious effects, especially since the public will still be permitted to access the court hearing and any decision that is rendered.

b_2013skqb265.txt,"The appellant landlord appealed a decision of the Residential Tenancies hearing officer. The tenancy in question had commenced in April 2012. On September 18, the tenant had given six weeks' notice of her intention to terminate the tenancy. The term of the lease stated that it was for a term of 12 months (April 2012 to March 2013) and continuing thereafter from month to month until one of the parties gave one month's notice. The appellant did not try to rent the premises following receipt of the notice because he had decided to furnish the unit prior to re-renting. He spent $15,000 doing so and advertised the unit in mid-January, increasing the rent by $400 and obtained a new tenant as at February 1. Although it is not stated what relief the landlord sought from the Office of Residential Tenancies, the hearing officer stated in the decision that the lease was a month-to-month tenancy. The appellant argued that the hearing officer made errors in law in that he 1) misinterpreted s. 19(1)(g)(iii) of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 in making that finding, as the lease was for a fixed term; and 2) misinterpreted s. 8(2) of the Act in finding that the landlord's efforts at mitigation were not reasonable within the meaning of the section and the landlord was legally disentitled by s. 8(1) of the Act. HELD: The Court held that the hearing officer had erred in law in finding that the lease was for a month-to-month tenancy. The one-month-notice provision only applied if the tenancy was extended beyond the fixed term. The appeal was allowed on this issue. The Court found that the decision of the landlord to furnish the premises was a business decision, and the result of this decision could not be attributed to the tenant. The Court dismissed the appellant's claim for loss.","The appellant landlord appealed a decision of the Residential Tenancies Hearing Officer in finding that the tenancy agreement was not a fixed-term agreement and that the landlord is legally disentitled to compensation pursuant to s. 8(1) of the Act. HELD: The appeal is dismissed. 1) The wording of the lease indicates it is for a fixed term from April 1, 2012 to March 31, 2013 and may thereafter be continued on month to month. The fact that an indefinite term follows the fixed term of one year does not detract from the fact that the respondent was committed to the Fixed Term of One year at the time she gave notice to terminate the lease on September 18, 2012.  2) The fact a month-to-month tenancy would follow the primary fixed term negated a Fixed Term. The decision to not advertise the unit for rent was a macro decision based on his business going forward. None of the macro decisions can be attributed to the respondent. To put the matter in perspective, if the appellant had not chosen to make the change to furnished premises and had simply waited until November to start advertising the suite for rent, and had then waited until January to re-rent the unit, he would not have been able to prove entitlement to rent revenue loss. 3) The hearing officer misinterpreted ss. 19(1)(g)(iii) of The residential Tenancies Act, 2006 in finding the tenancy was not for fixed term. He concluded the tenant had not complained to the landlord about the noise was failure to mitigate and that he had done what was reasonable to minimize his loss. The appellant did not attempt to rent the premises following his receipt of the notice, because he spent approximately $15,000 on furnishing the unit prior to realizing he had decided to furnish the unit. This decision was appropriate on the facts of the case he was considering. The question in this matter for the hearing officer was would there be any loss if there was a loss, if it was done minimally, and accordingly if the tenant is entitled to compensation."

The accused, a status Indian with Aboriginal and Treaty 10 rights, was fishing for food. He had used a net in the restricted area and had caught eight suckers, two walleye and one northern pike. The Bay was very close to the residence of the accused on the Canoe Lake First Nation and was his preferred area to fish. The remainder of Canoe Lake was subject to restrictions governing all fishing but open to unlimited Treaty sustenance fishing all year round. The accused admitted to the actus reus of the offence. Under the Constitutional Questions Act, 2012 the accused gave notice that he would argue that s. 7(2)(b) of the regulations was invalid because it restricted his Treaty and Aboriginal right to fish food in the restricted area as defined by the Regulations; infringed his Treaty and Aboriginal right to fish for food as protected by s. 35(1) of the Constitution Act, 1982; and infringed his Treaty and Aboriginal right to fish for food as protected by s. 25 of the Charter of Rights. The agreed Statement of Facts confirmed the accused’s Aboriginal Treaty status and right to sustenance fishing. The Crown’s major witness was an expert in fish biology and he testified that the restricted area had been closed to protect it for walleye spawning. He stated that the closed area could not be opened for sustenance fishing. The conservation effort had been supported by the Canoe Lake Band Council./n HELD: The accused was found guilty. The court found that the accused had failed to show a breach of his Treaty fishing right that would raise a defence or a Charter remedy to the charge against him: 1) the challenged regulations were within the implied common law limitations on Aboriginal fishing rights; 2) alternatively, the regulations fell within the provisions that permitted such regulations in Treaty 10; 3) alternatively, if they were not within the implied limitations of the right, the evidence had not established a prima facie infringement of the right; 4) alternatively, if there was a breach, it met the justification principles set out in Sparrow and Pierone.","The accused was charged with angling for or for the purposes of breaching his Treaty right to fish for sustenance in accordance with s. 7(2)(b) of the Saskatchewan Fishery Regulations, 1995. The issue before the Court was whether the accused was bound by s.7 of the Regulations, made pursuant to the Fisheries Act, 1995, and whether the regulation violated his Treaty rights. HELD: The accused was granted a stay of the charge. The Court found that the evidence showed that the accused admitted to the actus reus of the substantial charge but put forth as defence his rights to fish in any water and at any time he so chooses. The evidence also showed that there was a significant difference between the words 'all fishing' and 'all feeding'. The Court ordered the closure of the commercial fishing co-op to be maintained and a reduction to the 5,000-kilogram quota for commercial and recreational fishing to apply only to commercial fishing and not to Treaty sustenance fishing rights."

The Court admitted a letter into evidence in which the accused attempts to induce a potential witness to fabricate an alibi for him. HELD: Accused found guilty. The accused was correctly identified. The Court drew an adverse inference against the accused by his attempt to induce a potential witness to fabricate an alibi by. The Court was convinced beyond a reasonable doubt that the accused's purpose in writing the letter was not to insure himself against the prospect of wrongful conviction, but to induce perjured evidence for his benefit in order to discredit the identification evidence adduced at the preliminary inquiry. The letter is direct evidence of where the accused was not at the time of the robbery and is corroboration for the identification evidence of the Crown witness.",The accused was charged with armed robbery. The accused asserted that he was not at the club at the time of the robbery but that his girlfriend was there. HELD: The accused was found guilty. 1)The letter was an attempt to induce a potential witness to fabricate an alibi by perjury. 2)The accused expressly said in his letter that he wished to be found out where the person who identified him from was from. 3)The evidence drawn against the accused was that he did not meet the accused's definition of 'person' as provided in the photo ID line-up provided by the police. 4)The allegation that the accused fabricated the evidence was not supported by the evidence at trial nor by the evidentiary value of the whole letter.
5_2002skqb213.txt,"FIAT. The issue in this application to vary spousal support was whether there had been a material change in either the husband's or wife's employment status, financial means or needs, warranting an increase in spousal support since their 1999 interspousal contract. The wife requested a 50% increase based on the husband's income increase of 50%. She suffered from MS and was unable to work. HELD: Spousal support was varied to $3,500 monthly. The only material change in the wife's means and needs is that fact she is residing with a new partner who resides in her home in exchange for yard work and housework. Although he worked, he made no apparent financial contribution to the household. The wife was awarded costs fixed at $1,000.","FIAT. The issue was whether there has been a material change in circumstances by virtue of a change in either the husband's or wife's employment status, or financial means or needs, warranting an increase in spousal support. The husband's position was summarized in his affidavit as follows: a 36% interest in trucking company called 'Titan Transport Ltd.' HELD: An increase was warranted, but not to the extent claimed by the wife. Spousal and support will be varied to $3,500 per month and continuing on the first day of each month thereafter until further order. The wife will have costs fixed in the amount of $1,000. 1)The company's retained earnings, year by year, were $2,450 for 1997, $115,000 for 1998 and $600 for 1999. The company's earnings in 2001 were $67,050. His equivalent income was $122,488 (salary $92,088, working bonus $30,400). 2)The wife was residing with a new partner. Their arrangement essentially allows him to reside in her home at no cost in exchange for his performing yard work and housework. The income tax is paid on the monies and loaned back to the company to keep our cash flow up as per bank. The benefits inherent in a shared living arrangement are not adequately or reasonably accounted for in the wife's presentation. She has requested a 50% increase in support because her expenses for the same year are halved due to the shared cost of living, if those shared costs were reasonably accounted, and an increase is warranted."
e_2000nsca53.txt,"The appellant and respondent lived together in common law relationship for approximately ten years. Two children were born of the relationship; the parties owned home as well as other assets. They separated in 1995. The appellant brought an application under s. 275 of the Matrimonial Property Act seeking an equal division of assets. She also sought a declaration that the Charter is infringed by the definition of spouse in s. 2(g) of the Act, because it does not include or recognize her common law relationship. The Chambers judge dismissed the application. He found that marital status is not an analogous ground upon which to base claim of discrimination under s. 15(1) of the Charter; or, in the alternative, that s. 2(g) does not constitute discrimination under s. 15(1) of the Charter; or, in the further alternative, that if s. 2(g) is discriminatory, it is saved by s. of the Charter. Allowing the appeal, that marital status is an analogous ground, and that s. 2(g) is discriminatory under s. 15 of the Charter because it denies a person in a common law relationship benefits which are granted to a similar person in a marriage relationship. The Crown did not discharge its onus of proving that the discrimination is demonstrably justified in a free and democratic society. The court rejected the appellant's submission that common law should be read in to the Act, and instead declared s. 2(g) to be unconstitutional and of no force and effect. This declaration was suspended for 12 months to enable the legislature to devise new criteria for eligibility under the Act that do not infringe s. 15(1) of the Charter.","The appellant and the respondent, while not married, lived together in a 'common law relationship' for approximately ten years. Two children were born out of this relationship. The respondent separated in 1995. The appellant commenced an application under the Matrimonial Property Act seeking an equal division of the parties' assets. In conjunction with that application, the appellant sought a declaration that the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms is infringed by the definition of'spouse' in s. 2(g) of the MPA. The MPA does not apply to the appellant and respondent because they do not come within the definition in the Family Maintenance Act. Both before and after the adoption of the Married Women's Property Act (MFPA), the husband remained under an obligation to support his wife, an obligation which was in principle lifelong. For several decades after its adoption, separate property worked reasonably well in large majority of cases. However, it was not always possible for the appellant to obtain a support order against her former partner on the breakdown of their same sex relationship. In the end, the respondent separated from the appellant. She successfully applied for a declaration under the MFPA that she had no right to any share of it on a marriage breakdown. Application dismissed; the applicant's claim for differential treatment was not based on a substantive difference in status but on a multiplicity of substantive and substantive differences between the parties. Both parties were entitled to equitable treatment."
c_2009skqb433.txt,"The Ministry seeks an order under s. 37(2) which is a permanent committal and is a precursor to the boys Michael and David being placed for adoption. Art and Laura, the maternal grandparents oppose the application and want the boys returned to their care. The mother, Melody, supported her parent's application for custody. HELD: The boys are in need of protection and there is an order placing the boys in the permanent care of the Minister. As long as the boys are in foster care, the Ministry will make arrangements for the boys to have regular access to their mother and to Art and Laura.  1) There is no doubt but that Art and Laura love and wish the best for the boys. However, there are real concerns about Art and Laura' familial context. There is the fact that Art and Laura's own children were apprehended in 1989 and committed to the Minister. It is pertinent to note Art and Laura are estranged from four of their six children.  Two of Art's children claim he sexually assaulted them. When Melody testified she said her first preference was that the boys be placed with Mary Stevens, their foster parent, but did acknowledge that the boys would be in good hands with Art and Laura. 2) While the Court accepts that the Stevens home is a positive and nurturing one, there is no question it is not an ideal physical place for 9 people. With organization, routine and discipline however, it can function at a satisfactory level. Further, if an order is made under s. 37(2), the boys have the opportunity to be adopted. The Court cannot lightly preclude that possibility.","The Ministry of Social Services sought an order under s. 37(2) which is a permanent committal and is a precursor to the boys being placed for adoption. The boys had special needs and were developmentally delayed. Their mother opposed the application and petitioned the Court to return the grandsons to their care, alleging that they were being sexually assaulted by their maternal grandparents. The mother, who was receiving Social Assistance, sought custody of the boys. HELD: The children were placed with the Minister until the age of 18. 1) The Court was satisfied that the boys were in need of protection and concluded that the Stevens home met the necessary physical requirements to properly care for the children. The Court ordered a permanent order placing the children with the Ministry. 2) The Children and Family Services Act set out clear objectives. The 1987 conviction was not the last brush with the law. The children have special needs of some sort, even high needs. The physical plant of the home must present some challenges. However, the Court was of the view that an adoption plan was unlikely due to reasons such as the age at which the child was born or other circumstances. There was also a risk that one of the children may be sexually assaulted. The evidence showed that the accused, who had a somewhat complex familial background, had a number of partners. He did not know he was the father of one child until approximately three years ago. 3) The boys were apprehended from the care of their paternal grandparents, A.H. (Art) and Laura (who were living with their mother). The Family Services worker responsible for the Ministry's social services (who was paying for the boys' care at the time of the offence) had contact in the east who was in the modelling business. If that contact actually employed one of Art's children, then he would receive a $1,000 finder's fee at least once. The business ended in 1999. The father was paying child support and the children's school fees when they were in their early thirties. The family continued to reside in the home until they graduated high school and moved to the therapeutic foster home in 2007. It was clear that the home had a laissez-faire attitude and that it was important that the children be placed with their parents who were able to provide for their needs."
c_2011skqb478.txt,"The accused was found guilty of possession of cocaine for the purpose of trafficking and possession of marijuana for the purpose of trafficking contrary to s. 5(3)(a) the Controlled Drugs and Substances Act, and having in his possession cash (almost $30,000) knowing it was obtained through the commission of an offence contrary to s. 354 and 355(a) of the Criminal Code. At issue was the accused's sentence. The Crown sought a global sentence of 5 years plus a forfeiture order of items seized, a fine in lieu of forfeiture for all cash used for legal fees, a mandatory weapons prohibition and sought bodily substances for DNA analysis. As the accused had been denied bail and had pre- trial detention of 15 months and 24 days, the defence sought one and one-half times credit for time served on remand.HELD: The accused had 9 prior drug convictions since 1999, two for trafficking in 2000 for which he received a 12 month sentence of incarceration and, in 2007, one trafficking and conspiracy to traffic which resulted in his receiving a 5 year penitentiary sentence. As the accused had been a compliant prisoner on remand, the Court granted him credit for 1.5 days for each day spent on remand for a total of 23 months and 21 days credit. The Court imposed a sentence of 30 months imprisonment, and ordered a DNA sample as well as a fine in lieu of forfeiture in the sum of $16,326 (being the sum transferred to the accused's legal counsel to pay his legal fees) to be paid within 60 days and, in default of payment, a term of imprisonment of 6 months consecutive to the term of imprisonment otherwise imposed.","The accused was found guilty of three counts contained in an amended Indictment dated December 12, 2011, charging him with the following offences: 1) the amount of cocaine found in the accused's possession was admittedly for the purpose of trafficking; 2) he was a compliant prisoner, had no disciplinary issues or problems while on remand and he would have qualified, had he been in the regular prison population, for a one-third reduction in his sentence for the offences for which he was being found guilty; and 3) there were six persons present in the trailer when the accused was arrested, there was no evidence that the drugs which were found were received from the accused. The accused has a serious prior conviction record for drug trafficking and conspiracy to do so as well as a number of drug possession charges. There is no evidence he has dealt effectively or perhaps at all with his drug addictions or dependancies. The facts do not show a sophisticated commercial enterprise that would warrant an extremely lengthy period of incarceration. The Court considered that the circumstances justify the maximum credit allowed pursuant to s. 719(3.1) of the Code."
3_2004skqb379.txt,"FIAT: The issues to be determined on this application are custody, child support and cancellation of the arrears of child support. HELD: 1) On the issue of custody, the mere passage of time, in this instance 9 years, would constitute a material change in circumstances relevant to custody. The child is now 15 years old. The parties are not candidates for joint custody and shared parenting. The child's view of the dysfunctional relationship between her parents compels this Court to preserve the status quo as being in the child's best interests. The petitioner will continue as the sole custodian.  2) The access was varied in January 2004. Nothing has changed to warrant a variation. 3) There was no evidence to support the respondent's statement that the child is living with him half the time. There was no evidence or explanation as to why he has failed to pay child support, which creates the present arrears. The evidence with respect to the respondent's finances was unsworn and out of date. In oral argument, the respondent asserted that he contributed to his daughter's care and that he is contributing to her education trust fund. If these expenditures were in fact made over and above his own cost of living, the Court would be compelled to accept the fact that he has financial resources available to him other that the $9,940 of social assistance which is disclosed in his tax return and financial statement. 4) The essence of the respondent's application for variation of the child support is based on his claim that his health has precluded him from working. The respondent's doctor was examined and, based on that medical evidence, the Court could not conclude that the respondent's generalized anxiety and depression disorder is beyond his control. The evidence was that the respondent could choose to help himself by eliminating alcohol and marijuana use. The respondent failed to meet the burden of proof by demonstrating that his depression and anxiety disorder was the consequence of factors beyond his control and thus preventing him from working and having an income with which to pay his child support obligations during the period under review. The application for variation of child support and cancellation of child support arrears is dismissed with costs.","FIAT. The respondent applied to vary the support and access provisions of the May 2, 1995 judgment. The 1995 judgment provided for the divorce of the petitioner and distribution of matrimonial property estate to the couple as well as custody, access and support for the child of the marriage. At issue was whether there should be a variation of the custody order. HELD: The application was dismissed. 1)The respondent was, as of August 2003, 10 months in arrears of child support. 2)The mere passage of time would constitute a material change of circumstance relevant to custody. The fact that the respondent was 15 years old at the time of the 1995 judgment did not disqualify him from the application. 3)The present application is dismissed. There is no change to the material change in circumstances of custody. This is without prejudice to the respondent to bring an application to vary with respect to the same relief if supported by the appropriate financial disclosure and documentation. There are no costs awarded."

Although given an opportunity, the plaintiff failed to call expert evidence respecting the elements of negligence including the duty of care, standard of care, breach of the duty of care or causation. The solicitors were awarded one set of costs taxed on column 4.","Following the completion of the plaintiff's civil trial by judge and jury, counsel for the defendants presented a motion for non-suit pursuant to Queen's Bench Rule 278A.

HELD: The application is dismissed and the defendant is entitled to one set of costs only against the plaintiff, the same to be taxed pursuant to column unless any other provisions of the rules with respect to offers of settlement are applicable. 1) There is no expert evidence presented by the plaintiff to the jury to provide the jury with the competence to reach a conclusion on the second most fundamental issue of the case, which is whether the standard of care that is applicable in a professional negligence case is breached. 2) The calling of a legal expert to provide opinion evidence is not a matter of convenience or choice for the plaintiff. The jury has no evidence upon which they could possibly render a competent verdict upon the disparate facts relied upon by the plaintiffs in the evidence that she and her husband gave at the trial. 3) The plaintiff's claim and the evidence she did present at this trial dealt with the very complicated issue of whether the duty of care owed and the breach of that duty by the defendant lawyers in respect of the preparation for and conduct of plaintiff's trial in what is known as a prosecution for quasi-criminal statutory offence(s) (Ries Estate). The issues raised involve substantial legal expertise and judgment including knowledge of the legal rules of admissibility respecting the evidence of witnesses, the identification of legal issues likely to be raised at trial, the appropriate strategy to address those legal issues and the judgments and decisions taken in pursuit of that strategy all are complex and important professional judgments to be made by the trial lawyer.  4) The court was awarded its costs of the motion in the context of column V. The court recognized the importance of calling expert evidence at trial where the issue is a matter beyond the ordinary competence of a trier of fact to decide, in that case, the trial judge's responsibility to decide."
d_2007skpc27.txt,"The accused is charged with assault contrary to s. 266 of the Criminal Code. The Crown applies to admit into evidence oral statements made by the complainant to her neighbor and to the police for consideration of the truth of their contents. HELD: The statements made by the complainant are found to be reliable and are therefore admissible.  1) Hearsay statement may be admitted on a principled basis, the governing principles are reliability and necessity. A number of cases have held that necessity is met when a witness recants or in some other fashion effectively holds hostage evidence that cannot be obtained from another source. 2) There is no other way to obtain the complainant's evidence. Whether her alcohol consumption that night erased her recollection of events or whether she is a hostile witness is immaterial at this stage. Either way she effectively holds hostage that evidence and the court need not determine the reason for the purpose of this application. The test of necessity has been met.  3) With regard to reliability, the question becomes whether there are sufficient indicia of reliability in a particular case to substitute the lack of oath, lack of cross-examination and absence of video taping. Where the hearsay statement was made in circumstances which provide some guarantees of trustworthiness, the test for reliability will be met. The following circumstances are evidence of trustworthiness: the complainant arrived unexpectedly at her neighbor's apartment, she was upset and crying, she asked that police be called, she spontaneously described the assault, she repeated a consistent version to the police, she had fresh red marks which corresponded with her description of the assault and the accused verified aspects of her complaint with comments he made.","The accused was charged with assault contrary to s. 266. The Crown applied to have the initial statements made by the complainant admitted into evidence for the truth of their contents as an exception to the rule which excludes hearsay evidence. Evidence was then called on voir dire. HELD: The Crown's application was granted on the basis of the res gestae exception. Where the hearsay statement was made in circumstances which provide some guarantees of trustworthiness, the test for reliability will be met.  1) The complainant's evidence is important to the Crown's case and there is no other means of obtaining that evidence. Whether her alcohol consumption that night erased her recollection of events or whether she is a hostile witness is immaterial at this stage. The statements were made contemporaneously and spontaneously to a friend without any apparent guile.  2) The Court found that the test of necessity has been met. The law is evolving and it is not only in situations where statements are recorded on video and taken under oath that there might be sufficient indicia of reliability. The test of reliability is met when a witness recants on an earlier statement. The earlier statement was necessary evidence because evidence of the same quality could not be obtained at trial. The fact that a witness is available at trial does not preclude the prior statement from being 'necessary'."

The journalists had no prior opportunity to hear its contents because Jones entered a guilty plea. The application was not opposed. The applicant sought an order for mandamus or a declaration. HELD: The presumption is in favour of public access to court records and the burden to contrary proof lies with the person who would deny access. This right is tempered by other factors (see R. v. SJS). Requiring the journalists to attend at the offices of the Attorney General and playing the CD ROM and making their own notes balances the interests of innocent parties whose conversations were recorded.","FIAT. Saskatoon's daily newspaper applied for access to a CD-ROM entered in evidence at a sentencing hearing. The accused entered a guilty plea and was not played for the sentencing judge. The applicant sought an order for mandamus, or a declaration. The Registrar of the Provincial Court advised the applicant it must apply to the appropriate court with notice to the Crown for an order to obtain access. Both counsel agree the exhibit is now under the control of the Attorney General and it is the appropriate respondent in this proceeding. HELD: The appropriate court to determine the issue of access is the Queen's Bench. The Attorney General does not oppose the application. It merely seeks the court order to release the CD-RROM to the applicant. The court is the proper court to obtain such relief.  1) The presumption in favour of public access and the burden to the contrary proof lies upon the person who would deny the exercise of the right. This right is tempered somewhat by other factors. As stated in R. v. S.J.S. at para. 8, the right to fair access has never been considered absolute. The governing principle is that there is a presumption in favor of publicaccess but that access must be supervised by the Court to ensure the integrity of the show is preserved and that no abuse or harm occurs to innocent parties. This comports with the hallmark of openness in our judicial system. 2) The applicant seeks an order under s. 7 of McIntyre v. Nova Scotia (Attorney General) 1982 CanLII 14 (SCC), [1982] S.C.R. 175 and Leader-Post v. Neuls (Q.B.). The presumption is in favour, favour, public access but that must be responsible for the establishment of a justice system that is free, fair and responsible for ensuring that all abuse and harm is not occurs to victims of natural or human trafficking. 3) The court of Queen’s Bench was the appropriate venue for the application as it was the venue of the sentencing hearing and would be able to hear the entire course of the conversation.  4) The respondent was granted regular business hours on his own premises and own leisure and was entitled to access."
b_2017skqb308.txt,"The Minister of Social Services applied for an order committing a two-year-old child to the care of his maternal grandparents for an indefinite period of time. The grandparents were previously designated as persons of sufficient interest. The child had lived with them since birth. The mother and father both suffered from addictions and had stopped living together by the time the child was born. The father had multiple criminal convictions, including drinking and driving offences and weapons offences. The mother’s relationship with her parents, family support worker and child protection worker during the course of the child’s life had been marked by volatility, argumentative behaviour and threats, one of which resulted in criminal harassment charges. The child was the subject of a protection order, which imposed conditions upon his parents. Neither meaningfully complied with the conditions set out in the protection order. Both parents testified at trial that their present circumstances were not suitable to raise a child. Each expressed intention to take steps necessary to provide a home for the child. Each parent asserted that a temporary order was appropriate. | HELD: The child was placed in the custody of his grandparents on an indefinite basis, which, while not temporary, was not as potentially immutable as a permanent order. That the child was in need of protection was not seriously challenged by either his mother or father. The prospect for change at the time of trial was limited to statements of good intentions. On their own, such statements were insufficient. There were opportunities for the parents to demonstrate a reasonable prospect for change. These opportunities were squandered and, in some cases abusively rejected by the mother.","HELD: The Court found that the parties were persons of sufficient interest pursuant to s. 23(1)(a) of The Child and Family Services Act (CFSA). The Ministry’s position that the petitioner remained a child in need of protection was not seriously challenged by either of the parties. With their current living circumstances, as well as the substance abuse and behavioural issues in both parents’ lives, the Court was satisfied that neither of them were able and willing to provide the minimum level of parenting required for C.T. to his needs. The Court also found that this failure was likely to cause physical and emotional harm to the child."

HELD: The Court granted judgment for damages in the amount of $3,822 for necessary repairs and $100 for cleaning expenses and granted the counter-claim in the amount of $580 for unpaid work performed by the defendant and then applied setoff. The Court allowed the cost of issuing the claim and for reasonable cost of service.","HELD: The plaintiffs claim their damages are set off against the claim of the plaintiffs.

The counterclaim against the defendant is reduced by 10% or $294.54. 2) In this case, the defendant's conduct constituted a breach of the contract and negligence, there is nothing to suggest it was malicious, oppressive or high-handed, such that punitive damages are rationally required to punish or deter. The objective of punitive damages is to punish the defendant rather than compensate plaintiff, whose just compensation will already have been assessed. This case was confined to exceptional cases where the defendant’s conduct was so malicious and oppressive as to warrant punishing or deterring the plaintiff. The doctrine of betterment precludes the plaintiffs from being fully compensated for a new countertop of greater value than the one which would have depreciated over time as the result of wear and tear.

The accused applied for an order pursuant to s.581(1) of the Criminal Code quashing count 1 on the grounds it offended the 'single transaction rule'; an order pursuant to ss.7 and 24(1) of the Charter and the common law doctrine of abuse of process that portions of the indictment as amended be quashed or stayed on the basis of the judgment in the trial of the former co-accused, Reginald Schafer; alternatively, an order staying the proceedings on the grounds of unreasonable delay in bringing the accused to trial. He argued the Crown would be in breach of an agreement in which he waived delay to proceed on the charges on which inconsistent findings could be made and would constitute bad faith. HELD: 1)The application to quash count 1 on the basis it charges more than one transaction was dismissed. The count particularizes in the alternative various ways in which the accused is alleged to have defrauded the investors of ICC by using funds of ICC to advance his or Schafer's interests. The case law cited by both parties clearly establishes that the word 'transaction' as used in s.581(1) is to be interpreted broadly and flexibly, and that a single transaction may, in this sense, include a number of acts or incidents occurring over a period of time. 2)Count 1 of the indictment was to be amended. The application to stay proceedings on the basis of findings made in the Schafer trial was allowed in relation to the particular charge in subpara.(b) of count 1 regarding use of ICC funds in the amount of $513,000 for Trirak along with subpara.(j) regarding alleged representations to ICC's investors that 30% of their investment would be invested in GICs. To allow the Crown to pursue these allegations would be an abuse of process. The Crown had indicated it would not proceed with subparagraphs (c) or (d). 2)There had not been unreasonable delay in light of the complexity of the charges, reasons for the delay, and the agreement by the applicant not to object to certain portions of delay.

The accused alleges that the Crown breached its agreement to allow the indictment to be quashed or stayed on the basis of the judgment of Klebuc J. in the trial of the former co-accused, who was re-elected to be tried by judge and jury.

The applicant argued that this application raised a question substantively different from that determined by Matheson J. but the Crown chose not to appeal those findings. HELD: 1) The Crown was not bound in this proceeding by any factual or legal determinations made by the trial judge in Schafer. 2) In some cases the Crown conceded that in relation to some of the matters which may appear to make findings favourable to the Leibel, but it was unable to determine from the indictment which of the original allegations the Crown was still pursuing against him in light of the Schafer judgment or whether it had now abandoned any of those matters.  3) The Court was satisfied that the application raised substantively the same question as that which it considered and determined adversely to the applicant first by trial judge Goldstein, then by judge Plemel and in the appeal of that decision."
b_2018skqb188.txt,"HELD: The accused were each acquitted of all charges. The court believed the evidence provided by the two accused and found that it was possible that the lease represented the actual arrangement between them and O.G. and that they believed that there only 400 plants in the greenhouses and they were part of a legal grow operation. The letter provided by O.G. purporting to change the address of his licences was found to have been forged by him. Regarding the possession for the purpose of trafficking, the court found that it was not satisfied on the evidence that either of the accused ever had personal possession or control of the marijuana plants nor that they had joint or constructive possession by virtue of some arrangement with O.G. The accused had explained that the cash seized by the police from their house had been received by them after they sold a trailer.","HELD: The Court held that an amendment to an information expanding the time particulars of the offence could be made at trial based upon evidence that indicates the offence may have been committed within the amended timeframe. Since the evidence was to the effect that marijuana plants did not start arriving until early June, grant amendment of the indictment to cover the period March 1, 2016 to September 15, 2016. The Court found that the Crown had proven beyond a reasonable doubt that: a) they were unlawfully producing cannabis; b) they possessed the cannabis for the purposes of trafficking; c) the currency in question was obtained by the commission in Canada of an offence punishable by indictment. HELD: 1) The evidence established that the accused were active participants in the marihuana grow operation and were in the possession for the purpose of trafficking. 2) Based on the totality of the evidence, the only rational conclusion to be drawn in respect of the cash found in their residence is that it was property obtained by a commission of an indictable offence in Canada. [2] The Crown challenged the veracity of the accused's evidence. Given their testimony, the application of the principles of W.(D), 1991 CanLII 93 (SCC), [1991] SCR 742) is a major element of this case. More detailed analysis of their evidence is required."

He sought a stay of proceedings in this action. Dismissing the appeal, that a declaration is not an 'order' under s. 813(a)(i) of the Code in that it does not bring a final end to the matter.

This is an appropriate situation to apply s.40 of the Family Property Act.

There was no extraordinary circumstance as provided in s.22(1), which would prevent equal division of the value of the family home.

When the project got into financial difficulty the defendant advised his client to seek separate counsel to deal with the creditors - suppliers. At a creditors meeting the defendant advised the creditors' counsel of the initial three letters of direction. The project was considered viable by the creditors and continued, with the defendant obtaining postponements of the three letters of direction. Further creditors' meetings were held, a Creditors' Committee struck, and subsequent letters of direction sent to the defendant by the client and certain creditors. The defendant, in acknowledging a subsequent letter of direction, made no mention of the earlier three letters, nor any explanation of 'all of the proceeds'. One member of the Committee was aware of the initial irrevocable letters of direction. On what was to be the final mortgage draw, the defendant requested and was refused a postponement of the initial three letters. With his client's consent, the defendant disbursed the funds, to pay off the initial three creditors, a mechanics' lien referred in one of the subsequent letters of direction, his legal fees and the balance as per a letter of direction received from two of three members of the Creditors' Committee.

Further, certain other plaintiffs were not aware of the letter, and could not have relied on it. Other plaintiffs did not supply after the letter and therefore did not rely on it. The Court noted that on a balance of probabilities, the defendant's disbursement did not cause the demise of the project. At the time of the disbursement the project was still viable and the plaintiffs made their own decision to cease supplying and to lien the project;  (2) there was no breach of trust as the defendant had no fiduciary duty and had at no time acted for the plaintiffs;  and  (3) there was no breach of undertaking as the undertaking must be considered in all the circumstances, including knowledge of the plaintiffs, the other letters and meetings.

The first mortgageee, the lawyer retained by the plaintiff, had disbursed funds contrary to the first letter of direction but that he was negligent in his written acknowledgement of the second letter and that he broke the undertaking contained in that acknowledgement.

The Gladue report was considered and the background of the accused was assessed as an enormous mitigating factor.

The Court of Appeal held that there is an elevated risk of flight in light of the fact that the applicant has exhausted all appeals in Romania and is facing a 3 year prison sentence. Canada's international obligations in extradition proceedings require the Court to look more severely at the risk of non-appearance than it would if the application was made solely under s. 679 in respect of criminal proceeding in Canada. The sureties offered by the applicant were not sufficient to ensure his attendance at Court. The application for judicial interim release was dismissed.","The respondent applies for judicial interim release pursuant to s. 20(b) of the Extradition Act so that he might serve a three-year prison sentence imposed as a result of his conviction, in that country, for criminally negligent homicide (an offence equivalent to that of manslaughter in Canada). Romania opposes the application. HELD: The application is dismissed. 1) The respondent has not established that he will surrender himself into custody were to release him. He is a Convention refugee. It is not my place to look behind that status on an application of this nature. There is an arguable basis for submitting to the Minister that he should not be surrendered to Romania. 2) On the basis of the committal order, the respondent's failure to abide by the terms of his community-based sentence and the fact that he has no real property and has identified no significant activities that connect him to the jurisdiction are fact. 3) While there is a risk of non-appearance in extradition proceedings, the Court finds that it would be non-sensical for the respondent to flee before the Minister's decision on his surrender to Romania, neither are they great. The respondent's application before the Court of Appeal is also dismissed. 4) In the context of review by the Minister under s. 679 of the Criminal Code, this means that the Court will not delve into the validity of the proceedings against the respondent and instead find that the respondent has met that onus on him. 5) In light of the conclusion that the appeal or application for leave to appeal is not frivolous, it is in the Court's favour that the appellant be released."

The Husband had not made an interim lump sum payment in the amount of $2,000.00 ordered in May and had undertaken to provide support monies after harvest. The Husband claimed that the value of the crop harvested was less than the farm expenses and resisted any change in the previous interim orders made. HELD: Application dismissed. The Court was not prepared to make the interim orders requested on the basis of the contradictory affidavits filed. A pre-trial was directed.","The applicant sought an interim distribution of matrimonial property and interim support for her two children and an order prohibiting the respondent from contacting her and from going to her workplace. An interim order granted the respondent exclusive possession of the parties' farm home with the exception of the tool shed and other parts of the farm yard which the husband was required to enter for the purpose of farming. Both parties were ordered to have no contact with the other and the respondent was ordered to pay $2,000 lump sum support for the children at the end of the 1994 harvest. HELD: The application was dismissed.  The court was not prepared to vary the order of May 27 and the extended order of October 19 which prevented the husband from approaching the home quarter. The evidence presented by the wife was simply her assertion that her husband has been earning money which enables him to pay periodic support. She also alleged the harvested crop had negative value."

The defendant alleged the First Nation was responsible for the administrator's conduct and applied to join the First Nation as a third party so that contribution or indemnity could be claimed. The applicant required leave under s.7 of the Contributory Negligence Act and Rule 107A(c) of the Rules of Court. HELD: Leave was granted to file a third party notice. 1)The low threshold for the establishment of a prima facie claim was met. 2)The delay would not be inordinate. The plaintiff's claim dated back to 1984. The parties were not ready for trial. No prejudice was established.  3)The third party's liability, if any, will have to be determined on a case by case basis. Each individual action brought by a former student at the residential school is different in nature. 4)The applicant was granted costs of the application against the plaintiff and the First Nation.","The applicant requires leave of this Court under s. 7 of The Contributory Negligence Act, R.S.S.; c. C-31, and Rule 107A(c) of the Rules of Court. The proposed third party applies to join the First Nation as a third party to the action brought by the plaintiff against it and Starr; so that it can claim contribution or indemnity from it — if the applicant is found liable to the plaintiff. The applicant alleges the applicant, the Attorney General of Canada, as the employer of Starr, was responsible for his conduct. The First Nation applies for join the G[…] First Nation so as to join it and be able to claim contribution and indemnity (should settlement not be reached at pre-trial, either party may take any further necessary steps that such party deems necessary to prepare for trial). The plaintiff's claim dates back to 1984; it can hardly be said any additional delay, due to third party proceedings, must necessarily result in dismissal of the application. Nor has the plaintiff established any prejudice. There is no indication that the inherent delay in allowing third party proceeding would result in the disappearance of any evidence, or that extra costs will be incurred by plaintiff in redoing steps already completed or that the process will become so cumbersome and complicated as to undermine the plaintiff's Claim. HELD: The application for an order granting the applicant leave to file aThird party notice in the within action was granted. Application to be granted against the applicant and the third party were granted. The court was of the view there must be some material by which a prima facie claim is shown, the first party claim and the pleadings on file could well be sufficient for this purpose. To attain uniformity it seems reasonable on an application for leave under s7, to encourage the joinder of third parties thereby averting duplication in law suits, and to minimize delay and prejudice to the applicant by appropriate directions rather than refusal of leave. The pleadings and proposed pleadings must be taken at face value; there is no evidentiary requirement to establish that they are correct. The third party's liability will have to be determined on a case by case basis."
d_1999skqb276.txt,"FIAT. The plaintiff applied for summary judgment in his claim for dismissal without just cause. The plaintiff was initially hired as body shop foreman but additionally acquired the title of assistant manager. When the body shop manager became ill that work load also fell to the plaintiff. It was during this period that the performance of the plaintiff, described by the defendant as serious misconduct, resulted in his termination. There was no issue of a lack of mitigation as the plaintiff accepted a job with another autobody shop but at a much lower rate of pay. The action was brought pursuant to the simplified procedure outlined in Part 40 of the Rules of Court. HELD: Damages were to be calculated by the parties for the 7 month notice period based on his income and value of benefits over the previous year, less the 6 weeks pay received, and less wages and benefits received from his new employment. Jurisdiction was reserved to hear further evidence should the parties not reach agreement. 1)By using the words 'shall grant judgment unless', Rule 488 requires the presiding judge to grant judgment except in the circumstances outlined in s.488(a)and(b). The test is not whether there is contradictory evidence in the affidavits but whether despite the contradictory evidence the issue(s) can be decided in the absence of cross-examination and it would be otherwise unjust to do so. If the court can assume the defendant's evidence is true and still grant summary judgment there is no genuine need for a trial. 2)As noted in numerous decisions, whether an employer is justified in summarily dismissing an employee is ultimately a question of fact. The plaintiff was not terminated because of poor job performance in performing his contractual duties as foreman and manager but because of his alleged poor performance in doing the job normally assigned to two persons. The employer has the right to expect that employees will not disparage their immediate supervisors or other employees in the course of their employment and certainly not to clients or customers of the employer. The type of conduct here would not justify dismissal the first time it came to the employer's attention if the employee had been guilty of such conduct while performing only his own job function. 'Griping' is not uncommon in the workplace. The case law seems uniform that one or more warnings to an employee must be given before it can be said such activity 'fractures the employment relationship'. The category of misconduct can be said to change from poor attitude to disobedience or insubordination where dismissal results after one or more warnings. 3)The plaintiff was entitled to 7 months notice to reflect the fact that junior management positions are fewer in number and the considerable wage difference between management and non- management positions.  4)The plaintiff was entitled to taxable costs.","FIAT. The plaintiff applied for summary judgment in his claim for dismissal without just cause brought pursuant to the simplified procedure outlined in Part Forty of the Rules of Court. The defendant opposed the application and requested a summary trial. HELD: The plaintiff was not terminated because of poor job performance in performing his contractual duties as bodyshop foreman and assistant manager but because of his alleged poor performance in doing the job normally assigned to two persons. The Court accepted the defendant's evidence wherever it conflicts with that of the plaintiff and concluded the plaintiff is entitled to judgment. 1) Rule 488 requires the presiding judge to grant judgment unless the judge is unable to decide the issues in the action in the absence of cross-examination. Taking all factors into account, the Court considers this is an appropriate notice period to which the plaintiff was entitled. 2) The defendant bears the burden of demonstrating there is a genuine need for trial. 3) The plaintiff's griping was not exactly unusual in a work place and the type of conduct alleged against the plaintiff would not justify dismissal the first time it came to the employer's attention, if he had been guilty of such conduct while performing only his job function. 4) In the case of a person in the plaintiff's position, who occupied a junior managerial position in a very specific industry, the notice period selected should reflect that management positions were fewer in number than non-management positions, and that there was a considerable wage difference between a management position and a non- management one."

A pedestrian was crossing a road adjacent to a parking lot and, while walking directly in front of a stopped vehicle, was struck by the vehicle when it rolled forward. HELD: The accused is not guilty. The court accepted the accused's evidence that his vehicle rolled forward only a short distance of not more than one foot and not at a fast or accelerated speed and that the pedestrian was crossing outside of the cross walk and that the accused applied his brakes as soon as he saw the pedestrian. The accused did exercise due diligence.","The accused was charged with driving without due care and attention contrary to s. 44(1) of the Highway Traffic Act. The accused was on duty in a marked police car when he was struck by the vehicle. As he was driving through a parking lot, the accused stopped his vehicle and backed up to assist another officer on a 'non-priority' matter. The second part of the test was whether the Crown had proved that the accused had'reduced' his speed by any significant degree of force. The officer's evidence that he thought the accused was going too fast was not supported by the accused's own recollection of how fast the vehicle was. The Court found that the officer had no reason to believe that the vehicle moved too short a distance before striking the accused. The action was found to be careless driving, as it could not reasonably have been anticipated that a person of that speed would have been so close in front of him."
b_1996canlii5028.txt,"Guardian was the general liability insurer for Kellogg. Royal was the primary insurer as holder of Kellogg's blanket fleet coverage. Kellogg's employee was involved in a motor vehicle accident while on company business but was driving his wife's vehicle at the time of the accident. Royal denied coverage and refused to defend on the basis of an exclusionary provision regarding the use of substitute automobiles. It was held at trial that Royal was not obligated to participate. HELD: 1)The case law reveals some inconsistencies with respect to the relationship between the duty to defend and the coverage provided by the policy. Where the policy clearly does not provide coverage, the insurer had no duty to defend. Where a policy only provides coverage for some allegations the insurer is only obligated to defend those allegations which may trigger the obligation to indemnify. When a policy is ambiguous some courts have adopted Thames and have stated the mere possibility that the policy may provide coverage is sufficient to oblige the insurer to defend. 2)Section 209 provides no guidelines as to the scope of the inquiry the judge may engage in. The chamber judge did not define the scope of his inquiry and stated that the standard suggestion that Guardian must raise an arguable point was 'off target'. To determine whether an insurer has the obligation to defend a chamber judge must examine the coverage provided by the policy. The judge made no finding of ambiguity in the exclusionary provision. He simply determined the Honda was not covered by the Royal policy and did not decide the issue of indemnity. 3)The affidavit evidence indicated that the parties lived in the same premises thus that argument was without merit. CONCURRING JUDGMENT: The appeal was dismissed for different reasons.  1)There has been an acceptance of the general concept that the duty to defend is broader than the duty to indemnify. To order an insurer to defend a chamber judge need be less sure the policy provides coverage than would be the case for an actual determination of liability under the policy. 2)There was a factual element which could not be determined on this application such as whether a partially deflated tire constitutes a breakdown within the meaning of the policy and whether the automobile the employee was driving was owned by someone living in the same dwelling. 3)The question centered around the words used in clause 5 of the policy and who it referred to. There were inconsistencies in terminology. The policy should not be interpreted as though the restriction it contains on what automobile can be used as a temporary substitute should be ignored.","An appeal from an application for directions to determine whether Royal had an obligation to defend. The appellant was the primary insurer as the holder of the blanket fleet coverage of the respondent. When the provisions of the policy provide coverage for that which is alleged in the pleadings, the insurer is only obligated to defend those allegations which may trigger the obligation to indemnify. At issue was whether the chambers judge erred in his application of the principles of contract interpretation when he decided the Honda was not a 'temporary substitute automobile' within the terms of the Royal policy. HELD: The appeal was dismissed. 1)The chambers judge did not define the scope of his inquiry. He simply said in response to the respondent's argument that it merely must raise an arguable point that the standard suggestion by the defendant was 'off target'. 2)In any event, where a claim alleges facts which, if proven, would fall within the coverage of a policy the insurer has a duty to defend regardless of the truth or falsity of such allegations. The fact that the question is arguable should not be conclusive. 3)A more restricted inquiry on s.209(1) application could reduce the potential for inconsistent judgments created by the operation of s. 209(1). However, the court was required to embark on an extensive review."
d_2007skqb324.txt,"This is an application by the accused for an order that evidence obtained by way of a telephone interception be ruled inadmissible because it is irrelevant. Alternatively, the accused seeks exclusion of the intercepted communication on the basis that it was conducted in violation of s. 8 of the Charter and ought to be excluded under s. 24(2). The accused is charged with abuse of a position of trust contrary to s. 153(1)(a) of the Code. HELD: The evidence is admissible. The accused's application is dismissed. 1) After examining the transcript of the conversation, it is immediately evident that the contents of the communication are relevant. The complainant and the accused are discussing the intimate details of their relationship. The conversation is logically probative to the charge. 2) The learned provincial court judge did in fact have sufficient evidence before him to issue the telephone intercept authorization. The complainant was prepared to initiate a telephone call to the accused and engage him in a conversation which would likely cause the accused to make admissions or statements which could be confirmatory of her allegations. 3) The authorization clearly permits the police to intercept private communications in relation to an offence under s. 271(1) of the Code. That investigation was live and bona fide at the time that the authorization was obtained. The law in this country is that evidence of other crimes revealed during the course of a lawful intercept process does not render the evidence obtained inadmissible in relation to an offence not named in the authorization. The focus is on whether the interception was lawfully obtained and executed, not on what is discovered. Here the police obtained a valid authorization to intercept private communications in relation to an offence under s. 271(1) of the Code. During the investigation of that charge, they obtained evidence which is relevant to an offence under s. 153(1)(a) of the Code. The fact that the offence of s. 153(1)(a) is not named in the authorization nor included as an offence for which an authorization to intercept private communications could be obtained, does not affect the admissibility of the evidence. Therefore, there is no Charter breach. 4) Even if the evidence was obtained in violation of s. 8 of the Charter, such evidence is considered non-conscriptive evidence. Where the evidence is non-conscriptive, the court ought to go on to do a balancing as to whether or not the evidence ought to be excluded pursuant to s. 24(2) of the Charter. The factors to be considered are trial fairness, seriousness of the breach and the effect of exclusion. In this case if there is a breach, it was not serious and was inadvertent, the result of unmindful draftsmanship. There is no evidence of bad faith. There is no evidence of manipulation. The seriousness of the breach, if there was one, was minimal, and to admit the evidence would not bring the administration of justice into disrepute.","The accused was charged with two offences contrary to s. 8 of the Charter. The police believed that the accused sexually assaulted the complainant or alternatively had sexual contact with her while in position of trust and that it would be advantageous to their investigation to intercept telephone communication between the complainant and the accused wherein the complainant would attempt to engage the accused in conversation concerning the alleged improper activity. An authorization to intercept private communications was obtained from a Provincial Court judge. The complainant consented to the interception of the private communications and did in fact contact the accused and engage him in conversation that was surreptitiously intercepted by the police. The accused argued that the evidence of the conversation was inadmissible because it was irrelevant. The learned judge who issued the authorization did so in error because there was no basis upon which he could conclude there were reasonable grounds to believe that information concerning the offences would be obtained through the interception sought. HELD: The evidence was relevant and admissible in that it did not violate the accused's s.8 rights. Even if the offence was a serious one and was inadvertent, the breach did not lead to automatic exclusion under s. 24(2). The accused's application to exclude the evidence was dismissed. 1)There was insufficient evidence before the judge to issue the telephone intercept authorization. The judge did have sufficient evidence before him to issue it. 2)The breach was not serious or inadvertent and the evidence collected was limited to those specified offences. 3)The Court reviewed the provisions of the Criminal Code and there were case law violations and determined that the breach was non-conscriptive. 4)The evidence obtained pursuant to a valid authorization for intercept of private communications contained the following provision: 4.The participant telephone intercept conducted without judicial authorization was found to be in contravention of s.271(1) and 273.1(2)(c) of the Code. It is reasonable to presume that information related to the offence would be obtain through an interception sought when the complainant engaged the male in conversation involving their alleged sexual activity. The evidence obtained should be excluded. 5)After analyzing the provisions in R. v. Wijesinha and therelevant case authorities, the Court concluded that there is no Charter breach and that theevidence is in fact admissible and ought not to be excluded pursuant to S.24(1). 6)The information obtained as a result of the intercepted private communications may be traced back to the time the authorization was obtained. 7)The accused had sufficient evidence to admit the evidence."

e_1996canlii7080.txt,"FIAT. The Crown applied to have a witness, who was an unindicted co-conspirator and separately charged with drug offences arising out of the same investigation, declared adverse pursuant to s9 of the Canada Evidence Act. She had contradicted her prior video taped statement made shortly after her arrest and had demonstrated hostile attitude towards the Crown. The defence took the position that she was now telling the truth; that the statement was improperly obtained in breach of the confession rules of voluntariness and the statement did not meet the requirements set out in R. v. K.G.B. HELD: The witness' prior statement may be introduced in evidence for the substantive truth of its contents. It will be for the jury to decide what, if any, portions of such statement they wish to accept. 1)A prior inconsistent statement cannot be introduced in evidence for its substantive content, unless the requirement of necessity, and a threshold of reliability arrived at on a balance of probabilities are established. When, as here, a witness recants, the requirement of necessity is established. The real issue is whether the prior statement meets the test for reliability. When, as here, there is only one demonstrably false piece of testimony in the statement, which does not implicate anyone but rather attempts to exonerate someone, the Court was not prepared to say ipso facto the statement is unreliable. 2)The independent evidence sufficiently corroborated her statement in enough different particulars that, but for the demonstrably false portion, it met the threshold of reliability.","FIAT.

The defence sought to use her prior statement as substantive evidence. HELD: 1)Annette Cook's prior statement was improperly obtained in breach of the oath rules of voluntariness and 2)The oath was not administered prior to the taking of the statement and there was no warning provided at that time of her arrest of the perjury consequences of not telling the truth. It was a business decision made by accused persons who are asked to cooperate. There may be situations in which the trial judge concludes that an appropriate substitute for an oath is established and that notwithstanding the absence of an oath the statement is reliable. However, in this case the Court was satisfied that the reliability threshold is not met, even if the witness is sworn and warned prior to giving the statement, when it is subsequently known that at least a portion of that statement is false. The form of demeanour evidence is video tape. It is not possible to substitute an oath where appropriate substitutes for the oath exist. The present evidence does not support the allegation that the witness has been induced to lie. 2)There was insufficient solemnity attached to the occasion of her swearing the affidavit, to bring home to her the truth, that the oath she was taking would have the same effect as if she was testifying in court before a judge. The Court was not prepared to say that portions of this statement which did not implicate the accused person but rather attempts to exonerate someone were unreliable."
