"An appeal from a refusal of certiorari or other relief on review of decision of a disciplinary tribunal of Investment Dealers Association. The appellant alleged that the panel acted unreasonably and in bad faith in charging him with infractions in charges (i) and (iii) that were clearly not his responsibility. The charges involved disclosure of information about federal cabinet minister; permitting employees to take part in'side deals' (trades in securities not approved by his head office); failing to ensure proper records were kept of the side deals; and failing to supervise an employee who was involved in side deals. Allowing the appeal, that even if the Board's findings were wrong, the Court should not interfere with their decision. There was no error of law on the appellant's part in finding the Charter had no application in the present case.","This was an appeal from a judgment refusing to gram certiorari and other relief following findings by the respondent disciplinary panel that the appellant was guilty of professional misconduct. The appellant sought declaratory relief or relief under s. 24(1) of the Charter. Dismissing the appeal that (1) the Charter has no application to this self-regulating body; (2) the panel was properly constituted in accordance with the respondent's by-laws; (3) the panel acted within its jurisdiction; (4) there was no evidence of bad faith on the part of the panel members; (5) the panel complied with the rules of natural justice, and (6) the trial judge, in refusing to grant certiorari, made no errors in so concluding."
"The estate was devastated by a motor vehicle accident. The estate sought exclusion from the discovery examination and other examinations. The deceased's children, who were executors and trustees of the estate, brought an application to have the exclusion ordered. The children, in their various capacities, sought the exclusion of the father, who was to appear on the evidence. Allowing the application, that the evidence did not suggest that there would be a violation of an essential of justice if the parties were not excluded from hearing the evidence of each other.","The defendants applied to exclude the plaintiff grandchildren of the deceased from their respective discovery examinations in connection with an action under the Fatal Injuries Act. Dismissing the application, that there was insufficient evidence to indicate there would be a violation of an essential of justice if the parties were excluded from hearing each other's testimony. The only evidence before the court was that the lines of questioning of each grandchild would be identical. This was insufficient to displace a party's inherent right to attend his co-party's discovery."
"The applicant sought an order of prohibition and certiorari directing that judge Archibald and any other provincial court judge could not hear the trial of the accused in Queen v. Jessome. The defence had attempted to co-operate with the court in setting dates and co-operated to the extent that a witness was not available at the date of the trial. The judge granted the adjournment. The applicant's application was dismissed. The decision as to whether or not to grant an adjournment was within the jurisdiction of the judge and that any decision in that regard was an exercise of his discretion within that authority. If there is any remedy, it is open to the court to seek the assistance of the prerogative writ.","The applicant sought an order for certiorari quashing a decision of the trial judge granting an adjournment and a prohibition from hearing the trial. In earlier hearings, the Crown and applicant had each sought new trial dates to ensure procurement of witnesses for trial. The Crown sought to subpoena the victim to testify. Due to the delay in obtaining authority to serve an out of town subpoena in New Brunswick, the Crown was unable to serve the victim until three days before trial. The victim did not learn of the trial date until the day before and was unable to attend. An adjournment was granted. The applicant contended the trial judge had exceeded his jurisdiction. Dismissing the application. It is within the jurisdiction of the trial judge to deal with the issue of adjournments in accordance with the provisions of the Criminal Code. Jurisdictional error is not to be equated with error of law. Any decision to grant an adjournment is therefore within the court's proper discretion. If a remedy exists, it is by way of an appeal and not a prerogative writ. In any event, the sequence of events was sufficient to justify the granting of an adjournment. There was neither neglect nor laches on the part of the Crown."
"The Crown appeals the disposition of the cases. In addition to the large number of theft offences, the defendant used a stolen vehicle in a high speed chase with the police resulting in extensive damage to the vehicle. The defendant pled guilty to 16 counts of auto theft, one count of possession of stolen auto and one count dangerous driving. He spent 13 days on remand and approximately 2 months under strict parental control on house arrest under s. 7.1 of the Young Offenders Act prior to receiving a disposition of 6 months open custody and 2 years probation on September 7, 1994. The Crown appeals this disposition arguing it is not fit having regard for the number of offences and the need to maintain the public's confidence in the administration of justice. HELD: Appeal allowed. 1)The Youth Court judge counted the time J.M. spent under house arrest as secure custody and 18 months of open custody. 2)The defendant had made great change during the course of this period. He had been involved in a number of car thefts, one of which was a successful escape, and had made a conscious decision not to do so. 3)The sentence imposed on the defendant was four months open Custody.","The accused, a young offender, pleaded guilty to 16 counts of auto theft. He was sentenced to 6 months open custody and 2 years probation. Prior to being sentenced, he spent 13 days on remand and 2 months under house arrest under s.7.1 of the Young Offenders Act. The Crown appealed the sentence. HELD: Appeal allowed. 1)The accused was 15 years of age and had no record. He assisted the police once apprehended. 2)Although another young offender involved in these offences had received a sentence of 9 months open custody, uniformity of sentence was not a factor to be given great weight in comparing dispositions of young offenders. 3)The sentence was increased to 10 months open custody."
"The plaintiff alleged that in 1988 he purchased aircraft parts from the defendants, such parts being parts being PA-11 fuselage. The defendant was in the business of manufacturing and selling such parts in the U.S.A. The aircraft crashed in August 1992, and the plaintiff alleges the crash was due to faulty and substandard materials used by the defendant in the manufacture or construction of the package. The defendants applied to have the Originating Notice and Statement of Claim set aside as this Court has no jurisdiction, or to has the action stayed on the basis of forum conveniens. Forum non conveniens were found in this case and the plaintiffs choice of forum was a reasonable one.","The plaintiff purchased aircraft parts from the American defendant. The plane crashed in Nova Scotia and the plaintiff, claiming negligence by the defendants in the manufacture of the parts, commenced an action in Nova Scotia. The defendants applied to declare Nova Scotia forum non conveniens. Dismissing the application, that there is a real and substantial connection to both jurisdictions and the plaintiff's forum choice appeared reasonable and should not be disturbed."
The appellant sought to have the support payments ordered by the chamber judge increased on the basis the respondent was incorrectly estimated and should have been found to be much greater. The respondent agreed to include 20 percent of his capital cost allowance as part of his income and this was accepted by the trial judge who recognized that commercial realities require the replacement of farm equipment. HELD: The appeal was dismissed with the usual costs on double Column V. The appellant seeks to have respondent's income increased by adding the value of unsold grain on hand and 100 percent of the capital cost allowances. There is clearly no basis for adding the weight of the grain onhand to the income of the respondent. There was no indication of any underhanded or inappropriate action by the respondent and this grain is therefore to be viewed as a part of the gross income of his respondent in the year in which it is sold. The appeal is dismissed with costs on triple Column V to the respondent who appealed the rejection of the figure by the chambers judge in this instance.,The appellant sought to have the support payments ordered by the chambers judge increased on the basis the income of the respondent was incorrectly estimated and should have been increased by adding the value of unsold grain on hand and 100 percent of his capital cost allowance. HELD: The appeal was dismissed with costs. 1)There was clearly no basis for adding the value of the grain on hand to the income of the respondent. There was no indication of any underhanded or inappropriate action on the part of the respondent and the grain was to be viewed as part of his gross income in the year in which it was sold. 2)There was no reversible error by the chamber judge in accepting the respondent's agreement to include 20 percent of his capital cost allowance as part of his income. What if any portion should be added must be based on the facts of each case.
"FIAT. The applicant sought an order staying the hearing pending a decision of the respondent Authority to suspend the applicant's 'tavern permit' for 3 days until criminal charges arising out of the same facts wereposed of. HELD: The application was dismissed with costs. 1)There was no obvious prejudice to the applicant in allowing the Commission's hearing to proceed, and certainly none was attested to. The disclosure of any defence in the Commission hearing was not going to result in any new facts that were not already known to it. 2)The Commission hearing would be completely unopposed to a procedural one and in any event was effectively disposed of by R. v. Wigglesworth (1987 CanLII 41). There was nothing inconsistent with the respondent Commission's decision to consider a form of disqualification of the appellant's application if the Commissionhearing was allowed to take place as scheduled. 3)The applicant failed to show any prejudice to its criminal defence if the civil proceedings were not stayed.","FIAT. The applicant hotel was charged with five breaches of s.112(1)of the Alcohol and Gaming Act for failing to demand proof of age from minors. The hotel was convicted on one charge and the remaining charges were held in abeyance pending its appeal. The hotel sought an order staying the hearing scheduled by the Commission to review a decision of the Authority suspending the applicant's tavern permit for three days, pending disposal of the criminal charges. Grounds for a stay were that the Commission's hearing would prejudice its defence on the criminal charges because it will be necessary to call similar defence evidence with respect to each proceeding; secondly, it would be manifestly unfair to have a decision for a potential penalty imposed by the Commission which may be contradictory to a finding of fact and a determination of guilt on the same facts and information before the Provicial Court. HELD: The application was dismissed with costs. 1)The second ground raised a substantive issue and in any event was effectively disposed of by R. v. Wigglesworth. There was nothing inconsistent with the Commission considering a form of disqualification of the applicant's license or permit, while the state exercises its criminal law power with respect to the same set of facts. 2)The applicant failed to show any prejudice to its criminal defence. The disclosure of any defence in the Commission hearing will not result in any new facts that were not already known to the Crown."
"The accused was charged with operating a motor vehicle while unlawfully possessing marijuana and contrary to s. 4(1) the Narcotic Control Act, unlawfully cultivating and possessing cannabis. A voir dire was conducted to determine the admissibility of marijuana plants seized as a result of a warrantless search. The police officer observed the accused and the vehicle stopped on a grid road leading to a Saskatchewan tourist information booth. As he approached the vehicle, the officer noticed that one of the pockets of the accused's jeans appeared to bulge and he asked the accused if he would empty his pockets. The accused said he was looking for a place to relieve himself. At this point the officer indicated that he was going to try and open the black box. The voir net was conducted and the accused was arrested. The Crown did not offer any explanation for the question as to why it was asked that question. HELD: The accused was not detained, nor any search of the vehicle commenced. Even if the question 'where are you going' was innocuous social conversation, that search was made without the requisite foundation of reasonable and probable grounds. It was therefore an unreasonable search in contravention of s. of the Charter.  1) The Court held that a stopping vehicle as part of a random check stop constitutes detention of the operator of a vehicle. Once an individual has been detained and is asked if there are any problems with the vehicle or if he is seeking assistance, that a search presupposes detention and suggests that the search began with the questioning of the individual. 2) Counsel argues the search was unreasonable as it was not authorized by law. It is said the search itself began when Cst. McLaughlin without any legal authority turned the roadside encounter into a general inquisition to satisfy his curiosity as to what was in the back of the van. Once the accused has asked if he has anything of note or note in the bag, he is advised that he has to return to the vehicle. 3) The accused's statement that he did not require any assistance from the officer was not supported by the evidence. The officer was acting in the context of a search warrantless. The Court was not satisfied that the officer had reasonable or probable grounds to believe the accused had consented to the search. There were no exigent circumstances to justify the search which would justify a warrant without the proper foundation of evidence. 4) Counsel was satisfied that even if the officer told the accused that he had two cases of wine in the van, he was not able to open the box as","The accused was charged with three offences under the Narcotic Control Act. The accused contests the admissibility of marijuana plants seized by the police. A police officer on highway patrol approaching the Manitoba border noticed a rental van with Ontario license plates stopped on the road. The police officer stated he had no reason to believe an offence had been committed and he approached the accused to see if he required any assistance. The officer stated it was his practice to offer assistance to motorists. The officer asked the accused if there were any problems with the vehicle and the accused answered he was looking for a place to relieve himself. The officer asked him where he was going and was told BC. He then asked the accused what he had in the back of the van and was told two cases of wine. The officer testified the accused was no longer free to go as he had believed the accused committed an offence under the Alcohol and Gaming Regulation Act. The officer searched the vehicle without a warrant and discovered 524 marijuana plants ranging in size from three to nine inches. HELD: The evidence is excluded. The police officer when he pulled up to the van was not in investigative mode but pulled up to see if he could offer assistance. The officer had no reason to suspect the accused was involved in a crime. When he asked what was in the back of the van the officer was fishing to see what answer he got. The Court is satisfied by the cases of Mellenthin, Young and Simpson, that if a person who has been detained cannot be asked what is in their gym bag or their pocket, how can a citizen who is not detained be asked a similar question. The s.8 right against unreasonable search and seizure involves balancing the citizen's reasonable expectation of privacy against the states interest in law enforcement. The police officer's question as to what was in the back of the van was unrelated to the purpose for which he had engaged the accused in conversation. The fact is the officer was attempting to determine what was in the back of the van and searching to see what answer he would get. The Court is satisfied the warrantless search began when the police officer asked the accused what was in the back of the van. The onus of a warrantless search is on the crown which has not established the search was authorized by law. The accused's right to unreasonable search and seizure was violated. The evidence was conscriptive in that the accused was compelled to participate in the discovery of the evidence as a result of the unreasonable search which began when the officer asked what was in the back of the van. The result is the admission of the marijuana into evidence would render the trial unfair and bring the administration of justice into disrepute unless the crown establishes that the evidence would likely have been discovered in any event. The crown suggested no basis upon which the evidence would likely have been discovered in any event."
"The applicant was convicted in July 1997 of several offences, consisting in the main of sexual offences involving members of his family and others close to him. He appealed against his convictions, and the Crown appealed against their sentence. On September 16, 1998 this Court dismissed his appeal against his conviction and allowed the Crown's appeal, increasing the sentence from five to ten years. Throughout, the applicant was represented by senior counsel Mr. S. Halyk Q.C. The applicant decided not to seek leave to appeal to the Supreme Court on any of the grounds raised in the original application and instead applied to the Court of Appeal for an extension of time to apply on one or more of the stronger grounds. In the meantime the applicant wanted to be released from custody. HELD: The application for release was dismissed. 1)The prospective appeal as a whole was not frivolous and the applicant's continued detention for the time being was not necessary in the public interest. 2)The grounds relied upon had sufficient merit to satisfy the requirements of s.679(3) of the section. 3)The present release of the applicant would be inimical to the general public interest, given the history of the past proceedings, the current state of the present proceedings and the prospect for the applicant succeeding either in having all of the convictions set aside or in having the sentence reduced to the time already served.","See also 150 SaskR 185.In 1998 the Court of Appeal dismissed the applicant's sentence appeal and appeal of his 1997 convictions which consisted primarily of sexual offences involving family members and others. The sentence of imprisonment was increased from 5 to 10 years. The applicant, on advice of two counsel, did not initially seek leave to appeal to the Supreme Court of Canada. He changed his mind 2 years later and sought an extension of time to apply for leave and for leave to appeal. The applicant brought an application for release from custody pending the SCC's decision. HELD: The application was dismissed without prejudice to reapply should leave to appeal be granted. 1)The application was premature. The application pending before the SCC was likely to be determined within 3 to 4 months. The Court of Appeal was not satisfied the appeal as a whole was not frivolous having regard for the requirements of s.679(3)(a) and (c). Some grounds for appeal would clearly fail such as the ground the Court of Appeal erred in failing to give reasons for its judgment. The new grounds of appeal were difficult to assess on the basis of the incomplete material before the court. 2)His continued detention was necessary in the public interest having regard for the whole of the circumstances. His release would undermine public confidence in the administration of justice."
"Three motions were brought under Queen's Bench Rule 173(a) and 188 to have the plaintiff's claim dismissed. The first motion was brought by the former police officer who alleged that the Crown had not commenced a new action against him within the time limit set out in the Limitation of Actions Act. The second motion sought to have his claim dismissed on the basis that a portion of the claim was based on Rule 579(2) of the Code but also relied on Queen' Bench Rules 173(e) and (f) that permit the Crown to commence new proceedings within a year from the date of the stay of proceedings. HELD: The applications were dismissed with costs under double Column V and the order to be retroactive to September 9, 1994. 1)With the consent of the plaintiff, the application to dismiss the claim as being statute barred was allowed. The remaining substantive issues were whether the action was barred by a statutory limitation period, whether any limitation period should be extended nunc pro tunc, whether the plaintiff had disclosed a cause of action against the defendants because there was no allegation of malice, whether there was a factual component to the claim and whether the claim had a prima facie case. 2)The limitation period did not commence until after the expiration of the 1 year limitation period. There was no evidence before the Crown as to when the limitation period had expired. 3)The claim was struck because the facts did not provide a factual basis upon which to proceed with the action. The Court of Appeal had held that a limitation period does not exist within the meaning of s.53 of the Act. 4)Limitation of actions are substantive in character as opposed to procedural. The Act does not apply to an action against a registrar of land titles under the Land Titles Act. 5)A limitation period is a transitional period and can only be set aside when the action is recommenced. A limitation period of 1 year has expired since the entry of this Act. A review of the statute and the circumstances of the various torts and defendants will be held in order to determine whether the individual has a case to file for a review pursuant to s.173(e). 5)Leave must be obtained prior to the date the action commenced. 6)Statutes of fact must be addressed. 7)The facts must be examined. 8)Whether there was any breach of a Charter right or a breach of any other right. 9)The statements of claim must be made before any legislation governing the Public Officers' Protection","FIAT. The infant complainants, who alleged sexual assault and other offences, failed to identify the plaintiff, a former police officer, and a stay of proceedings was entered in 1993.  The plaintiff commenced an action in 1994 for malicious prosecution, negligence, conspiracy and breach of Charter rights and claimed general, specific, punitive and aggravated damages, interest and costs.  Two motions to dismiss the plaintiff's claim were brought under Queen's Bench Rules 173(a) and 188, plus Rule 173(e) in the motion brought by the two chiefs of police. The plaintiff sought several orders in a third motion, two of which were granted summarily; one was adjourned sine die. The applicants submitted the action should be struck, except for claims based on malice, because it was not commenced within the time prescribed by the Public Officers' Protection Act (POPA). Referring to the 2 year and 6 year limitation periods prescribed by s.3(1)(d) and (j) of the Limitations of Actions Act (LAA), the applicants argued a retroactive order for further time was prohibited because a second limitation period had expired. The substantive issues were whether the plaintiff's claim was barred by statutory limitation periods; whether any limitation period should be extended nunc pro tunc; whether a portion of the plaintiff's claim failed to disclose a cause of action against five of the defendants because there was no allegation of malice; whether the plaintiff's claim in tort against the Government of Saskatchewan was barred by statute. HELD: 1)The time to bring the action was extended to September 10, 1994, retroactive to September 8, 1994. The applications to have the action dismissed as having been commenced beyond the statutory limitation period were dismissed. Whether the limitation period was extended was best determined at trial. It was not certain the limitation period was not extended as the statement of claim alluded to subsequent conduct by some defendants. As a general rule, the statutory limitation period created by s.2(1)(a) of the POPA commences to run when a stay of proceedings is entered pursuant to s.579 of the Criminal Code. Although a stay has been entered, actionable conduct of a public officer may continue. The only limitation period applicable in this case is s.2(1) of the POPA. Limitation periods are substantive in character, as opposed to procedural. The LAA does not supersede or replace s.2 of the POPA. The intent and purpose of the LAA is to avoid conflict with other legislation by removing its application from situations specifically dealt with by other legislation. The limitation in the POPA is not necessarily absolute. 2)The application by the chiefs of police to strike the claim in negligence was dismissed. The position in Beckstead v. Ottawa and Reynen v. Canada was adopted. The immunity in s.10 of the Police Act does not extend protection to police officers in general. 3)The claim in negligence against the other defendants was struck without prejudice to amend pleadings. The pleadings as to the Crown Attorneys were struck. They could not be saved, absent an allegation of moral turpitude implicit in malice, bad faith or improper purpose. 4)The Government's application was granted in part, such that all the claims were dismissed except those alleging conspiracy and Charter breaches. The Crown does not enjoy absolute immunity and must bring itself within s.5(6)(a) or (b) of the Proceedings Against the Crown Act which will depend on the particular facts. Immunity does exist for malicious prosecution and negligence. If the decision to prosecute is protected, then the conduct in carrying out the decision should be afforded the same protection. A claim for negligence could not be maintained against the government as employer where it was struck against the Crown Attorneys. Leave to amend pleadings was not entertained as the plaintiff failed to give advance notice.  5)The two applications based on Rule 188 providing for a determination of a point of law were dismissed as there was a factual component. An order should not be granted under Rule 188 in the absence of an agreed statement of fact. 6)The plaintiff demonstrated a prima facie cause of action; provided a reasonable explanation for the delay given the circumstances and his emotional and mental state at the time; and no prejudice will flow to the defendants as they had all actively participated in the litigation from the outset. The only reasonable course was to grant a retroactive order given the time, effort and money already expended. It was not appropriate to require the action be commenced anew.  7)No costs."
"At issue is the interim custody of the child. The parties began to cohabit in 1998. In May 1999, the parties would'switch Keanna every second day' and that is what happened. In April 2000, the respondent was allowed to have every second weekend. Since that time, the child has resided with the petitioner and the respondent. The petitioner claims that the parties had an arrangement from the outset whereby the respondent would see the child every second Sunday and every weekend thereafter. The respondent has had access. HELD: The child has and does reside with the respondent with access and visitation arrangements to the respondent and reasonable telephone access. Notwithstanding the instances of suspended access, the arrangements for access appear to be in the petitioner's best interests. There is plenty of affidavit evidence to support this. The child is doing well and has a loving, stable relationship with her mother. The court found that the respondent made no attempts at gaining custody until he was served with the application of the petitioner.","At issue was the interim custody of the child and child support. HELD: Interim custody was given to the petitioner with access to the respondent. The respondent was ordered to pay interim child support in the amount of $193 per month. On an interim custody application, the Court must take into account the status quo."
"The Superintendent of Pensions sought leave to appeal an order staying six separate proceedings brought by him in purported exercise of powers conferred on him by s.8 of The Pension Benefits Act, 1992 and Regulations made thereunder. The subject matter of the action and the Superintendent's applications was the same, namely certain monies that his estranged wife had paid into a pension plan and in which she had an interest by reason of judicial division of matrimonial property. HELD: The application was dismissed with costs. The court found that the letter of August 6, 2002 was not the direction of the Superintendent, which may be enforced pursuant to s.16 of the Act and that its decision respecting his powers was open to him to proceed with his applications when the McMaster action was finished and that her decision respecting the powers he claimed to have and purported to exercise was not strictly necessary to the decision. The matter was also addressed as preliminary issue only without any adjudication on the merits. The decision was left open for the Superintendent to argue another day in the stayed proceeding or in another case in proper factual context, which was lacking here.","The Superintendent of Pensions seeks leave to appeal an order staying six separate proceedings brought by him in purported exercise of powers conferred on him by s. 8 of The Pension Benefits Act, 1992. HELD: The application was dismissed. It was clear that the judge's finding was for procedural purposes only and was not intended to be definitive. The judge left it open to the Superintendent to proceed with his applications when the McMaster action was finished and that her decision respecting his powers was open to review upon further evidence being adduced."
"The court granted the divorce on the grounds of a breakdown of the marriage and the fact that the parties had lived separate and apart for more than a year prior to the commencement of the proceeding. The court retained the interest they acquired in their own pensions and the parties agreed to be designated joint custodians of the children. The mother sought to have the father's access to take place every second weekend and the father make child support payments in accordance with the Federal Child Support Guidelines by paying a table amount in his income and by making a contribution to the $800 child care cost. The father sought to vary his parenting time so that he and the mother would equally share their time with the children, with the exception of Remembrance Day, when the children would be in the care of one parent for an extended period of time. HELD: The current parenting arrangements are in effect. The parties have been able to perform this difficult parenting task in their children's best interest. The more specific the decision is, the more restrictions are placed in the way of the parents continuing their successful performing of this function.","The parties, who were the parents of two children, separated after a seven year marriage. For the five years since the separation, their parenting time with the children had been distributed on a two-week basis. In the divorce proceeding, the mother, who planned to remarry and relocate, sought to become the primary caregiver of the children, with the father to have access only every second weekend. The father sought to vary the parenting time so that both parents would equally share their time with the children. Current parenting arrangement to remain in effect with the parties retaining joint custody of the children; table amount of child support set. The parenting pattern followed for the past five years had been working well for the children and appeared to be serving their needs; the mother's proposal would lessen the children's time with their father and the father's proposal would also create a significant change for the children, removing their current home base."
"The accused was struck in the arm by the defendant's right hand as he walked down the driveway towards the property. The defendant had a shovel in his hand and the accused had a knife. The knife was not in the accused's hand as the defendant had pulled it out of his pants. The altercation continued and the defendant suffered fractures to his elbow and rib cage as result of the assault. The accused and the victim both suffered from fractures to their upper arm. The defence evidence established a prima facie case inasmuch as that evidence establishes that the defendant intentionally struck the victim and thereby granted him his right to enter a premises for the purpose of preventing a trespass. The Court found that the accused, by driving in anger to the property and entering thereon despite being told not to enter upon the property, placed himself in the role of an aggressor. It would have been reasonable for the accused to have believed the defendant to be a trespasser and thereby justified in using no more force than was necessary to prevent the perceived trespass.","Immediately after the complainant accused the defendant of stealing lumber from his property and directed him to remain off the property, the defendant entered upon the complainant's property in a state of anger to challenge the complainant's authority to issue such a direction. The complainant armed himself with a knife when the defendant entered the property, at which point the defendant grabbed a shovel, moved towards the complainant, struck him on the arm with the shovel and punched him in the ribs while he was on the ground. The complainant suffered a fractured ulna bone and a fractured rib. The defendant, who was charged with aggravated assault, assault by using or threatening to use a weapon and possession of a weapon, claimed to have acted in self-defence. Defendant found guilty of all three charges; conviction entered only on the aggravated assault charge. The actions of the complainant were justifiable as using no more force than was necessary to prevent a perceived trespass; the defendant, who was under no imminent danger, and could reasonably have retreated  upon seeing the knife, instead chose to arm himself with a shovel and strike the complainant."
"The Minister sought an order pursuant to s. 37(3) of the Child and Family Services Act placing the children in the Minister's care until each child turned 18 years. The mother opposed the request for long term orders for the three children. HELD: The questions are answered as follows: 1) are the children of S.T. who is legally married to S.M. The Minister seeks an order under s. 11 of the Act declaring Katie, Hannah and Bobby to be children in need of protection pursuant to S 37(1)(a) of The Child andFamily Services Act. The children are: 1. the children are in the mother's care pursuant to ss. 37 of the act and pursuant to the Minister’s order for long-term orders respecting each of the children pursuant to this Act. 2. The evidence is the mother’ s. 1(1) child. The child was exposed to harmful interaction for sexual purpose, including involvement in prostitution and conduct that may amount to an offence within the meaning of the Criminal Code. S. T. indicated he was unable to attend trial because he was ill. STS: 1)(1) the mother was to have access with the children for a minimum of 3 times per week for a total of 4 hours. The parents were to have weekly parenting classes and participate in a parenting program. The father of one of the three boys testified that he was concerned that the mother would not be able to provide for the children’S needs. The Mother testified that she had never seen J.M hit any of the boys. She also testified that the child had been exposed to elements of the criminal justice system, including being sexually assaulted by her own son and being subjected to threats and physical harm by others. The Court reviewed the various specialists who had been involved with the child and concluded that the most important issue was the appropriate order to be made, respecting each child pursuant to that Act. 3) The evidence was the mother. The court found that the children were in needof protection pursuant s. 9 of theAct. The following are the questions: 1.) are the mother and child in need; 2) the child protection worker was in contact with the mother by telephone as it was anticipated that she would appear for trial; 3) the school principal was in receipt of information regarding the children; and 4) the evidence was a result of the mother having chosen to participate in an unauthorized proceeding. The information was conclusive and the court found the following:","The eldest daughter, 15 years old, her sister, 14 years old, and their brother, 12 years old, were apprehended from their mother on 2 March 2006. The Minister sought an order pursuant to s. 37(3) of The Child and Family Services Act placing the children in the care of the Minister until each child turned the age of 18 years. The mother opposed the Minister's request for long term orders for the three children, taking the position that the children were not 'children in need of protection' pursuant to s. 11 of the Act, and that the children should be immediately returned to her care. In the alternative, the mother proposed that the court make a short term supervisory order under s. 37(1)(a) of the Act, returning the children to the mother's care under supervision and conditions. The issues were: 1) whether the children were children in need of protection pursuant to s. 11 of The Child and Family Services Act; and 2) if so, the appropriate order to be made, respecting each of the children, pursuant to s. 37 of the Act. HELD: The children are children in need of protection pursuant to s. 11(a)(i),(v), (vi) and 11(b) of the Act. There shall be an order pursuant to s. 37(3) of the Act that the children be placed in the custody of the Minister until each child attains the age of 18 years. There shall also be an order with respect to access. It is well established that child protection proceedings involve a two step process. First, there must be a determination pursuant to s. 36(1) as to whether the child is in need of protection as that term is defined in s. 11. If it is determined that a child is in need of protection the next step is to determine the appropriate order among the options contained in s. 37.The Ministry had a legitimate concern that, based on a prior conviction for assaulting the child of a previous common-law partner, the mother's common-law partner posed a risk to the children. The Ministry acted appropriately by requesting the execution of a parental services agreement (PSA) with a condition therein that her partner should not have any unsupervised time with them. The Ministry had evidence that the partner and the mother breached the terms of the PSA. They received information from the school, neighbours, the children and, importantly, the mother herself, that the partner was having unsupervised contact with the children. The Ministry then proceeded to apprehend the children in light of its concern regarding possible harm to the children at his hands. The Ministry made an appropriate determination that the children were in need of protection as a result. If the court is wrong in the determination that s. 11(a)(i) is applicable, it finds that all three children were in any event in need of protection pursuant to s. 11(v), (vi) and s. 11(b) of the Act. The Ministry had evidence that the mother was having difficulties caring for the two children with special needs. The mother's actions could have, and likely did, impair the development of the children. Further, with respect to domestic violence, the mother herself characterized her relationship with the partner as emotionally abusive. Finally, having reached conclusions that there was risk to the children, the Ministry determined that there was no other adult person able or willing to provide for the children's needs as set out in s. 11(b) of the Act. The mother argues, in addition, that the children are no longer in need of protection. Thus, the court has to determine whether there has been sufficient change since March 2006 so as to conclude that the children are no longer in need of protection and can immediately be returned to the mother's care. Unfortunately, the court cannot reach that conclusion. Indeed, the mother herself acknowledged that it would be a slow process regarding unification of the children into her home. The mother continues to object to suggestions made by the Ministry to improve her parenting abilities. Although the mother appears to have come some distance in understanding she has problems, she continues to resist recommendations for change. She continues to fight the Ministry as opposed to cooperating with it. For these reasons, and the reasons set out above, the children continue to be children in need of protection pursuant to s. 11 of the Act. The Ministry seeks an order pursuant to s. 37(3) that the three children be placed in the custody of the Minister until each child attains the age of 18 years. The mother says that a more appropriate order would be a short term supervisory order pursuant to s. 37(1)(a) of the Act. All three children love their mother and want to continue to spend time with their mother. However, they are doing extremely well in their current foster placements. In this case, the age of the three children is a critical factor. The children are now 15, 14 and 12 years old. There is not much time for the mother to take all the necessary steps she needs to take before the children are returned to her and the time the children will be reaching the age of 18 years. The Ministry has not pursued a permanent order under s. 37(2) of the Act. Indeed, the mother and the grandmother should continue to play a substantial role in the children's lives. An order pursuant to s. 37(3) of the Act, placing the children in the custody of the Minister until each child reaches the age of 18 years is the appropriate order in this case. The mother will, with a long term order, have the ability to make the necessary changes in her life and, if she does so, apply for a variation of this order in the future."
"The plaintiff, certified organic farmer, sold organic oats to the defendant who in turn sold the oats through a broker in Ontario to the ultimate destination being a miller in Germany. The German miller rejected some of the oats as having a high moisture content and refused to pay the farmer. HELD: The plaintiff was entitled to full payment of the contractual price.  1) The testimony before the court established that the contract as described above was validly entered into between Wlaswich and Bio Canada. The quality requirements of the contract had been met. 2) There was nothing in the contract with the farmer in which he was to continue to accept risk of non-acceptance or non-payment from any third party. He was an interested party in the whole transaction and no evidence was led that he had sufficient skill with respect to knowledge and use of the German language to allow proper interpretation of the documents. 3) The documents submitted by Bio Canada were not admitted into evidence.  4) The issue of whether the plaintiff fulfilled his contractual obligations to the company and thus entitled to a full payment was of little relevance in the final conclusion.  5) The plaintiff had judgment against the defendant in the sum of $51,608. The plaintiff has claimed pre-judgment interest. There is no legal reason why Bio Canada should not have made payment of all the sum owing to Wlwich. He is entitled to costs on a party-party basis under Schedule I 'B', Column 3 of the Tariff of Costs.","The plaintiff entered into a contract with the defendant for the sale of organic oats. The contract between the plaintiff and defendant stipulated that the oats were to be delivered at a stipulated moisture content. The defendant accepted the oats from the plaintiff and did not indicate any issue with the moisture content. In turn, the defendant sold the oats to a broker for shipment to Germany. When the oats arrived overseas, the German buyer rejected the oats saying they had heated and did not meet his required moisture content. The defendant refused to pay the plaintiff the amount owing under the contract and argued the plaintiff had failed to meet his contractual obligation. HELD: The contract was between the plaintiff and defendant. The defendant accepted delivery of the oats from the plaintiff and did not object to their quality. The evidence before the Court was that the defendant had no complaint with the moisture content of the oats at the time of delivery by the plaintiff. There was nothing in the contract between the plaintiff and defendant that allowed the defendant to transfer the shipping acceptance risk to the plaintiff. The resale of the oats to Germany was the defendant's responsibility and the plaintiff is not a party to the contact with the German company. The plaintiff was awarded the balance of the contract price, plus pre-judgment interests and costs."
"Fulltext of judgment follows: [1] In light of the standard of appellate review (laid down in cases such as Lensen v. Lensen, 1987 CanLII 4 (SCC), [1987] 2 S.C.R. 672 and Fontaine v. British Columbia (Official Administrator), 1998 CanL II 814 (sCC), and having regard for the evidence in support of the findings of fact made by Mr. Justice Maurice, we are of the view there is no tenable basis to interfere with his judgment, both as it pertains to the inventory and valuation of the matrimonial property of the parties and to the issue of spousal support. [2] Accordingly, the appeal is dismissed, with costs to the respondent, such costs to be taxed in the usual manner.",No facts were cited. HELD: The appeal was dismissed with taxed costs to the respondent. There was no tenable basis to interfere with the judgment with respect to the inventory and valuation of matrimonial property and issue of spousal support given the standard of appellate review and the evidence in support of the findings of fact.
"The accused was charged with sexual assault and sexual assault contrary to s. 271 of the Criminal Code. The accused sought to exclude DNA evidence on the basis that his s. and s. Charter rights were breached. He changed his plea to guilty. Dismissing the application, that the evidence was admissible for the purpose of determining the admissibility of results of an analysis of a blood sample taken from a suspect for comparison purposes with a bodily substance 'found' in circumstances described in s. 487.05(b) and that because, in this case, no such bodily substance was 'found', one cannot bring these unique circumstances within the scope of s. 24(1) of the Code.","The accused was charged with the sexual assault of his 13 year old step-daughter, which led to her impregnation. Blood was drawn from the complainant and her infant daughter, as well as the accused pursuant to a warrant. The accused challenged the validity of the warrant. He contended that a warrant could only be issued for comparison purposes with a bodily substance found in circumstances described in section 487.05(b) of the Criminal Code, which, he alleged, did not include a bodily substance created by virtue of the conception of a child. Admitting the evidence, that the DNA of a baby born as a result of a sexual assault is a bodily substance for the purposes of section 487.05(b) despite the fact that the child did not exist at the time of the offence."
"The Town applied pursuant to s266 of the Municipal Government Act for the removal of a ground sign erected in the Town's downtown core zone. It was alleged that the by-laws restricted the respondents’ freedom of expression by prohibiting overly large billboard type signs and by reducing the proliferation of signs with the requirement that the signs relate to the property on which they are located. The by-law also prohibited the use of signs in the business district, minimizing the adverse impacts of signs on adjacent properties and the street scape. The Town acknowledged that the sign offended the Town’s Land Use By-law but argued that it was not necessary to regulate the erection of the signs on private property. The application was allowed and an order was issued directing the respondents to remove the ground sign. If not removed within 15 days, the Town can enter upon the land and remove the sign at the expense of the respondents. Costs to the respondents were set at $1,500.","The applicant applied for an order directing the removal of a ground sign which violated its' Municipal Planning Strategy and Land Use By-laws. The respondents argued that the applicant's by-law violated their rights under s. 2(b) of the Charter. Application allowed; respondents directed to remove the ground sign; if the sign is not removed within fifteen days, the Town can enter upon the land and remove the sign at the expense of the respondents. Although advertising is a form of expression and falls within the scope of sec. 2(b) of the Charter, the purposes of the by-laws (maintaining a distinct aesthetic character of the downtown, minimizing adverse impacts on adjacent properties and reducing safety concerns) were both pressing and substantial and the limiting measures were rationally connected to the objectives. The by-laws had a minimal impairment on the rights of the respondents, as advertising was not prohibited but only limited."
"FIAT. When the 1999 judgment was amended to provide that the primary residence of the child should be with her father, the question of the payment of maintenance by the mother was adjourned pending fulfilment of the requirement that she produce all information relating to her ability to pay maintenance and for her examination by the respondent to determine her income. HELD: The examination was completed and by agreement of counsel the questions to be resolved were whether the mother had produced all relevant financial information, and whether a trial should be directed as to the amount of maintenance payable by her. The mother's attendance at the trial was not totally supported by the evidence. Whether the mother would be required to produce her father's financial records is a matter for the Chamber to determine. Counsel for Mr. Overs submitted that since the parties' residence was in the countryside, it would not be appropriate to canvass for financial information of the father. The application for calculation of the amountof child maintenance was returned to the Chamber list for March 8, 2004. Costs to the petitioner in the amount OF $500.","FIAT: The issue to be resolved was whether the petitioner had produced all relevant financial information in order for the Court to determine the amount of maintenance to be paid by her. HELD: The application was dismissed with costs in the amount of $500 to the petitioner. Neither the petitioner's father nor the petitioner's husband was a party to the proceedings. To require them to produce their financial records, in the absence of even the slightest evidence such production would disclose anything which would in any manner assist in determining the amount of child maintenance payable by the petitioner, would be totally unjust."
"A licensed realtor appeals the finding of unprofessional conduct made by a discipline sub-committee of the Nova Scotia Real Estate Commission and the sanctions imposed, including a two year license suspension and order to pay costs of $9,980.08. The Court found that the complete inadequacy of the explanation of the suspension, and the absence of any explanation for the imposition of the other sanctions, fails to meet the standards placed on the Committee. The Committee's decision was quickly made which did not reflect the time needed to consider the totality of the evidence presented. The decision of the Commission was patently unreasonable and contrary to the principles of natural justice and fair play for an administrative board not to give reasons for its decisions.","A real estate agent sold a condominium to an American and agreed to rent it for her for a fee. He deposited a security deposit and rent in his personal account and used it for personal living expenses. When the owner inquired, he caused a false lease to be provided to her showing the rental commencing two months later than it actually did; he then failed to remit some rent and was late remitting other rent. He entered into a settlement with the owner after she complained to the Real Estate Commission but misled and did not cooperate with the Commission. At the discipline hearing, his evidence was found not credible. The Committee gave a written decision outlining the reasons for finding him guilty of five counts of professional misconduct, but failed to provide reasons for the sanctions imposed, which included a two year licence suspension and hearing costs of $10,000. The realtor appealed both the findings of professional misconduct and the sanctions imposed. Applying the standard of review of reasonableness, appeal from the findings of misconduct dismissed; applying the standard of review of correctness, appeal granted on the issue of the sanctions imposed; matter remitted back to the Committee for reconsideration, based on the principles of sanctioning outlined in the decision. It is patently unreasonable and contrary to the principles of natural justice and fair play for an administrative board not to give reasons for its decisions; reasons must be sufficiently clear, precise and intelligible as to set out the reasoning process of the tribunal and demonstrate a consideration of all of the relevant factors."
"FIAT. Nine defendants brought separate motions pursuant to Queen’s Bench Rule 41(a) for severance of the claims against them or for orders staying the claims until the plaintiffs’ claims against the Walbaum Group had been decided. The plaintiff alleged that the defendants had diverted virtually all of its assets to himself, his companies (All-Rite Plumbing, and Tamwal Investments) and his wife, Tammy Walbaum. The defendants’ evidence against all of the defendants can be adduced in no more than two and one-half days, given the number and complexity of their claims. Specific days to be designated by counsel for the plaintiffs may pertain to the evidence to be called against one, two or all three of the applicants. HELD: 1) The plaintiffs were not precluded from adducing evidence related to the Walbarge Group”s dealings with each other or required to segregate the evidence into two, three or four trials. Given the likelihood that the applicants will be required to attend portions of the trial in respect of the Walba Group in any event, severance would not necessarily result in a significant saving of time and expense. 2) The plaintiff was awarded general and special damages for pecuniary losses of approximately $20,000. 3) The defendants were relieved from attending the trial on any date not designated by them or designated by the trial judge for preparing a defence or presenting argument. 4) Costs were in the cause.","FIAT: The defendants, Sims, Garbriel and Dumurs, bring separate motions, pursuant to Queen's Bench Rule 41(a), for severance of the claims against them or for an order staying the claims against them until the plaintiffs' claim against the primary defendant, Walbaum have been heard and decided. HELD: 1) The Court will look at all of the circumstances in deciding whether to grant an application for severance.  In this case the plaintiffs should not be precluded from adducing evidence related to Walbaum's dealings with each of the applicants or required to segregate the evidence into two, three or four separate trials. Given the likelihood that the applicants will be required to attend portions of the trial in respect of the Walbaum Group in any event, severance would not necessarily result in a significant saving of time and expense.  2) The plaintiffs acknowledge that only relatively small portion of trial time (perhaps less than 1 day) will pertain to the claims against any one of the Sims, Gabriel or Dumurs. It would be unfair to require all of the applicants to participate in all of the trial when very little of it will be relevant to them. Specific dates and times should be set aside for the plaintiff to call evidence with respect to its claims against each applicant group. The applicants should be relieved from attending the trial at any other time."
"The parties married in 1995 and separated in 2006. They have four children, all of whom are now in a shared parenting arrangement. In 2008, the parties entered a separation agreement that provided for shared parenting. Since that time, the children have been primarily resident with the respondent mother. The respondent now seeks to have the spousal and child support obligations reflected in a paragraph of the 2008 separation agreement changed in as much as he seeks a corollary relief judgment that would not contain this obligation. The principal basis for the respondent's argument is that (1) a significant reduction in his income, and (2) a loss of income tax deductibility for his payment under clause 9 of the separation agreement because he is no longer in a sharing parenting arrangement because he has not met the obligation to pay $2,000 per month as required by s. 15.2(b) of the Divorce Act and (c) variation of an agreement incorporated into an order under s. 17. HELD: Application dismissed. 1) The Court's considerations are the same when called upon to set aside a separated agreement regardless of whether the application arises at the time it was issued, or in the context of an application to vary a Corollary Relief judgment. 2) There is no suggestion herein that the parties did not enter a binding agreement or that the agreement was not binding. The Agreement was registered with the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia on June 17, 2009. 3) The respondent has filed financial statements identified as Exhibit B and as Exhibit C. The petitioner filed an Answer to the Petition for Divorce. In them, the Court admits that once material change has been found, court has a wide discretion to determine what amount of support, if any, should be ordered, based solely on the factors set out in s.17(7). 4) In this case, the respondent has agreed to pay only child support based on the tables reflecting his income of approximately $30,000. The child support obligation in that circumstance would be $750 per month. 5) The petitioner acknowledges that there are arrears on the mortgage on the home and that she is at risk of losing her program of study if the husband discontinues or does not resume payment of the Spousal support.","The parties entered into an agreement and registered it with the court in 2008. It provided for a combined spousal/child support payment of $2,000/month, which the husband was able to claim on his taxes because of the shared custody arrangement they were in at the time. At the time of their divorce in 2009, the wife wanted to incorporate the agreement into the corollary relief judgment. The husband argued a dramatic drop in his income forced him to abandon the parties' shared parenting regime, which resulted in significant tax consequences and justified a change to the agreement's support provisions to include only the table amount of child support. He argued the change in circumstances was so extensive as to undermine the integrity of the agreement. The evidence showed the wife needed $2,000/month in order to keep the bank from foreclosing on the home she occupied with the children, and to allow her to finish retraining so she could enter the workforce. The husband (a self-employed financial planner) argued the recent world economic crisis had adversely affected his business to an extent unanticipated when the agreement was executed (October 2008). The evidence showed that his focus was to solicit new business rather than cut expenses to make his business more viable. He chose to spend less time with the children to do this, which impacted the children and wife. The agreement is binding; the support provisions are to be incorporated into the corollary relief judgement. This concerns an agreement registered under the Maintenance and Custody Act. It is not an application to vary under the Divorce Act, but rather an application to overturn an agreement (although the distinction doesn't impact the outcome). The terms of the agreement must be given great deference. Will enforcing it reflect the parties' original intent and be in substantial compliance with the Act? The court looked at the second branch of the test in Miglin: whether something has happened that was outside the parties' contemplation when the agreement was made. Care must be taken to distinguish between circumstances giving rise to the agreement and those making compliance difficult. Taking judicial notice, the court observed the world economic crisis was the subject of much debate before the agreement was made, even if it was more extreme than anticipated. Here, the agreement: used strong, unambiguous language; was arrived at after extensive negotiations by sophisticated parties and with the assistance of counsel; and was very important to each party. To overturn it would not be in the children's best interests: they would lose their home and their mother would be unable to finish her retraining, adversely impacting her ability to provide for them. The change in the husband's circumstances are less likely to impact the integrity of the agreement than would his proposal to disregard it. The husband cannot unilaterally alter the agreement simply by deciding to change the parenting arrangements. His decision to work additional hours and spend less time with his children was not reasonable or fair and in effect transferred the financial and parenting burden to the wife (who was also managing significant financial and professional challenges)."
"PricewaterhouseCoopers, receiver and manager of Wheatland Industries (1990) Ltd. (the plaintiff) carried on business as a farm equipment dealer at separate locations in Rosetown, Saskatchewan and Elrose, Saskatchewan. In 1999, the plaintiff entered dealership agreements with equipment suppliers, including New Holland Canada, Ltée, Case Canada Corporation and Flexi-Coil Ltd. The latter two suppliers granted the plaintiff lines of credit on the security of present and after-acquired product inventory. In 2003, the three suppliers became part of CNH Canada Ltd.(CNH Canada). In 2004, both the plaintiff and the defendant companies applied to terminate the appointment of PwC and to appoint CNH as receiver in respect of all of the assets, undertakings and properties pursuant to ss. 65(1) of the Queen’s Bench Act and ss. 64(8) of The Personal Property Security Act. In 2006 the plaintiff was in default in its obligations to TD. The defendant companies objected to the propriety of a court-appointed receiver taking the side of a competing creditor in a priority dispute amongst creditors. In the context in which the issue had arisen, this was a collateral matter which had no impact on the outcome except as to costs. HELD: 1)The contractual provisions clearly entitle the plaintiff to refuse to restock direct ship parts. 2)Ss. 50(2) and (3) serve to override the contrary contractual provisions in certain circumstances. See: Andersen (Arthur) Inc. v. Merit Energy Ltd., 2002 SKCA 105 (CanLII), 227 Sask. R. 44. The receiver, as an officer of the Court, is acting on behalf of all creditors to determine priority between competing claimants. That is not the same as the Receiver seeking to change the priorities as between the respective claimants. Parts and service manuals returned by the receiver to CNH are to be read and construed as part of the agreement. 3)The issues relate only to the interpretation of the respective priority agreements between TD and the CNH companies. There is no basis to contend that the kinds of articles involved were in any way unique. Indeed, they were commonplace articles of personal property required by a farm machinery dealer for its use and for use by its retail customers. The employment of the direct ship inventory model was supposedly for the mutual benefit of the parties. 4)The plaintiff companies argued that the priority extended to TD by paragraph 4.2 includes only assets that are not 'NHCC Financed Collateral","In 1999 the plaintiff Bank granted the defendant, Wheatland, a credit facility of $500,000 plus an additional $20,000 in Visa Credit, all financed by means of a general security agreement pledging Wheatland's present and after acquired personal property with personal guarantees from two individuals. In April 1999 the Bank registered its security interest with the Personal Property Registry (PPR). Wheatland carried on business as a farm equipment dealer. Wheatland entered into dealership agreements with equipment suppliers (CNH). The Bank entered into a priority agreement whereby the Bank postponed its interest in favour of CNH. The issue in the present application is the Bank's priority with respect to credits for returned parts. The issues require an interpretation of the respective priority agreements between the Bank and the CNH companies. HELD: 1) The critical issue is the distinction between inventory and credits paid for by Wheatland and inventory and credits financed by CNH that Wheatland has not paid for. The objective of the contracting parties when they entered the priority agreement was that the CNH security would have priority over the Bank security as to Wheatland inventory supplied by the suppliers but not paid for by Wheatland or returned for credit. But once the supplied inventory was paid for by Wheatland, the Bank's general security on Wheatland's present and after acquired property would prevail.  2) The second issue only arises as the result of the first issue. It relates to the Receiver's right to require CNH Canada to repurchase parts inventory acquired from CNH Canada or its predecessors, notwithstanding that these parts were shipped direct to Wheatland by third party suppliers at the request of CNH. The issue arises pursuant to s. 50(14)(c) of The Agricultural Implements Act (AIA). While it is obvious that the direct ship parts are contractually excluded, the question is whether the direct shipped parts in this case were 'specially ordered' by Wheatland as stipulated in s. 50(14)(c) of the Act. The direct ship parts at issue consist of very ordinary articles such as nuts and bolts, washers, O-rings, seals, gaskets and bearings. The contractual provisions entitle CNH to refuse to restock direct ship parts. However s. 50(2) and s. 50(3) override the contrary contractual provisions in certain circumstances. It appears that the contractual arrangements were intended to enable CNH to opt out of its AIA obligations to repurchase inventory from a terminated dealer. The AIA does not permit or accommodate such opting out. The provisions of s. 50 appear to be designed to protect the supplier as well as the dealer. The Court is not persuaded that the parts in this case were in any way unique or specially ordered. They were commonplace articles of personal property required by a farm machinery dealer for its use and for use by its retail customers."
"The accused was charged with possession of cocaine and marihuana for the purpose of trafficking contrary to s. 5(2) of the Controlled Drugs and Substances Act (CDSA) and he applied for an order excluding evidence of cocaine found in his motor home on the basis that his rights under ss. 8, 9 and 10 of the Charter were violated. This decision follows a voir dire held to determine the admissibility of the evidence. HELD: The evidence must be excluded. 1) The accused was unusually nervous. He asserted that his hand was trembling as he handed over his documents, that his face was trembling, his eyes were puffy and he did not display any symptoms of nervousness. 2) The evidence was excluded under s. 24(2). The Court found that the accused's right to be secure against unreasonable search or seizure under the CDSA was infringed when he was detained in his vehicle for possession of stolen property. 3) There were a number of incidents during which the accused was subject to unreasonable search and seizure. The accused raised the issue of intrusion of his personal property and privacy. His right to counsel was violated. The Court considered that his expectation of privacy in the presence of a stolen property or a stolen vehicle infringed. 4) During the course of the search, the police observed an older motor home weaving from the centre line over the fog line approximately six times. The motor home did not cross the line and was not speeding. The observed fresh black caulking around the panels and around the hood of the motor home caused the officers to observe slight movement in the area. The area around the window was clear of cigarette smoke but no alcohol. 5) The Court concluded that the observed weaving was consistent with a stolen motor vehicle. 6) The vehicle was extensively modified to facilitate the transportation of illegal drugs. Although the police cars being driven by both the accused and the driver were equipped with windshield view video cameras and audio recording devices, neither of them activated that equipment. 7) The only information that could be drawn from the vehicle's computer files was from the BC License Bureau. The Certificate containing the VIN number for the motorhome was located in a closet. The number of $20 bills with black duffel bags containing cocaine appeared on the third layer of the packaging. The vehicle contained 262 pounds of marijuana (worth between $471,000 and $733,000) in heat sealed plastic bags. Both of the accused testified that they were concerned that the driver might have been drinking and that they","The accused was charged under s. 5(2) of the Controlled Drugs and Substances Act after a highway traffic stop in which the accused was driving a motorhome that was found to be modified to carry cocaine and marijuana by a group of officers designated to search for drugs in vehicles. The cocaine found in the motorhome had an estimated street value of between 1.1 and 2.5 million dollars. The marijuana had an estimated street value between $471,000 and $733,000. The officer who stopped the motorhome saw it weave from the centre line to the fog line approximately six times. The officer testified that he suspected the driver might be impaired by alcohol. The officer stopped the vehicle and found no indicia of impairment by alcohol. The officer ran the motorhome on his computer system and found that it was registered to the driver. Another officer arrived on scene and approached the motorhome. The second officer noted a smell of fabric softener in the vehicle and testified that the accused appeared unusually nervous. The second officer testified that fabric sheets are frequently used to mask the odour of drugs. The second officer testified that he suspected the Vehicle Identification number on the dash had been tampered with because the rivets looked too new. He testified that he compared the Vehicle Identification Number on the dash to the number on the door and found they did not match. He later acknowledged that he was in error and later discovered that the numbers did match. The second officer commenced a search of the vehicle purportedly to search for paperwork that would confirm that the vehicle was not stolen. The accused was arrested for possession of stolen property. As the officer searched the vehicle, he noted signs that it had been modified. A drug sniffer dog was brought to the scene and had a positive reaction near the rear vent of the motorhome. The officers conducted a search of the vehicle which revealed that the motorhome hnd been significantly modified for the purpose of transporting illegal drugs. The accused was arrested for trafficking. The accused advised the officers that he wanted to contact a lawyer after he was arrested for trafficking. Another officer attended the scene to transport the accused to the detachment. That officer assisted with the search of the motorhome for approximately half an hour before driving the accused another hour and a half to the detachment where he was allowed to contact a lawyer. The accused argued that his rights under ss. 8, 9 and 10 of the Charter were infringed and sought exclusion under s. 24(2). HELD: Section 8 Ã» The motorhome had been extensively modified for the purpose of carrying contraband and could no longer be used as a motor home because its domestic systems had been disabled. The accused was entitled to no greater expectation of privacy in the vehicle than he would have had in any other passenger vehicle that he had the ability to regulate access to. The officers did not have a reasonable suspicion that the motorhome was stolen. The real purpose of the detention and arrest for possession of stolen property was to search the vehicle for drugs. The observations of the second officer on scene to support his reasonable suspicion that the motorhome was stolen were not capable of verification. He chose not to look at or consider the available information indicating the vehicle was not stolen including: the valid registration presented by the accused and the information from the CPIC query. Virtually all of the other observations of this officer had little to do with the possibility of a stolen vehicle and were indicators of a vehicle suspected of carrying contraband. In conducting the search, the officers were acting on little more than a hunch based on intuition. The search of the motorhome incidental to the accused's arrest for possession of stolen property amounted to a breach of s. 8. By the time the sniffer dog was deployed, the police had a reasonable suspicion that the accused was transporting drugs. However, the search of the motorhome and observations of its modifications were incidental to the arbitrary arrest of the accused for possession of stolen property, therefore, their grounds for the reasonable suspicion did not support the deployment of the sniffer dog. Section 9 Ã»  The arresting officer did not have reasonable and probable grounds to believe the motor home had been stolen when he arrested the accused. He had not carried out even a cursory investigation into the possibility that it might have been stolen. His inability to compare the two vehicle identification numbers accurately was willful blindness or flagrantly negligent. The accused was arbitrarily detained when he was arrested for possession of stolen property. The observations that lead to the reasonable and probable grounds to arrest the accused for trafficking were derived from his arbitrary arrest for possession of stolen property. The detention had little practical effect on the accused because he remained confined to the back of the police car as a result of the earlier arrest for possession of stolen property. Section 10 Ã»  The accused was not provided with an opportunity to retain and instruct counsel in a timely fashion. However, the police did not attempt to elicit any incriminating evidence from the accused during the time it took to get him to the detachment to call a lawyer. There is no causal connection between the breach of the accused's rights under s. 10(b) and the discovery of the drugs. The evidence was excluded under s. 24(2). The breaches of the accused's rights under ss. 8 and 9 were very serious. The officer was so determined to find evidence of contraband that he became blinded to the constitutional requirements of a reasonable suspicion for investigative detention and reasonable and probable grounds for arrest. His actions showed a flagrant disregard for Charter requirements. The deprivation of liberty and privacy resulting from the breaches was significant but not egregious. These two factors favor excluding the evidence. The charge is a serious one and involves a large quantity of drugs. The evidence is highly reliable and critical to the Crown's case. The truth seeking function of the Court favours admitting the evidence. On balance, the administration of justice would be brought into disrepute if the evidence was admitted and that standard is paramount."
"The appellant was convicted of robbery and sentenced to four years' imprisonment. She alleged that the trial judge erred in law by treating the conflicting Crown and defence evidence as a credibility contest. She also appealed her conviction for strangling the victim, alleging that the appellant removed the victim's money from his wallet and choked the victim until he passed out. Appeal dismissed; the judge did not fall into the trap of simply comparing the Crown and the defence positions without then going on to assess the whole of the evidence to establish proof of guilt beyond reasonable doubt. In assessing all the evidence, the judge recognized that the ultimate issue was not credibility, but proof to criminal standard.","The defendant, who was in a very small apartment with two other individuals, got up from the couch and proceeded through a doorway behind the complainant, purportedly to use the bathroom. A few minutes later, the complainant found something wrapped around his neck and he was choked until he passed out. When he regained consciousness, he was lying on the floor with the defendant crouched over him. She left without saying a word and he later discovered that money was missing from his wallet, which he found under his back. The defendant was convicted of robbery when the complainant maintained that the third person in the room never left his sight and was still seated directly in front of him when he felt something being tightened around his throat. Although the third person's testimony supported the complainant's evidence, the defendant alleged that while she was in the bathroom, she heard a commotion and when she came out she saw the complainant lying on the floor and the other individual stated that she 'had the money' as she ran out the door. Not knowing what to do, she crouched over the complainant and lifted his head to see if he was okay. When he came to and said he was going to call the police, she ran because she was afraid of having her parole revoked. She appealed the conviction on the basis that the trial judge had erred in treating the conflicting Crown and defence evidence as a credibility contest. Appeal dismissed;  it was clear that the trial judge had accepted the complainant's evidence as to what had occurred along with the other witness' evidence as to who had strangled him and rejected the defendant's testimony and denials of responsibility. Although he did not specifically refer to the principles in R. v. Wry (1991) (SCC), the court was satisfied he recognized their importance and did not fall into the trap of simply comparing the Crown and defence positions without assessing the whole of the evidence. The complainant never wavered in his evidence that the other individual had never left his sight and was still seated directly in front of him when he felt something being tightened around his throat, which was supported by the other individual's testimony."
The applicant landlord appealed a Small Claims Court adjudicator's decision to not grant declaratory relief. The applicant sought to have the adjudicator hear an interlocutory appeal of a Director of Residential Tenancies decision. The adjudicator did not have the jurisdiction to hear the application of the applicant on the basis that he was hearing an appeal of the respondent's order for a review of rental increase. The small claims court granted the appeal and ordered the applicant to pay the sum of $50 to Dalhousie Legal Aid on the issue of whether or not the affidavit was properly before the Court on the merits of the appeal. Application for reinstatement of the right to appeal under s. 32 of the Small Claims Act was dismissed.,"A small claims adjudicator determined he had jurisdiction to hear the respondent's application for a review of his rent increase. He adjourned the matter and asked that it return to him for a hearing on the merits. The appellant appealed. At issue was whether the appeal was properly before the court or premature. There was also an issue concerning the admissibility of an affidavit that wasn't before the adjudicator at the original proceeding. Appeal dismissed and matter returned for a continuation of the hearing on the merits before the same adjudicator. The court has no jurisdiction to hear an appeal on an interlocutory decision of this nature. There can be no appeal from the Small Claims Court until a final determination is made. Until this matter is decided on its merits, there has been no final determination. There are sound policy, as well as practical, reasons for this approach."
The accused was charged with two counts under the Controlled Drugs and Substances Act and one count of possession of cocaine for the purposes of trafficking. The police observed the transaction from an observation post less than 130 feet from the incident and from a position of some elevation. Constable Marriott had the use of expensive binoculars to view the encounter. The accused denied having stashed the drugs in the rock wall. HELD: The Court found the accused guilty of both counts. The Court was satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt that the accused stashed these drugs in a rock wall after the transaction and that he did so minutes before his arrest. The evidence respecting the cutting substances in crack cocaine constituted enough cocaine to supply the accused with his next transaction. It was also concluded that the gesturing to another place for the deal to take place was common practice in street level drug trafficking.,"The accused was charged with trafficking in cocaine and possession of cocaine for the purposes of trafficking. He was arrested within minutes of two officers observing what they believed to be a drug transaction. After watching the accused roam the street, they had observed him meet up and speak briefly with another person, whom he motioned to follow him and they proceeded by different routes, meeting up at the rear corner of a building. Although the area was dimly lit, one of the officers saw the accused remove something from a small pink plastic bag, which he then placed in the other person's hand. The encounter was very brief and neither officer observed any money exchanged. A ball of crack cocaine was later seized from the other person's jacket pocket. Although no drugs were found on the accused, a search of the area located a pink baggy of drugs stashed in a rock wall close to ground level. The defence argued that the drugs seized from the other person could have come from anywhere and constructive possession had not been proven with respect to the baggy located in the wall. Accused found guilty on both counts; the court accepted that the drugs found in the wall belonged to him and his possession was constructive, done knowingly for his use and benefit so he could return to the stash for his next transaction. The encounter described was consistent with low level street trafficking (brief and direct contact between buyer and seller, the passing communication and gesture to go to another place to avoid police scrutiny and the frequent disposal of the remaining drugs by stashing) and inconsistent with any other possible explanation. Moments after handing something to the other person, the accused's silhouette was observed in the area where the drugs were stashed and the court was satisfied that he had placed the drugs in the wall minutes before his arrest."
"The applicants applied for solicitor client costs or in the alternative costs under Tariff 'C' to which they say a multiplier of four should be applied for a total of $12,000 costs plus disbursements. The Bowsers, who were seeking mandatory injunction and permanent injunction as well as damages for the loss of use and enjoyment of their properties, requested costs on a solicitor client basis. Rule 77.01(1)(a) and 77.02(1) of the New Rules make it clear that the winning party in the litigation is presumptively entitled to partial compensation of their expenses of litigation. Customarily this has been viewed as substantial, but not complete, indemnification of the expenses of the dispute in this case concerns to what extent there should be partial compensation. The dispute started in May 2011 and was generally conducted in civil fashion. Ultimately the Sheas, by omitting some important information in making their claim, undermined the strength of their claim. This should not be seen as outrageous, scandalous or reprehensible conduct.","Rule 77.03 – Liability for costsThe court found in favor of the respondents after a half-day chambers hearing. They sought solicitor-client costs or costs under Tariff C, with a multiplier of four for a total of $12,000 given the applicants' conduct and their failure to include important information in their claim. Held, party-and-party costs of $6,000 awarded to the respondents, using Tariff C and a multiplier of two. This matter was sufficiently complex and important to the parties that it required significant preparation and effort to prepare/review the evidence and conduct the hearing. While they did omit relevant information, the applicants' conduct wasn't so outrageous, scandalous or reprehensible that it warranted an award of solicitor-client costs. The dispute was acrimonious, but the litigation was generally conducted in a civil manner."
"The 19 year old appellant pled guilty in Provincial Court to three charges of dangerous driving causing bodily harm. He sought leave to appeal and appeals from his sentence of nine months incarceration plus two years probation on each charge, to be served concurrently. The charges arose out of an information alleging that the appellant, who had an argument with his girlfriend at her home, had been driving with his headlights off. He was charged and plead guilty. Three Criminal Code convictions and a driving prohibition had been imposed on him pursuant to s. 249(3) of the Code. An appeal of the sentence was granted on the basis that it was manifestly excessive. Dismissing the appeal, that the trial judge is not bound by the recommendations of Crown counsel or a joint submission resulting from a plea bargain.","After an argument with his girlfriend, the appellant drove his car at high speed with the lights off, running two stop signs. At the second intersection he collided with another vehicle, causing serious injury to three people. He pleaded guilty to three counts of dangerous driving causing bodily harm; the Crown proposed an intermittent sentence, but the judge sentenced him to nine months incarceration concurrent on each count plus two years probation with conditions. The appellant appealed on the grounds the judge failed to consider the Crown's recommendation, failed to sufficiently state his reasons, and the sentence was excessive. Dismissing the appeal, that the sentencing power of a judge is not limited by Crown submissions, that the failure to state every reason does not constitute and error, and that in view of the appellant's record and other factors, the sentence was not excessive to the point of constituting a reversible error."
"The Crown appeals the imposition of a 6 month conditional sentence with 45 months probation and a restitution order against the respondent for the offence of stealing money in excess of $5,000 contrary to s.334(a). The maximum allowable probation period is 3 years. The sentence imposed below is unenforceable. HELD: A restitution order pursuant to s738 in the amount of $8,518 be paid directly to the respondent. The terms of the probation order are affirmed save and except condition which is amended to read: Pay Restitution in the sum of $200 to Mr. Hal Schmidt, c/o Family Pizza, S7N 1Z3 at the rate of at least $200 per month commencing December 1, 1997 until the full amount is paid.  1) Clearly the maximum allowable sentence is three years and therefore the sentence imposed is invalid. 2) The appeal is allowed. The order is made.","The Crown appealed the six month conditional sentence with 45 months probation and a restitution order for the offence of stealing money in excess of $5,000 contrary to s334(a). HELD: The appeal was allowed and the following ordered: a restitution order payable directly to the employer in the amount of $8,528; the six month conditional sentence was affirmed with the conditions as originally ordered plus restitution was to be paid in full at a rate of $200 per month; the period of probation was decreased to three years following the expiration of the six month conditional sentence. The maximum allowable probation period is three years and the sentence imposed was therefore unenforceable."
"FIAT. The defendant sought an order pursuant to Queen's Bench Rule 547 requiring the plaintiffs to post security for its costs in this action on the grounds that Wind Power Inc. was a non-resident plaintiff with little or no assets in the province of Saskatchewan and Dove Industries was a corporation which wasincorporated specifically for a wind power demonstration project which did not have funds or assets in Saskatchewan and accordingly had little assets in that province. HELD: The application was dismissed. 1)There were appropriate circumstances in Thole v. McKenna (1988), 48 C.P.C. 150 (Ont. S.C.) for the Court to direct security for costs at this stage of the action. 2)The plaintiff was advised of the plaintiffs' position and held the matter in suspense before resorting to the present application. 3)The delay was not necessarily fatal to the applicant's motion. To make an award for security at this time would place a burden on the plaintiffs and possibly prevent the action from taking place at the scheduled time.","FIAT. SaskPower sought an order pursuant to Queen's Bench Rule 547 to require the plaintiffs to post security for costs on the ground Wind Power was a non-resident plaintiff with little or no assets in the province of Saskatchewan. HELD: The motion was dismissed.  1)Rule 547 is limited to cases where the plaintiff is a non-resident or where the defendant is given a statutory right to apply. Wind Power is an Alberta company extra-provincially registered in Saskatchewan. Dove Industries, a Saskatchewan company incorporated specifically to develop a pilot project in Saskatchewan which did not proceed, had shareholders in the province. 2)Given the amount of the claim against SaskPower in the amount of $6,400,000 and the significant claim for costs in excess of $50,000 the Court would have granted the security for costs but for the delay by SaskPower in bringing its application. The action was commenced in April 1996. Unexplained delay by a defendant in seeking security for costs will prevent the grant of an order. To make an award for security for costs at this stage would place a burden on the plaintiffs and possibly prevent the action from taking place at the scheduled time.  3)The plaintiff was awarded one set of costs in any event of the cause."
The application for the stated case was dismissed without costs. The Court declined to answer the questions the Board submitted concerning the interpretation of provisions of the Workers' Compensation Act.,"The Workers' Compensation Board applied, by way of stated case, to have the Court answer questions with respect to the interpretation of certain provisions of the Workers' Compensation Act. There were 40 questions in total. The Court was asked to relate the questions to 19 factual summaries presented by the Board concerning cases before it. The Court was required to decide whether the questions were the proper subject matter of a stated case. Dismissing the stated case application, that the questions submitted are hypothetical and speculative. They are therefore inappropriate questions for a stated case, which requires that questions must be responsive to the facts and must not be speculative."
"An application pursuant to Queen's Bench Rules 664(1) and 674 for an order quashing a decision of the Office of the Rentalsman. HELD: The preliminary objection by counsel for the respondent to the application is dismissed and the local registrar is instructed to return the matter to chambers' list on August 19, 1999 to hear argument on the merits and to allow counsel for each respondents an opportunity to file material. There is nothing in the Act which allows this Court to extend the time for filing an appeal. To deny the applicant an opportunity here would be to deny her only remedy in the circumstances.","The applicant sought an Order quashing a decision of the Office of the Rentalsman pursuant to Queen's Bench Rule 664(1) and 674. The respondent raised a preliminary objection, arguing that the matter should not proceed by way of judicial review but that the applicant should be restricted to an appeal of the Rentalsman's decision under s.49(1) of the Residential Tenancies Act, and that the applicant had failed to do so within the prescribed 30 day limit. The applicant argued that she never received any notice of proceedings making it impossible for her to appeal within 30 days. HELD: Preliminary objection dismissed. The court ordered that the application be returned to the Chamber's list for a hearing on the merits. Since there is nothing in the Act that allows the court to extend the time for filing an appeal, to deny the application for judicial review would deny the applicant an opportunity to pursue her only remedy in the circumstances."
"The appellant appealed from a probate decision which found that he had committed a flagrant breach of fiduciary obligations owed him as executor of the estate. The appellant had made a number of specific bequests, including a bequest of $50,000 to her niece and $10,000 for the Zion Lutheran Church. The deceased had died in September 1997 and the appellant applied to the Acting Registrar of Probate to have his executors accounts examined and approved. At the request of counsel for the main legatees, the Acting registrar ordered all estate money be paid into an estate bank account. The respondent appealed. Appeal dismissed; the appeal was not directed at the appellant but at the respondent; the respondent was completely justified in ordering his executor's file to be delivered to the court. The appeal was entirely justified in considering the grounds advanced by the appellant in this case. The Court found no error of law, or principle, with respect to the issues before him and found that the appeal had been brought for the sole purpose of delaying the legateees from pursuing their legitimate rights and that this proceeding was an abuse of the appeal process.","One of the residual legatees of the respondent estate filed a petition under s. 31(1) of the Probate Act. At the hearing on the application, the executor, under cross-examination, admitted that he had 'done a disservice to the estate' and that his actions were a 'perfect example of why executors shouldn't have done what I have done.' The Chambers judge found that the executor converted estate funds to his own use and ordered the appellant to post security pursuant to the Act. The executor appealed. He submitted that the Court had not explicitly determined that he had committed waste, and accordingly there was no basis or foundation for an order requiring him to post security. Dismissing the appeal, that the appellant's own admissions under oath were sufficient bases for the Court's finding. This was also one of those rare occasions where solicitor and client costs on the appeal were warranted, as the executor's actions amounted to a serious dereliction of duty which the Court termed reprehensible and unconscionable."
"The applicant applied to vary the February 1, 1995 consent judgment by terminating or significantly reducing his obligation to pay further spousal support. The amount he was required to pay under the 1995 judgment was $2,500 per month. The application was triggered by the applicant's loss of employment and a debilitating leg injury. HELD: 1)There was no merit in the wait-and-see suggestion of the respondent. The applicant had retired and had no intention to become re-employed. It was essential that he know now what his future obligations were.  2)The applicant had met the threshold for a variation application by demonstrating that there had been a material change in circumstances since the original order was last revised. Although this entitles him to have the Court review his obligation pursuant to s15.2 of the Divorce Act, it does not follow that his obligation should be terminated. It is significant that the agreement reached by the parties in 1995 did not provide that there was either a time limited or that it was to be varied if there was a substantial change in the future financial positions of the parties. Surely at the time the agreement was made, the parties had contemplated their eventual retirement and the financial consequences that it would have for each of them. Yet it is not likely that the parties intended to continue spousous support to continue indefinitely at the rate set out in the consent divorce judgment. 3)The respondent had devoted her full time to raising their three children and received Canada Pension Plan and Old Age Security benefits. She resisted any reduction in excess of her pension benefits until the applicant could establish that he would not in fact have any employment income. She suggested that he could also supplement his own income by selling his residence and purchasing some form of annuity.","The applicant sought to vary the 1995 consent judgment by terminating or significantly reducing spousal support of $2,500 per month. The respondent suggested the reduction should be limited to the amount she now received from her old age pension and CPP. Neither wanted a trial of the issue and submissions were primarily confined to the financial information filed. HELD: On-going spousal support was reduced to $1,750 per month from April until March 1, 2001 and $1,250 thereafter.  1)It is clear from Bracklow that each case involving spousal support must be determined on its own facts. The court must give due consideration to all the factors and objectives of a spousal support order set out in s.15.2 of the Divorce Act rather than focusing on one factor alone, such as income levels or self sufficiency.  2)There had been a material change in circumstances as the applicant, now 62, had lost his employment and suffered a debilitating leg injury while the respondent, now 67, was receiving an old age pension. 3)The 1995 agreement did not provide spousal support was either time limited or that it was to be varied if there was a substantial change in their future financial positions. However, it was unlikely the parties intended spousal support to continue indefinitely at $2,500 per month even after the applicant retired. The respondent was disadvantaged by the traditional marriage to a greater degree than the applicant as she devoted her full time to working in the home. She received her full share of their joint efforts in the form of an equal division of the matrimonial property. The economic benefits and disadvantages that flow from the marriage and its dissolution must be taken into account (Moge). There was no merit in the wait-and-see suggestion of the respondent. 4)No costs."
The appellants appealed their convictions for two offences under the Excise Tax Act. The provisions of the Act provide for an implicit scheme of delegation of authority to be exercised by someone specifically designated by the Minister pursuant to the regulations. The Act does not set out a separate offence but merely clarifies the circumstances under which a director can be convicted of the same offence as a party. There was no error by the trial judge in finding that the returns purportedly filed were not merely defective but did not qualify as returns at all. The appellants had filed blank returns. The trial judge found as a fact that there was no information relating to GST in any of the documents filed. The notice simply required a taxpayer to comply with the statutory requirements of the act. The fact that the true copy of the notice annexed to the affidavit of service contains a facsimile signature is of no moment.,"An appeal of convictions on two offences under the Excise Tax Act. Grounds for the appeal were summarized as lack of jurisdiction to proceed because of alleged defects in the summons; alternatively, the appellants were not properly advised of the charges they were facing contrary to s.11(a) of the Charter; Kimery should not have been convicted of an offence contrary to s.330 when the information set out an offence contrary to s.326 of the Excise Tax Act; there was no evidence to justify a finding that the Goods and Services Tax returns were not filed; unreasonable delay compromised their right to a fair trial; the demand for a return which was filed was invalid as there was no proof that it was signed by a person authorized to sign on the Minister's behalf. HELD: The appeal was dismissed. 1)Any defects as to the form or service of the summons were unimportant. The record clearly indicated the appellants appeared, pleaded and proceeded with the trial and made no objection. Kimery never requested an adjournment nor was there any suggestion that he desired to be represented by counsel. There was nothing to suggest he was confused or misled by the proceedings or that he did not understand the nature of the charges the appellants were facing. The trial judge did everything required of him in the circumstances. 2)Section 330 does not set out a separate offence but merely clarifies the circumstances under which a director can be convicted of the same offence as a party. This is no different than the situation of an accused being charged with a substantive offence under the Criminal Code on the theory that he is a party by virtue of s.21 of the Criminal Code. Kimery was sole director of the corporation during the period in question when the returns were required to be filed. It was open to the trial judge to find he must have directly participated in or at least acquiesced in the failure to file the appropriate GST returns. 3)There was evidence to support the finding that the appellants failed to file returns as required by s.326. The appellants filed blank returns. The trial judge found as a fact that there was no information relating to GST in any of the documents.  It was agreed the returns were not merely defective but did not qualify as returns at all. 4)The appellants were not denied the right to a trial within a reasonable time as required by Charter s.11(b). Pre-charge delay is not a factor which can be taken into account at this stage. The appellant, having failed to rectify the omission after reasonable opportunities, could not now say they were somehow prejudiced. Once charges were laid, the matter proceeded to trial within a reasonable time.  5)The decision in R. v. Swyryda is a complete answer to the argument that the field position of 'Director Tax Services Office' was not authorized to exercise the powers and perform the duties of the Minister. Also, s.24(2) of the Interpretation Act gives implied powers to persons acting under the authority of a minister of any Crown department over which that minister resides to undertake any act or do anything on behalf of the minister if that person is acting in a capacity appropriate to do the act or thing. Section 24(2) appears to be a codification of the common law, frequently referred to as the Carltona principle based upon the 1943 English case, and followed in R. v. Harrison where the SCC held that responsible and experienced officials will have the ability to exercise the Minister's authority in accomplishing Ministerial duties. The service of the demand in this case was not part of an explicit statutory or regulatory scheme of delegation. It falls under an implicit scheme of delegation and sub-delegation as allowed at common law and in accordance with the Federal Interpretation Act.  The execution and service of a demand to file a GST return is purely an administrative act.  It does not require the exercise of Ministerial discretion nor does it deprive any citizen of any right by restricting a right to appeal. The notice simply requires a taxpayer to comply with the statutory requirements of the Act. The fact that the true copy of the notice annexed to the affidavit of service contains a facsimile signature is not significant."
"This was an appeal by a supplier from the refusal by a receiver to release goods to the supplier pursuant to s. 81.1 of the Bankruptcy and Insolvency Act. The single issue was whether the judge erred in finding that the goods were subject to an agreement for sale at arms' length at the time the supplier presented a written demand for repossession. The fact that it intended to supply certain materials did not give rise to a contractual obligation to provide those particular materials. It follows that, as of the date of the supplier's demand, these books were not'subject to any sale for sale' within the meaning of s.81.1(1)(c)(v) and that the appellant shall pay the respondent costs fixed at $1500 inclusive of disbursements.","A supplier delivered computer books to an educational institution prior to the appointment of a receiver for the institution. Immediately after the appointment of the receiver, the supplier presented a written demand for repossession of the books. The receiver refused, claiming that the books were subject to an agreement for sale to the institution's students and therefore, exempt.  A judge of the Supreme Court agreed and the supplier appealed. Appeal allowed; return of books or payment of their value to the supplier ordered. Although the goods were supplied as course materials, the institution's contract with its students obliged it to provide, in its discretion, textbooks and courseware needed for the program and the students acknowledged that it was necessary for the institution to change materials from time to time. The books had not been distributed to the students as of the date of the supplier's demand. The fact that the institution intended to supply certain materials did not give rise to a contractual obligation to provide these particular materials. Thus, the books were not subject to any agreement for resale within the meaning of the Act."
"This appeal is from an order made by a Queen's Bench judge prohibiting McMurtry from continuing as trial judge in respect of criminal charges against the respondent Herzberg. Herzberg was charged with impaired driving, driving with a blood-alcohol level exceeding.08 and dangerous driving. He moved for a stay of proceedings on the grounds that the Crown had failed to provide adequate disclosure. In response, the Crown filed an affidavit to show that disclosure had been made. The respondent applied to the court for an order of prohibition. HELD: The appeal is allowed and the matter is remitted to Provincial Court for trial. 1)There is abundant authority that disclosure of an accused's criminal record to the Court, whether composed of a judge and jury or a jury alone, does not amount to an automatic disqualification of the court on the ground of apprehended bias, appearance of bias or other prejudice to the accused. Although it is the presiding judge to ensure a fair hearing, there is no law which guarantees that inadvertent, inadmissible evidence will not be introduced. If an error of that nature should occur, the error should be ignored, or, if it is deemed too significant to be ignored by the judge, a mistrial will be declared. 2)The respondent said that she had not read the record. She was not biased as a result of the information tendered at the pre-trial proceedings and that the record was something she could put out of her mind as she put out her mindas she did in all instances where she ruled evidence in admissible. In these circumstances she was correct to dismiss the application for stay and to decline to recuse herself.","The accused applied for a stay of proceedings on the ground the Crown failed to provide adequate disclosure. In making disclosure, the Crown appended a copy of the respondent's criminal record to its affidavit. The defence then applied for a stay on the ground of perception of bias on the part of the Provincial Court judge because the respondent's criminal record was before her. The Crown appealed the order which prohibited the judge from continuing as trial judge in respect to the respondent's criminal charges of impaired driving, driving with blood alcohol levels exceeding .08, and dangerous driving. HELD: The appeal was allowed. The order for prohibition was quashed and the matter was remitted to the Provincial Court for trial. There is abundant authority that disclosure of an accused's criminal record to the court alone does not amount to an automatic disqualification of the court on the ground of apprehended bias, appearance of bias or other prejudice to the accused. The judgment in R. v. Peters is almost directly on point. The judge in this case said she had not read the record, she was not biased as a result of the information tendered at the pre-trial proceedings and the record was something she could put out of her mind as she did in all instances where she ruled evidence inadmissible. She was correct in these circumstances to dismiss the application for a stay and to decline to recluse herself."
"FIAT. The father of one child applied to reduce his child support obligation and rescind arrears which had accumulated under an order of Archambault J. dated March 6, 1996. He was ordered to pay $600 per month as support for the child. The mother was underemployed and, since the father had not obtained full-time employment, she was also required to pay retroactive child support. HELD: 1) On all of the evidence it is the father's choice to work a minimum amount each year and, if he should return to school, it will be his choice to either pay full time or with a retroactive variation. 2) The father's decision to work only 3 months of the year and/or return to the school is not a reasonable decision when he has a continuing obligation to provide support for his child, Stephanie. It is very likely that Mr. Pilat's financial position has not changed as result of the order for child support and he has not made a serious effort to locate employment. 3) The mother's request for discovery to determine the amount of income to be imputed to the father was not made lightly. It was clear that the substantial delays in this proceeding were primarily the result of his unwillingness to provide adequate financial disclosure.  4) The applicant's income for the purpose of this variation application was $40,000. Based on his gross annual income of $39,000, he should pay $328 per month in child support based on $1,326 per month for the support of Stephanie and $84 per month based upon advanced extracurricular expenses in the annual sum of $2,000 for the student. The applicant did not provide any financial disclosure to the court.","FIAT: In 1996, the respondent was ordered to pay $600 per month as child support for his daughter. He now applies to reduce his support obligation and rescind the arrears which have accumulated. HELD: 1) In 1999, the respondent sold his ownership interest in a business and retained a one-third interest. In 2001, he was terminated from his full-time employment as a result of an unexplained absence from work after he received a suspension for insubordination. Since his termination, he has not obtained full-time employment. He has continued to work seasonally 3 months a year and earn the gross amount of $21,000. The Court found that it is the respondent's choice to work a minimum amount each year. It has been said that individuals, who are subject to support obligations, are entitled to make decisions in relation to their careers as long as the decisions are reasonable at the time having regard to the circumstances. The respondent's decision to work only three months a year and to possibly return to school is not reasonable. 2) For the purposes of this application, the respondent's income was imputed to be $40,000 and he was ordered to pay $328 per month as support for his daughter. 3) The sharing of the s. 7 special expenses should be based on the respondent's imputed income. 4) A retroactive variation of child support is warranted. The respondent commenced his application for variation in June 2002 and the chambers judge was of the view that any variation of support should be retroactive to September 2002.  In light of the fact the respondent's previous support obligation was tax deductible/tax inclusive, the petitioner may in fact benefit from a retroactive variation as the child support she will receive, pursuant to this order, will be payable on a net of tax basis.  5) Rule 608(2) provides that a successful party will be entitled to costs of a family law proceeding unless, pursuant to Rule 608(3), the successful party has behaved unreasonably or has acted in bad faith. The difficulty in the matter before me is determining whether or not the respondent has been successful. Although his support obligation decreases, his previous payment was tax deductible while his ongoing payment will be net of tax. It is very likely that the respondent's financial position has not changed as a result of the order. The Court also had grave concerns respecting the substantial delays in the proceedings caused by the respondent's unwillingness to provide financial disclosure. Costs were awarded to the petitioner in the sum of $750, as the discovery motion would not have been necessary had the respondent provided appropriate financial disclosure."
"The Court of Appeal dismissed the application for an order for costs. The Court found no tenable basis for interfering with the trial judge's decision to grant custody of the 2 year old son of the father to his father. The Father had not previously been regular access to the Child. HELD: The Appeal was dismissed. The award of maintenance was not unreasonable having regard for the length of the relationship (15 years), the husband'swage (approximately $55,000 per year) and the fact that the wife had seldom worked outside the home. The trial judge also chose to accept the testimony of an expert witness who testified as to relationships within the family. Further dislocation in the child's living arrangements and schooling would be detrimental to the child.","Appeal from [1993]TWL QB93106 QB93p55. HELD: There was no tenable basis for interfering with the trial judge's decision to award custody to the father. An award of $700.00 a month spousal support was not unreasonable having regard for (i) the length of the relationship (approximately fifteen years), (ii) the husband's wage (approximately $55,000.00 per year) and (iii) the fact that the wife had seldom worked outside the home."
"The applicant sought to have a solicitor be barred from acting for the plaintiff by reason of a conflict of interest. The solicitor had been active in representing the defendant Crown corporation prior to 1991 when the defendant changed solicitors. This action was commenced after the change of solicitors and there was no suggestion that the contractual issues giving rise to the cause of action were ever the subject of any consultation between the defendant and its former solicitor. HELD: The application was dismissed. 1)The applicant was being consistent with a prior ruling involving a asimilar attempt to displace the solicitor's present solicitors from certain litigation then existing following the 1982 change of government. 2)The solicitor was not a member of that firm and had not been involved in any of the contractual matters before 1991. 3)Although the confidential nature of a solicitor's work and the manner in which it was managed may have given the applicant a different perspective on the subject matter of the action, the situation in this case was exactly the same as decided in 1993 in a similar application respecting another solicitor of the same firm.",The applicant sought to have the law firm barred from acting for the plaintiff because a member of that firm had been active in representing the defendant prior to 1991 when the defendant changed lawyers following a change in government. This action was commenced after the change of solicitors and there was no suggestion that the subject matter of the action was ever the subject of any consultation between the defendant and its former solicitors. The applicant raised arguments about the confidential nature of its adjusting and investigation of loss claims and internal policy procedures and litigation strategies in relation to the denial of claims. HELD: The application was dismissed with costs to the respondent in any event of the cause. 1)In 1993 in a similar application respecting another member of the same law firm the judge ruled against the plaintiff. This was consistent with a similar attempt following the 1982 change of government.  2)The only identifiable strategy (or perhaps a tactic) adopted to date has been excessive delay requiring applications to force compliance with the Rules and two applications to deprive the plaintiff of its chosen legal representation. 3)Once it is determined that there is no actual knowledge of the case in question the onus to establish the existence of confidential information shifts to the party asserting the concern. 4)As the applicant is a public corporation it is doubtful it has or should have secret strategies with which to defeat persons claiming under its insurance scheme. It is entitled to have its own preordained policies in respect of disputed claims but if such policies exist they probably should be made known to the public for whose benefit the corporation exists. Also such policies may well have changed since 1992.
"The plaintiff purchased a medical insurance policy from the defendant, Medical Services Incorporated for the period of time he expected to reside in Chicago, Illinois, U.S.A. pursuing studies in optometry. HELD: The plaintiff was awarded $26,864.46 for pneumothorax, collapsed lung, and costs to be taxed. 1)The definition of a 'pre-existing condition' is not clear and does not operate to relieve MSI of its obligation to pay. 2)The evidence of the two qualified physicians who treated Hurd in Chicago was not clear. Neither doctor detected or made mention that they even suspected bleb, which could have resulted in a condition pre-existing the policy. 3)Travel was dangerous and put Hurd's life in jeopardy. The Court found that Hurd was unable to return to Saskatchewan for surgery. 4)The term of insurance exempts MSI from payment because of a condition existing the effective date of the policy (the exclusionary clause). The fact that the surgery was medically necessary and was necessarily performed in Chicago could result in a recurrence. 5)The Court rejected the argument that it was unnecessary to postpone the surgery because of the unconfirmed existence of bleb. 6)The terms of the insurance policy exempted MSI from liability for payment of the plaintiff's claim. 7)The plaintiff will have judgment for the sum of $26k.46 prayed for in this action together with costs of taxed.","The plaintiff purchased a medical insurance policy from MSI for the time he expected to reside in the USA pursuing studies. The policy did not cover the periods he would be in Saskatchewan where he ordinarily resided with his parents. The plaintiff suffered chest pain following a water-skiing accident in August 1997 in Saskatchewan and underwent a thoracostomy for a collapsed lung while in Saskatchewan. He underwent a further thoracotomy in February 1998 while in the USA. MSI denied coverage arguing the plaintiff should have postponed the operation and returned to Saskatchewan for the surgery and that, in any event, the condition pre-existed the purchase of the insurance policy. The medical reports agreed that surgery was necessary. They also agreed it could be postponed for a time but there was disagreement over the length of any postponement or the patient's ability to travel home given the circumstance of a collapsed lung and the suspected but unconfirmed existence of a bleb. HELD: The plaintiff was awarded $26,864.46 plus costs, to be taxed. 1)The evidence that travel was dangerous and put the plaintiff's life in jeopardy was accepted. Therefore the plaintiff was unable to return to Saskatchewan for the surgery. 2)The exclusionary clause did not exempt MSI from liability for payment. The definition of a 'pre-existing condition' is not clear and does not operate to relieve MSI of its obligation under the policy to extend the benefits in question. The policy was in effect from August 1, 1997 to July 31, 1998. It was not raised in a letter confirming the dates of his coverage sent after the plaintiff had experienced the pneumothorax of which MSI had been informed."
"FIAT: This is an application pursuant to the Inter-jurisdictional Support Orders Act (I-10.03) by Ms. [V.G.B.] for a declaration of paternity and child support. HELD: 1) The parties never lived together but had an intimate relationship which resulted in the birth of a child. 2) The child's current income is below the amount normally required for Table support. 3) The onus is on the applicant to establish that any continued unemployment is unintentional or if intentional, that it is reasonable in the circumstances and does not warrant the imputation of income.  4) The applicant must lead cogent evidence to establish why the table amount would cause undue hardship. The only issue is whether the Court can impute income to him pursuant to s. 19(1)(a) of the Guidelines on the basis he is intentionally under-employed or unemployed. The evidence in this case does not support a finding of intentional unemployment. The parties' financial situation do not warrant such a finding. 5) The application involves a three-step process. The first step is to determine whether the child support order should be set higher or lower. The court must advise the child's mother within 30 days of the order whether he obtained employment or a contract position with the provincial government and, if so, his remuneration from that position.","This was an application pursuant to The Inter-jurisdictional Support Orders Act for a declaration of paternity and child support. HELD: By agreement there was an order pursuant to s. 45 of The Children's Law Act, 1997 declaring the respondent the biological father of the child. The respondent does not currently earn sufficient income to pay child support. He was to advise the petitioner within 30 days if he receives an offer of employment or contract and if so, the terms of his employment including his gross income. 1) The respondent's ability to earn income is limited by his health to sedentary types of employment. There is no suggestion or evidence that his pursuit of education is unreasonable.  2) An individual who chooses to be underemployed or unemployed to avoid paying child support is 'intentionally underemployed or unemployed'. That is not the only circumstance envisioned by s. 19(1)(a) of the Guidelines. The Court adopted the reasoning of the Manitoba Court of Appeal in Donovan v. Donovan and the Ontario Court of Appeal in Drygala v. Pauli and found that 'intentional' extends to situations where a parent required to pay child support chooses, for whatever reason, to earn less than they are capable of earning. The fact that the parent chooses to be underemployed or unemployed, brings their situation within the meaning of 'intentional' and creates the circumstances envisioned by s. 19(1)(a). The reason for such a choice does not change the fact it is intentional, but it may impact on the Court's decision whether to exercise its discretion and impute income."
"Cst. Olberg applied for and obtained two Saskatchewan search warrants pursuant to s. 487 of the Criminal Code and s. 11 of the Controlled Drugs and Substances Act. The search of the accused's residence was the culmination of an investigation that had begun many months earlier. These investigations were outlined in and the subject matter of two Informations to Obtain the Code and CDSA Warrants. The Crown argued that only if both warrants are found to be invalid is s. 24 of the Charter. HELD: The Court rejected the application based upon the testimony of the only appearing witness that he had reasonable and probable grounds to obtain the search warrants. The Court found that the RCMP officer who prepared the two search warrants did not properly or intelligently state the offences in respect of which the warrant was issued. The items seized during the search ought to be excluded as evidence at his upcoming trial by virtue of s.24(2) of The Charter.  1) The evidence satisfied the Court that there was no bad faith, malice or intentional omission involved in the preparation of the warrant. The RCMP officer was negligent in failing to review the applicable sections and forms of the code and the CDSA. The CDSA Warrant does not meet the minimum lawful requirements for a search of a residence. The seizure of the property from inside the dwelling and vehicles and equipment seized from the surrounding premises are legal and valid. The absence of any malevolent intention, while it does not in these circumstances bear directly upon the validity of the warrants, is nevertheless commented upon because of the effect of exclusion/inclusion upon the repute of the administration of justice. 2) The Court accepted the Crown's submission that the search warrant as issued was invalid. It is the Court's position that the warrant is invalid that leaves only the facial validity of that warrant to consider.  3) In the circumstances, the Court was unable to determine the extent to which the impugned search warrant violated s. 8 of the Code. The evidence satisfies the Court on the balance of probabilities that the warrants cannot be sustained. There was no similar specific requirement in the authorizing sections, however, saying that the offence must be stated on the face of the Search Warrant itself. The Order of the Crown issued to the accused that authorized the search of his residence and that the items obtained as result of the search were excluded from the evidence at the accused’s trial pursuant to ss. 24(2). The Court reviewed the various types of search warrants issued in the course of investigation and concluded that","The accused applies by notice of motion to quash the search warrants that were issued authorizing the search of his residence and to exclude any evidence obtained as a result of the search. The application alleges a violation of the accused's s. 8 Charter rights. HELD: Although the search warrants relied upon in this case are invalid and the resultant search of the accused's premises was a violation of his s.8 Charter rights, nevertheless, the facts and all the circumstances do not satisfy the Court that the admission of the evidence would bring the administration of justice into disrepute. The application to exclude the evidence is dismissed.  1) The Crown stipulated the s. 487 Criminal Code warrant is invalid. That leaves the validity of s. 11 of Controlled Drugs and Substances Act (CDSA). 2) The CDSA warrant is invalid in that it does not sufficiently or adequately state the offences in respect of which the warrant was issued. The search was therefore warrantless. 3) The evidence seized was non-conscriptive and so its admission would not render the trial unfair. 4) There was no bad faith, malice or intentional omission involved in the preparation of the warrants. The officer was negligent in failing to review the applicable sections and forms of the Code and the CDSA. The absence of any malevolent intention, while it does not bear on the validity of the warrants, has some bearing in the s. 24(2) Charter analysis. 5) The existence of reasonable and probable grounds to obtain the search warrants to search the accused's residential premises, together with the seizure of $750,000 in cash from the accused's residence as a result of the search, fulfill a number of the circumstances under s. 24(2) of the Charter."
"FIAT: The respondent applies to vary his February 28, 1992 divorce judgment to fix support for his oldest son, who resides with him, retroactive to August 1, 2004 and to terminate the payment to his former spouse for August 2004. The issue of whether these orders should be made retroactive was reserved. HELD: 1) The Court has jurisdiction to vary support orders pursuant to the Divorce Act. The Court prefers the approach taken by the British Columbia Court of Appeal. They note that the British Columbian Court of appeal did not refer to the impact of the Guidelines on retroactive support but rather to the effect of the legislation. 2) The British Columbia court of appeal does not directly refer to this issue. The Alberta Court of appeals does. 3) The case law clearly states that the presumption in favour of retroactive child support lies within the Court's discretion and there is no provisions that indicate how that discretion is to be exercised.","The respondent applies to vary his 1992 divorce judgment to fix support for his oldest son, who resides with him, retroactive to August 2004 and to terminate the payment to his former spouse for him. In March 2005, this Court made an order fixing the parties incomes and providing for ongoing support for this son of $129 per month. The sole issue is whether these orders should be made retroactive. HELD: It is fair and equitable to terminate the respondent's obligation to pay $670 per month for the oldest son effective August 2004 and to make the petitioner's support payments for him retroactive to that date.  1) This Court favours an approach to retroactive child support that leaves the decision to the discretion of the Court. In exercising that discretion, the Court must keep in mind the objectives of the Guidelines and take into consideration the circumstances of each individual case. 2) The Court must consider whether the application is interim or final, the objectives of the Guidelines, the same factors should apply to retroactive orders whether they increase or decrease child support and whether they are pursuant to federal or provincial legislation, and the individual facts of each case must be considered to ensure that parents are jointly responsible for the support of their children and the principles of fairness and equity are met. If the Court decides to order retroactive support then, pursuant to s. 15(6.1) of the Divorce Act, it must do so in accordance with the Guidelines. 3) By February 2004, the respondent had written to the petitioner, putting her on notice that he wanted the payment to terminate because the oldest son was residing with him. The petitioner refused even though the son had very little contact with her. There was no justification for the payment to continue. It is difficult to understand her failure to provide support for this son while at the same time insisting on the continuation of the respondent's payment for that same son, who was spending no time with her."
"The appellant appeals the judgment of the Provincial Court made pursuant to s. 39 of The Small Claims Act, 1997, c. S-50.11, as am. (the Act Act). HELD: An appeal is not trial de novo but an appeal on the record and the findings of fact by the trial judge must be given a high degree of appellate deference. The findings of facts by the learned trial judge are reasonably supported by the evidence and there is no palpable and overriding error. The trial judge did not make an error of law based on the standard of correctness. The appeal is dismissed.","The appellant appeals the judgment of the Provincial Court pursuant to s. 39 of The Small Claims Act, 1997.

"The mother sought shared parenting with the father. The parties had been in a relationship for approximately thirty years and had two children, aged 15 and 18. The children were in the mother's care every second weekend. The mother alleged the husband was abusive to the wife and had sought an equal time shared parenting arrangement. The father sought to have the custody of the children placed in the wife's custody. The wife did not participate in the parenting process as she was not a credible witness. HELD: The court found that both parties were unable, at this stage in their relationship, to meet the basic requirements for successful shared parenting. While shared parenting is appropriate for the children, it does not necessarily mean joint custody is in the best interest of them. Both parties have demonstrated a depressing lack of cooperation. This has resulted in the vitiation of virtually all direct communication with the children. They do not meet face to face and do not talk on the phone. Their e-mails are curt at best. They use their children as a means of communicating with them. The nature and cause of conflict between the parties is one factor that must be considered.","The parties were separated and had difficulty communicating. They were together for eight years, and had two children (ages six and three). The husband had interim care and sought sole custody/primary care, while the wife wanted shared custody (50/50). She alleged the husband was abusive. The evidence showed she unreasonably refused to cooperate with him in relation to matters concerning the children. Sole custody/primary care to the father, with access to the mother as per the interim arrangement (every second weekend and other times). The mother was not credible and her allegations of abuse unfounded. If a party expects the court to believe there was domestic abuse, their position on parenting should reflect that. Shared custody arrangements require cooperation and the ability to jointly plan. Similarly, joint custody requires a level of cooperation. A requirement to make decisions jointly is not in the children's best interests if it leads to conflict and creates a potential power imbalance. Looking at the nature and extent of the parents' conflict, sole custody is appropriate until there has been an established track record of respectful parenting."
"The accused, charged with impaired driving, applied to the Court pursuant to s. 24(1) and s. 2 of the Charter for a variety of remedies, including a stay of the impaired driving charge, an order for a mistrial on that count, a direction that the Crown prosecutor be allowed to further cross-examine Crown witnesses and an order excluding evidence. The accused suffered actual prejudice in his right to make full answer and defence as a result of a lack of full disclosure.HELD: The police officer did not know the full content of the Operational Checksheets until after he had completed his cross-examination of the author of the document, Cst. Pshyk. Had he known of the reference to slurred speech in the original document, he would have known that such a question would have inevitably drawn the re-direct examination which occurred in this case. The officer would not have challenged the prosecutor on his failure to made mention that the accused's speech was slurred and the incomplete copy went to both the defence lawyer and the Crown Prosecutor. The prosecutor referred to the original Checksheet during Cst.'Pshyk's re-direction testimony and introduced the Checksheet into evidence without taking sufficient time and care to ensure that the original was what he had in his file and what had been disclosed to the defence. The Court was satisfied that the failure in disclosure by the RCMP resulted in an unfairness which could not be remedied through an adjournment and disclosure order or by exclusion of evidence.","The accused was charged with impaired care or control. The Court dismissed the charge of care or control over .08 after a non-suit application. During re-examination of the final Crown witness, and after the defence had concluded its cross-examination of the witness, it became apparent that the disclosure package given to both the Crown and Defence did not include the bottom portion of the Intoxilizer Operator's Checklist because it had been cut off during photocopying. During the defence cross-examination, the officer testified that he could not recall if the accused had slurred speech. In re-direct, the Crown showed the officer the original Intoxilizer Operator's Checklist and the officer confirmed that it listed slurred speech in the observations section.  The accused applied for relief under s. 24(1) of the Charter alleging a breach of his right to make full answer and defence. HELD: The defence lawyer did not know the full content of the Intoxilizer Operator's Checksheet until after he had completed his cross-examination of the author of the document. The Court was satisfied that if the defence lawyer had been aware of what was noted in the document, he would not have challenged the officer on his failure to mention that the accused's speech was slurred because he would have been able to predict that such a question would result in re-direct by the Crown. The accused suffered actual prejudice in his right to make full answer and defence and a breach of s. 7 is made out. While the Court cannot attribute bad faith to either the RCMP or the Crown, the Court was satisfied that the prosecutor referred to the original checksheet during its re-examination of the officer without taking sufficient time and care to ensure that the original was what had been disclosed to the Crown and Defence. This is an exceptional case where the lack of full disclosure and the time at which it was discovered rendered the trial unfair in a way that can only be remedied by excluding the evidence under s. 24(1)."
"The plaintiff operates the Whitewood Inn and in September 2007, entered into an agreement with the defendant to supply and install business equipment at the Inn. The defendant alleges that the equipment sold never worked properly and seeks damages for breach of contract and in the alternative, damages for negligent misrepresentation, damage for unjust enrichment, all in the amount of $20,000. HELD: The majority of the facts are not in serious dispute. There is no evidence of fraud or any concealment of facts that would allow the plaintiff's claim to succeed and there is further evidence of unjust enrichment. The plaintiff has always made his payments to the defendant and it has been in the exclusive possession of the plaintiff at all material times. The Plaintiff has not established any element of its case on a balance of probabilities.","The plaintiff entered into a verbal agreement for the defendant to supply and install business equipment. The plaintiff alleged that the equipment sold never worked properly and sought damages for breach of contract and, in the alternative, damages for fraudulent misrepresentation, damages for negligent misrepresentation, and damages for unjust enrichment in the amount of $20,000. HELD: The Court dismissed the action as the plaintiff did not establish its case on a balance of probabilities.  The Limitations Act applies and the action was barred. The defendant agreed to supply and install the equipment which was done; there was no agreement to maintain, service or reprogram equipment. There was no material misrepresentation or fraud or concealment of facts, nor unjust enrichment."
"The plaintiffs commenced an action against the defendants, Xtreme Mining & Demolition Inc. and Leonard Banga, for wrongful dismissal and for inducing breach of contract. The defendants brought three separate causes of action. The first claim, wrongful dismissal, was advanced by the plaintiffs against both the defendants and the plaintiff. The second cause was for defamation. HELD: 1) Rule 7-9 of the Queen's Bench Rules provides for strikes on pleadings submitted by the applicants in relation to various issues of claim. The pleadings contain indirect quotes attributed to the defendant and other defendants. 2) The statements of media outlets reproduced at para. 67(a), (c) and (d) of the statement of claim describe the alleged defamatory statements with sufficient certainty, clarity and precision that the defendants ought to be fully equipped to respond. 3) The plaintiff's claim for moral damages was struck as being material to the issue of wrongful dismissal. 4) The facts in para. 50 were immaterial to the plaintiffs' case as they were not relevant to the issues to be tried. 5) There was no attempt to connect extrinsic evidence reported on by news agencies and the issues between Banga and the defendant with the pleadings. Rather, they were mere platitudes.  6) The defendants were granted costs of the application in the amount of $35,000 to the plaintiff for the cause of defamation.","Civil Procedure – Pleadings – Statement of Claim – Striking OutCivil Procedure – Queen’s Bench Rule 7-9 The plaintiffs commenced an action against the defendants that included three causes of action: a claim against Xtreme Mining and Banga for wrongful dismissal; a claim for defamation brought against Banga; and for inducing breach of contract against Potash Corp. The defendants, Xtreme and Banga, brought an application pursuant to Queen’s Bench rules 7-9(1), (2), and 13-8 for an order that portions of the statement of claim be struck out as immaterial. The plaintiffs included in their pleadings regarding the first cause of action paragraphs that described the details of the plaintiff Bell’s business and real property, which he owned before he was hired by the applicants. Regarding the plaintiff’s pleadings respecting the second cause of action, they included details of the plaintiff Bell’s health condition at the time he was dismissed from employment. The plaintiffs pleaded a description of the contents of a meeting between them, Banga and his legal counsel in connection with the second cause, which, if proven, would establish that the plaintiffs were not responsible for acts of intimidation and that the defendants dismissed the plaintiffs for an improper and malicious purpose. The facts were material to the issue of wrongful dismissal and defamation. The other paragraphs that were considered immaterial by the applicants dealt with remarks made by Banga to the media. HELD: The court dismissed the application with respect to the plaintiffs’ pleadings about the plaintiff’s prior business and health condition. Similarly, the plaintiffs’ pleadings with regards to the meeting were not struck, nor were the paragraphs related to the reporting in the media as the plaintiffs were not certain of the exact words used by the defendant, and therefore could not draft anything at that time. It allowed the application respecting the pleadings that related to an individual who was not a party and struck the paragraphs in question as irrelevant and immaterial."
"The accused was convicted, by a jury, of sexually assaulting his common-law spouse. The offence was contrary to s. 271(1) of the Criminal Code. The accused had separated from the common law wife a few days prior and had been seen by her children. She had called the accused late in the night prior to the offence and said that she did not care if she went to jail for this. HELD: A fit and proper sentence for the crime, taking into account the circumstances of this offence and the requirements of denunciation and general deterrence, was a sentence of two years and eight months, the total being thirty-two months. Under s.100(1), the accused was prohibited from possessing or possessing firearms for a period of ten years.","The defendant was convicted by a jury of sexually assaulting his common law spouse. They had separated; she continued to reside in the home with the children. Because of his repeated phone calls, she became afraid to stay in the house. She took the children to her father's house. The defendant entered the house in the night and assaulted the complainant when she returned to pick up some clothes. Imposing a sentence of two years eight months, plus a ten year firearm prohibition, that this offence could be categorized as a major sexual assault. The principles of sentencing and the impact on the victim, especially in view of the fact that she was his common-law spouse, made this sentence fit."
"The plaintiff nurse took part in a separate action against the defendants after she was injured in a motor vehicle accident. The nurse advised against driving after having an abortion. The plaintiff also testified that she was concerned about the plaintiff's ability to drive home after the abortion. Awarding $115,000 in damages, that the plaintiff should not have been allowed to drive. The court referred to the example of the nurse at the V.G. Hospital who operated the 'MacPhail Vehicle' in an Easterly direction on a highway between the hours of 1:00 to 2:00 p.m. 2)It was a judgment call on the part of the nursing staff to determine if the patient was well enough to leave on her own. 3)The plaintiff was permitted to drive for a minimum of 24 hours following sedating medication. The driver was not permitted to have the procedure performed on her behalf for any medical reason. The medical reasonableness of the claim was based on the fact that most of the patients with whom the plaintiff had dealt in the past had had the procedure for some time prior to the procedure.","The plaintiff had an abortion at a Halifax clinic. The plaintiff was in the recovery room for 30 to 45 minutes after the procedure, and then left. On the drive home, she was injured in a motor vehicle accident when she fainted and her car crossed the centre line of the highway and struck another vehicle. She sued three members of the clinic staff, including the doctor who performed the abortion, alleging negligence in letting her drive after the abortion. Awarding the plaintiff $724,000 for past and future loss of income, future loss of pension, and general damages, that based on the evidence of the possible complications from surgery such as an abortion, and considering the emotional impact of an abortion on all women, the defendants breached their standard of care as health care professionals in permitting the plaintiff to drive after the abortion."
"The landlord applied for an order for a writ of possession pursuant to s50 of the Landlord and Tenant Act. The applicants had entered a lease with the landlords in 1995 with the intention of carrying out their business. A fire in 1995 had destroyed the whole lease. The occupants of the lease had insured against loss of business for 30 years. After a fire the occupants abased the premises for 5 years. The landlords had insured for 30 year's rent. HELD: The application was dismissed. 1)A trial of the issue was directed to determine whether the respondents were in breach of the covenants in the lease as alleged by the applicants regarding the unpaid rent and the failure to maintain proper weed control. 2)The payment due May 1, 1998 was not made because the tenant had breached the lease(clause 5.2) and because there was a pre-condition to the lease wherein the husband promised to repair the damage.  3)The hail damage may allow the tenants to claim in damages against the landlord but it cannot be construed as a debt due for purposes of s27 of the landlord and tenant act. 4)The conditions of the leases were not met. The tenant was required to give notice of the claim of set off and the rent outstanding for more than 2 calendar months. 5)The issues with respect to the hail damage could allow the MacFarlanes to claim a debt against the tenant but not be construed by s27. The hail damage was far in excess of the amount provided for s27 debt due to the landlord by the landlord.  6)The tenant was entitled to a Writ of possession directed to the sheriff to put the applicant in possession of s30, Township 16, Range 6, West of the Second Meridian.","Landlord and Tenant - Writ of Possession_____ The landlord applied for an order for a writ of possession pursuant to s50 of the Landlord and Tenant Act. The 41 month lease required a monthly rental of $500 for the first five months and thereafter semi-annual payments of $5,000. The tenants had not paid any rent in 1998 nor had they maintained insurance; they installed alternating stalls in the barn in breach of their covenant not to make any alterations or additions to the premises; breached the express and implied covenants to keep the premises in good condition and tenantable repair by their failure to remove and properly dispose of baler twine, to maintain proper weed control or to remove manure buildup in the calf barn. The tenants admitted the rental payment was due in May but claimed the landlord breached the pre-condition wherein Russell's husband promised to repair the damage caused by a 1995 hail storm. The claims for repair was far in excess of those provided for in the lease which were the tenant's responsibility._____ HELD: 1)The landlord was entitled to a writ of possession since the tenants were in breach of the covenant to pay rent for more than two calendar months. 2)A trial of the issue was ordered to determine whether the tenants were in breach of covenants in the lease.

"An application under Part VIII of the Automobile Accident Insurance Act for income replacement benefits contending that the accident caused the disc herniation. The respondent, Saskatchewan Government Insurance, denied the claim. The applicant applied for review of its decision and appealed to the Court pursuant to s. 197. HELD: The application was dismissed. 1)Accident is defined in s.100(1)(a) as any event in which bodily injury is caused by an automobile. The onus is on the applicant to establish his claim to the benefits on a balance of probabilities.  2)The applicant was not diagnosed as suffering from a herniated disc or from any injury or dysfunction of the discs. He was generally in good health and had no evidence of any back problems. 3)A review of all of the evidence led the Court to conclude that the applicant had not met the onus on him of establishing causation on a balanced of probabilities and that for a period of time after the hernaiation, the non-earner was unable to hold the employment he could have held at the time of the accident and would be entitled to an income replacement benefit if the heriation was caused by the accident.",The applicant sustained a lower back injury in an automobile accident in February 1995 which resolved within ten days to two weeks. In June 1995 he began to experience pain in his back which slowly worsened until he was hospitalized in October 1995. He was diagnosed with a large central and right sided disc herniation. SGI denied his claim for income replacement benefits as a non-earner under s.117(1) of the Automobile Accident Insurance Act. In issue was whether the accident caused the disc herniation. HELD: The appeal was dismissed. The plaintiff had not met the onus on him of establishing causation on a balance of probabilities. Two family physicians supported his contention but the medical director of rehabilitation services for SGI and the orthopaedic surgeon who treated the applicant were both of the opinion the herniation was not caused by the accident.
"The plaintiff sought an order requiring the defendant to pay the balance of its 35% share of the costs associated with the Horizontal Well plus $49,701.61 representing 35% of the regular lifting and production costs of all joint interest wells under the Operating Agreement. The plaintiff also sought a declaration that it holds a builders' lien against the defendant's interest in the Well and other joint interest assets to the extent of the debts due. HELD: 1) The defendant denied liability for any share in the costs referred to in the Supplemental AFE. 2) The plaintiff was given notice that it owed $69,025.20 representing 35 percent of the screw pump costs incurred after the default notice. 3) The respondent was not responsible for any of the drilling and completion costs. Costs in excess of $1 million were incurred. 4) The plaintiffs claim that the defendant was liable for 35%of all drilling, completion costs and costs under both the Original and Supplemental AFEs. 5) The Court relied primarily on Clause 301 of Article III of CAPL 1981. Clause 301 provides that the Operator is delegated the control and management of the exploration, completion and maintenance of the wells and is responsible for all costs and expenses incurred. The Court found that the respondent conducted certain operations without authority, was negligent in conducting operations and overcharged or made improper charges in its accounting procedures. The court found that at the material time, the respondent was prepared to accept surrender and quit claim in full satisfaction of the amount owing but gave notice that in default of payment in full or the granting of quit claim, it would proceed with steps to recover the indebtedness. 6) The defendants were granted leave to reply to the plaintiff's demand.","Coachlight sought an order requiring the defendant to pay the balance of its 35% share of $681,955.58 as costs for drilling a petroleum/natural gas well plus $49,701.61 representing its 35% share of the lifting and production costs under the Operating Agreement. The plaintiff also sought a declaration that it holds builders' liens against the defendant's interest in the Well and other joint interest assets to the extent of the debts due. Duce Oil denies liability for any costs of the horizontal well in excess of $447,535 being 110% of the authorization for expenditure executed with respect to the Well. The defendant counterclaimed on the basis the plaintiff conducted certain operations without authority, was negligent in conducting operations and overcharged or made improper charges in its accounting procedures. HELD: 1)Duce was liable for $96,286.95 representing 35% of the unpaid costs of the original and supplemental authorization for expenditures (AFE) and the costs of the screw pump. 2)Duce was responsible for $49,701.61 representing regular lifting and production costs and other joint interest wells plus expenditures under $25,000 which did not require an AFE. 3)Coachlight was only entitled to interest from the time of its written notice on June 20/94 that it was exercising its option under the CAPL 1981 to charge interest. 4)In default of payment within 90 days of Judgment the plaintiff would be entitled to a builders' lien in the entire estate or interest of the defendant in all petroleum, natural gas and other hydrocarbons except coal and valuable stone, upon or under the lands as specified together with all proceeds from the defendant's interests in petroleum and natural gas and its interest in fixtures, machinery, tools, appliances and other property in any of the defendant's oil or gas wells on those lands. 5)The totality of the evidence did not support the portrayal by the defendant of the plaintiff as a high handed, arrogant operator who simply forgot it had a minority partner.  6)The plaintiff was entitled to its taxable costs."

The plaintiff claimed the creditor wrongfully converted monies after a full and final settlement of his account for a lesser sum ($2,000 on a $15,600 account). He sought punitive damages for 'high-handed and malicious behaviour'. The plaintiff assigned his future crop insurance benefits and Canadian Wheat Board payments for application to his outstanding account in May 2001. In June 2001 a farmhand had an accident, while operating his employer's unlicensed vehicle. An occupant of the other vehicle in the accident was critically injured and died. The defendant says it was subsequently induced to settle the debt for a lesser sum by the plaintiff's false representation that SGI was suing him for between $200,000 and $300,000; that he would be found liable and would likely make an assignment in bankruptcy, making the account uncollectible. SGI initiated proceedings against the plaintiff in May 2002 claiming $17,660.

"The plaintiff purchased a new Meyer Manure Spreader, Model 5570 from the defendant, Apollo Distributing Corporation (Apollo). The plaintiff claims the Spreader was 'entirely unfit for spreading compost' and did not meet the warranties imposed by operation of the Act. HELD: The action is dismissed. Costs are awarded to the defendant. The plaintiff has not established to a balance of probabilities that the spreader was not fit for the purpose of spreading compost nor manufactured in compliance with the warranties contained in the Act. Other than the fact of a chain breakage on two separate occasions, there was no evidence produced by the plaintiff, either in his affidavit or during his testimony, addressing the cause of breakage.  1) The plaintiff was not required to make further written representations as to the nature of the representations made, the reason for the refusal, and the manner in which the representations were provided. 2) The dealer and distributor are expressly entitled to an opportunity to repair or correct the deficiencies upon receipt of notice in writing. The defendants were deprived of the opportunity to inspect and repair by the unreasonable actions of the plaintiff in his failure to allow the return of the Spreaders. 3) There was no written notice given to the purchaser prior to the purchase date.

"The accused, a young person within the meaning of the Youth Criminal Justice Act, was charged with having in his possession, crack cocaine, contrary to s. 5(2) of the Controlled Drugs and Substances Act. A voir dire held to determine the lawfulness of the strip search of the accused by police, and the admissibility of 17.8 grams of crack cocaine found on the accused. The police had intercepted the stolen vehicle at the Halifax Youth Justice Court and, based on the officer's testimony, determined that the search was conducted for the purpose of finding evidence. The strip search was lawful and there was no breach of R. C.'s s. 8 rights to be free from unreasonable search and seizure. In the event of a Charter breach, the evidence would be ruled admissible. The burden is on the applicant, the defence, to establish on a balance of probabilities, that the admission of the drugs located on the person of C. would render the trial unfair. There is nothing in the YCJA or the common law which requires that young persons be afforded an opportunity to consult counsel and/or parent or guardian prior to a police strip search. Their exclusion would end the prosecution and that would call into question the reputation of the administration of justice.","A youth was arrested and charged with possession of a stolen motor vehicle after the vehicle arrived near the location of a pre-arranged drug transaction. The youth was later charged with possession for the purposes of trafficking after a strip search conducted at the police station resulted in a quantity of crack cocaine being removed from his underwear. A voir dire was held to determine the lawfulness of the strip search and the admissibility of the cocaine seized. The evidence is admissible; there was no breach of s. 8 of the Charter and, in the event that there had been a breach of s.8, the admission of the evidence would not bring the administration of justice into disrepute. The strip search was incident to arrest and conducted in a reasonable manner, being reasonably quick and non-invasive. There is nothing in the Youth Criminal Justice Act or the common law which requires that young persons be afforded the opportunity to consult with counsel or a parent or guardian prior to a search. This was real evidence, the admission of which would not affect trial fairness; any breach was conducted in good faith; the search was motivated by a sense of urgency; and significant efforts were made to respect the privacy and personal integrity of the young person."
"The accused applied to set aside his guilty plea to count #1, the sexual assault of his son. The Court found that the accused had not seen the video of the alleged assault when he plead guilty, nor that a language/communication issue prevented him from having a full understanding of the specific allegation of sexual assault. The accused’s evidence regarding his lack of knowledge of the nature of the allegation and its effect on his ability to have contact with his son was not credible. The test in Nevin, supra, was not met and the accused was asked to withdraw his plea.","The defendant entered into a plea agreement to a charge of sexually assaulting his young son but, shortly before the sentencing hearing, he applied to withdraw his guilty plea on the basis that he had not been fully informed of the nature of the allegations, partly due to a communication issue (English was not his first language) and partly because he had not viewed the video of his son's statement to the police prior to the plea. He did not accept the Crown's version of the incident and had not fully understood the effect and consequences of his plea, especially its effect on his ability to have contact with his son. The defendant argued that he thought the charge was based upon an incident where he had touched his son's penis for the purpose of showing him how to clean it as opposed to the Crown's assertion that he had masturbated his son and himself while viewing pornography. Application to withdraw guilty plea dismissed; the defendant's evidence regarding his knowledge of the facts alleged by the Crown in relation to the sexual assault was inconsistent and the court was not convinced that either his failure to see the video of his son's statement or a language/communication issue had prevented him from having a full understanding of the specific allegation of the sexual assault. The defendant's motivation for pleading guilty did not alter his knowledge and understanding of the nature of the allegation nor his understanding that he was, by his plea, admitting to that allegation."
The Court granted the application. It then sought the police reports and witness statements of the accused in respect of two alleged victims of aggravated assaults and in respect for particular offences for which the accused had previously been convicted. The Crown also sought updated criminal records for each of the two accused. The Court found that the third party records in the possession of the applicant outweighed any residual privacy interest held by third parties in the material. The court also directed the Crown to provide updated criminal files to counsel for the accused.Copies of the documents were made available to counsel and to the Crown in sealed envelopes. The documents were to be returned to the Court in the coming weeks. The order for disclosure was granted.,"The accused was charged with second degree murder and two counts of aggravated assault. The accused made an O'Connor application for third party records relating to the two surviving Crown witnesses. In particular, the accused sought disclosure of police reports, videotaped evidence, witness statements, warned statements regarding the multiple arrests and charges incurred by the victims and disclosure of their criminal records. In 2012 SKQB 543, the Court ordered production of the records. This decision deals with whether the documents should be produced to the accused. HELD: The documents were disclosed to the accused. The judge vetted the documents to black out words, phrases or numbers that have no probative value or where the privacy interest of the witness would have been unjustifiably affected."
"The accused was charged with impaired driving contrary to s. 253(1)(a) the Criminal Code and with operating a motor vehicle while impaired by alcohol contrary to ss. 253 (1)(b) of the Code. The accused had consumed alcohol in such a quantity that the concentration in his blood exceeded 80 milligrams of alcohol in 100 millilitres of blood and he was transported to his home in Carlyle. The Crown appealed. HELD: Appeal dismissed. 1) The trial judge addressed the factors and correctly applied the test. As there was no error, the trial judge was not prepared to set aside his decision. 2) On a review of the facts and circumstances and the law, appellate courts should accord considerable deference to the final determination. The standard of review was set forth in R. v. Helm (2011 SKQB 32), 368 Sask. R. 115 at paras. 19 and 20. 3) The accused was clearly informed of his right to consult counsel. He was also provided with a copy of the driver's licence, the vehicle registration and sobriety report. When the computer search was negative, the matter was abandoned. The officer did not turn to the accused in an attempt to reduce the number of names. There really was no similarity between the name 'Vaughn' and that of a relative who was known to him. It was most unlikely that some physical impediment caused the accused to make mistake. His speech was not slurred. 4) The respondent was not provided with the number for a telephone number to call free of charge.","The accused was charged with one count of impaired driving and one count of operating a motor vehicle while his blood alcohol content exceeded .08, contrary to ss. 253(1)(a) and 253(1)(b) of the Criminal Code. After trial, the accused was found not guilty on both charges. The Crown appealed on the basis that the trial judge erred in law in finding that the accused's rights were violated pursuant to s. 10(b) of the Charter and by excluding the evidence pursuant to s. 24(2) of the Charter. The accused was stopped by RCMP at 2:47 am to check his licence, registration, and sobriety. There were no driving irregularities leading to the stop. The officer noted a slight smell of alcohol and the accused blew a 'fail' on the roadside screening device. The accused indicated at roadside that he would like to contact a lawyer. At the detachment, the accused was asked which lawyer he wanted to contact and the accused gave a name to which the officer misunderstood. A search for the misunderstood name by the officer did not result in any findings. A search for a second name given by the accused resulted in 60 persons and the officer did not pursue any of them. The officer suggested legal aid but the accused refused. The accused was never provided a phone or a phonebook. The accused subsequently indicated that he understood the waiver regarding legal counsel and that he did not want to contact one. The accused did not recall this waiver. The accused indicated that he provided breath samples right away because he thought the officer was in a hurry and he understood that if he did not provide breath samples he was automatically guilty. The accused's readings were .11 and .04. The trial judge held that the accused was not given a reasonable opportunity to exercise his right to counsel of his choice and that the appropriate remedy was to exclude the breath sample results. HELD: The appeal was not successful. Whether there has been a Charter breach and whether evidence should thus be excluded are both questions of law reviewable on a standard of correctness. There is both an informational component and an implementational component to s. 10(b). The implementational component was the one of concern because the accused was not provided with the opportunity to consult counsel of his choice. The appeal court had to determine who was responsible for that failure. The failure was that of the officer first in misunderstanding the lawyer's name, then in not asking the accused the name again, and then in abandoning the search of the second lawyer when too many names were returned. The waiver did not remedy the situation because the accused did not fully understand it and it was therefore not effective. The trial judge did not err in finding that the accused`s s. 10(b) rights were breached. The trial judge correctly applied the test for s. 24(2) and the finding that the admission of the breath samples would bring the administration of justice into disrepute was not set aside."
"The accused was charged with sexual activity with respect to her 8-year-old son. The accused was found in possession of two computers and a laptop computer. The search was conducted on the basis of a search warrant. The court found that the information to obtain the search warrant was sufficiently defective that the warrant was invalid, thereby infringing s. 10(b) of the Charter and that evidence obtained should be excluded. The evidence obtained was not relevant to the defence's argument that the search was done without authority concerned insufficiency of the ITO on which the decision to issue the search had been made, and alleged unreasonableness of the issuing justice’s decision. The ITO did not permit further searches of the computer or the files of persons with whom the accused had been involved. The affidavit did not differentiate between information personally obtained by the accused and information from third party sources and state that he considers those sources to be credible and worthy of belief. The plain view doctrine only permits seizures of items in plain view, and does not permit any further searches not authorized in the warrant by a justice acting judicially. The cumulative effect of these errors was that the Court could not, in the form presented, support the issue of the search by a Justice acting judiciously. The Court found that, given the extensive search of the premises and the fact that the accused was separated from her estranged husband and engaged in a matrimonial dispute with her son, it was reasonable to conclude that the pictures were of sexual nature. Therefore, the Court excluded the evidence obtained as a result of the voir dire.","Constitutional Law – Charter of Rights, Section 8Criminal Law – Sexual Touching – Child VictimThe accused was charged that she did, with a sexual purpose, invite a person under the age of 16 years to touch a part of her body contrary to s. 152 of the Criminal Code. The case involved alleged improper acts by the accused with respect to her eight-year-old son. The information regarding the alleged incident had been given by the accused’s son to her husband. The parties were separated. The husband apparently involved a child protection worker, who interviewed the child. After this RCMP were contacted. On the basis of an RCMP’s affidavit, an ITO was prepared and a search warrant obtained. During the search, the accused’s cell phone was seized and photographs were found on it. They showed the accused lying naked on a bed with her breasts and vaginal area covered and showing her son in his pajamas, holding a bottle of lotion and touching her legs, feet and stomach. Before trial, defence counsel requested that a voir dire be held for the purpose of determining whether the information to obtain the search warrant (ITO) was sufficiently defective that the warrant was invalid, thereby infringing s. 8 of the Charter and that the evidence obtained should be excluded. The ITO did not allege that the commission of sexual assault or the creation of child pornography. The search warrant though authorized a search for images of explicit sexual activity with a person under the age of 18, with emphasis on sexual organs and the anal region, which were not related to the offence alleged to have been committed and was not supported by the ITO. The warrant authorized the search and search of devices that included cameras capable of storing images or data and computers or any other electronic devices as well as conventional photographs depicting sexual activity as described above. However, the warrant to search specifically stated that the police were authorized to search for the said “things and to bring them before or some other justice”. When the search warrant was executed, about three constables and a social worker went to the accused’s home. She was in her bedroom and was very upset when advised that there would be a search of her house. She was arrested for obstruction when she objected to the police looking at a computer, taken into custody and removed from the house to a police vehicle. During the ensuing search, one officer looked through a computer, searching for pictures. He testified that he had done so as “previewing for relevancy” and had in fact, found relevant photographs. Another constable, who had not reviewed the warrant, searched the accused’s purse and found a cell phone, which was an item not included in the warrant. Other issues raised by the defence included that the information contained in the affidavit had not met the test of establishing that an offence had been committed and that misleading information had been included. The affidavit had identified that the search was for explicit sexual pictures that did not correspond to the information obtained from the child, who was the only source of information of the alleged offence. The information in the ITO came from a number of different sources, including the original complaint by the accused’s husband who was engaged in a matrimonial dispute with her. The husband had made a number of complaints against his wife in the past, none of which resulted in a conviction. The officer who swore the affidavit had not differentiated between information obtained by him and information from third party sources. The officer also set out information, including photographs, he had obtained from an Internet search that pertained to the accused as a lingerie model. The purpose of including the information was not made clear. The officer did not disclose in the ITO the detailed nature of the information disclosed by the child to the child protection worker, which would have had the potential to detract from the likelihood of an offence having been committed, such as the accused asking her son to massage her because she was sore. The child stated that he did not believe that he had been sexually abused. Furthermore, the child identified the photographer, but the police had not interviewed him. The issues before the Court were: 1) if the Warrant to Search was valid in view of the issues raised with respect to the completeness and validity of the ITO; 2) if the search of the computer conducted on the premises was legal, either because of the rules established in R. v. Vu or because of the wording of the warrant itself; and 3) if there was a breach or breaches of the Charter, should the evidence be excluded?  HELD: The Court found with respect to the issues that: 1) the ITO could not support the issue of the warrant by a justice acting judicially in considering the effect of the statements in the ITO regarding modelling and the omission of the information in the child protection worker’s report, that the husband of the accused had previously made allegations against her, the misleading statement in the ITO concerning the specific types of pictures that the officers would search for, suggesting an investigation of more serious activity not supported by the information provided. The Warrant to Search was a nullity and the search unlawful; 2) the search of the computer on the premises was illegal both in terms of its violation of the terms of the warrant and because the Supreme Court decided in Vu that a warrant must expressly grant the authority to search a computer; and 3) the evidence from the illegal search of the computer was excluded. The breach of the accused’s s. 8 Charter right was serious because of the negligence shown by the police in their investigation of the complaint, the drafting of the ITO and the execution of the warrant. The impact of the breach on the accused was serious. Her entire home was unlawfully searched as well. The effect of the search was emotional and upsetting to the accused and resulted in her arrest. The interests of society in the administration of justice will be protected because the exclusion of the evidence would not be determinative of the Crown’s case."
The vendors and their predecessors in title had established a good and marketable possessory title to a residential lot adjoining a church property. The plaintiffs brought an application under the Vendors and Purchasers Act for a declaration that an objection to title raised by the purchasers/defendants was without merit. Application granted in part; the evidence submitted by the vendors was so remote as to be frivolous and as such was not a valid object to title.,"This was an application by the plaintiff vendors for a declaration that an objection to title raised by the defendant purchasers was without merit. For the plaintiffs, that the Vendors and Purchasers Act can be used to establish possessory title, and the plaintiffs had succeeded in demonstrating 'open, notorious and continuous possession' of the property for over 40 years. The possibility of a claim by the Crown under the Escheats Act was ruled so remote as to be frivolous."
"This was a charge of failing to yield contrary to s. 50(3) of the Highway Traffic Act. The defendant stopped at an intersection for 15 seconds to allow several south-bound vehicles to go by, and then began his left turn. The plaintiff's passenger was knocked unconscious and received a cut to the head requiring three or four stitches. HELD: The defendant was found not guilty.  1) The defendant's actions did not fall short of the standard of care demanded of ordinary drivers faced with similar circumstances and that with respect to the failure to yield the defence of due diligence has been established. The court found as a fact that when the defendant commenced his turn, any vehicle lawfully approaching from the opposite direction would have been able to avoid the collision. 2) On a balance of probabilities the defendant was entitled to assume that it was safe to do so, as there did not appear to be any other vehicles close enough to the intersection to present a hazard.","A charge of failing to yield, contrary to s.50(3) of the Highway Traffic Act. The collision caused extensive damage to the defendant's vehicle and totaled the second. Two passengers were knocked unconscious. One sustained a bruised collar bone and the other required stitches to the head. HELD: The defendant was found not guilty. His action did not fall short of the standard of care demanded of ordinary prudent drivers faced with similar circumstances. The defence of due diligence was established with respect to the failing to yield. The second requirement of s.50(3) is that the defendant shall not make a turn until he has afforded a reasonable opportunity to the approaching vehicle to avoid a collision. It was found as a fact that that when he commenced his turn, any lawfully vehicle approaching from the opposite direction would have been able to avoid the collision.  1)Since the defendant turned across the path of the on-coming vehicle and since they came into collision, it would appear prima facie that he failed to yield as required by s.50(3). The right of way, however, is not absolute. As most regulatory offences s. 50(3) is an offence of strict liability which means that once it is established the defendant did the prohibited act, it is open to him to establish a defence of due diligence on a balance of probabilities. 2)Speeding by the second vehicle was a contributing factor. It could not be determined whether the second vehicle had only its parking lights on. Neither road nor weather conditions appeared to have been a factor. Alcohol was not a factor. Visibility was reasonably good given the time of day and the fact the intersection was lit by street lights. 3)When the defendant commenced his turn across the path of the second vehicle he was entitled to assume it was safe to do so as there did not appear to be any other vehicle close enough to the intersection to present a hazard."
"FIAT: This application by two siblings to act as personal decision-maker and property guardian for their 68-year old mother was opposed by the Public Trustee insofar as they request they be appointed property guardians without the necessity of a bond. HELD: 1) This is a routine application by siblings, who are most usually the applicants, and to consider this an appropriate case to dispense with a bond would be to largely negate the mandatory requirement for filing a bond contained in s. 55(1). Almost every application would so qualify because in most cases the nearest relatives and public trustee consent in writing. 2) The Court was not able to conclude this was an appropriate situation to dispensed with a Bond. The application to be appointed personal decision making-makers is in order and an order may issue with the authorities identified in the draft order submitted. With respect to the application for property guardianship no order was made. Leave is granted to the applicants to supplement the existing material should they see fit to do so.  3) One answer was to request the public trustee to become the property guardian pursuant to s. 30(b). The fees charged by thepublic trustee are set out in Regulation to The Public Guardian and Trustee Act and are not to be requested by the court. 4) The court should impose more strict conditions where the applicant is seeking to be appoint without the need of bond.","FIAT. An application by two siblings to act as personal decision makers and property guardians for their 68 year old mother, who suffers from Alzheimer's. Although their four siblings consented, the Public Trustee opposed their appointment as property guardians without a bond. This is one of a number of cases similarly contested by the Public Trustee since the Adult Guardianship and Co-Decision-Making Act was proclaimed July 15, 2001. Under the previous Dependent Adults Act, the Public Trustee was not served with notices of and did not intervene in applications for property guardianship and the practice for when a bond was required was ad hoc. The prescribed amount by regulation is $10,000. Arguments advanced by applicants generally is that a bond is expensive; in many cases the proposed applicants do not have adequate assets, which equal or exceed the value of the estate; the court has the power under the Adult Guardianship and Co-Decision-Making Act s.47(1)(a) to place any limitations or conditions on the guardianship it considers appropriate. HELD: The application to be appointed personal decision makers was granted. No order was made with respect to the application for property guardianship. The requirement for a bond is mandatory under the new Act as indicated by the use of the word 'shall' unless an applicant can qualify for dispensation under s.55(4). Under s.55(4)(b), it is no longer adequate for the nearest relatives to consent to the appointment. The only discretion is in s.55(4)(c) where the court may dispense with a bond in any other situation the court considers appropriate. Reading the section as a whole and bearing in mind both its purpose, context and historical evolution, the word 'appropriate' means suitable or appropriate for the end in view, which is to ensure the adult's estate remains intact during the guardianship, or can be restored in the event it does not. To consider this an appropriate case to dispense with a bond would be to largely negate the mandatory requirement for the filing of a bond contained in s.55(1)."
"The appellant sues the Halifax Regional Municipality for negligence. Years later, he decided he should amend his action to add a new claim against a new defendant. By then, the new claim was barred by a limitation period. He applied in Supreme Court chambers for permission to make the amendment. The chambers judge held that he did not have authority under Rules 15.01 and 15.02 to grant leave to the appellant to amend his statement of claim to add Lombard as a party and to assert the Section cause of action against it. The appellant applied to renew the application. The issue was whether the judge should have granted the amendment because this case did not fall into any of the specific powers to amend in the Civil Procedure Rules. HELD: The appeal was allowed and the application to set aside was allowed. The decision on whether the amendment should be granted was not appealed. The matter was left to the Supreme Court to decide. 1)Limidity of the Rules in relation to limitation periods has limited the Court's discretion to grant the amendment; the Court must consider all relevant matters. 2)The limitation period has intervened and an important consideration relates to whether the appellant's delay has prejudiced the defendant's defence. Lombard should receive notice. 3)The appeal was granted in part. The Court could not find a reason to deny the application but could not say that the chambers judge had not exercised his discretion. 4)Limitations may be used to permit an amendment to be granted in the absence of notice to a party. 5)The Court could only grant leave if it was apparent that the proposed new defendant had a reasonable basis to oppose being joined. 6)The issue was not whether the expiry of the limitation period trumps the power to amend, but whether it is just to grant it.","Six years after the action was commenced, the plaintiff applied to add the defendant's Section D insurer in order to add a cause of action against an unidentified driver. The limitation period for suing under Section D had expired and no notice of the application had been given to the insurer. The chambers judge held that he had no discretion to grant the amendment and dismissed the application. The plaintiff appealed. Appeal allowed; the plaintiff is entitled to renew the application for the amendment in Supreme Court chambers on notice to the proposed, as well as the existing, defendant within sixty days of today's date; if not filed within that time, the application to add the insurer will be deemed to have been abandoned. The court had a discretion to grant the amendment even though the case did not fall within any of the specific situations set out in Rule 15.02 as the broad power to amend conferred by Rule 15 is not limited to the specific instances set out the Rule. Although there was no firm rule that notice to a proposed defendant was necessary in all such applications, generally the applicant should give notice to the proposed defendant (as well as the existing parties) where it is apparent from the circumstances that the proposed defendant likely has a reasonable basis to oppose being joined, such as being prejudiced in its defence by the plaintiff's long delay in asserting his claim."
"The proposed appellants and proposed respondent were involved in litigation involving the ownership of some valuable breeding dogs which were in their possession of the proposed respondent but claimed by them claimed by the Proposed appellants. The proposed respondent sought and obtained a writ of replevin in relation to the dogs pursuant to Rules 406-10 of The Queen's Bench Rules and an order setting aside the writ, and ordering the dogs to be returned to her on the grounds that the affidavit filed in support of the writ contained false and misleading information. The chambers judge granted the application, finding on the basis of affidavit evidence filed before him that the respondent did not provide security as she was entitled to do by Rule 409A and the sheriff therefore seized two of the disputed dogs then in her possession. She then applied to the Court of Queen’s Bench for an order set aside and ordering them returned to the respondent. The appellants sought leave to appeal. HELD: Leave to appeal is granted. While the wording of the Rules of Court is not clearly vexatious in this case, the issue raised is whether chambers judged erred in seeking to question the accuracy of the facts sworn to in the affidavit, in light of the provision in Rule 407(2) that provides that the validity of a writ shall not be questioned in any interlocutory proceeding where the affidavit substantially complies with the requirements of subrule (1). The Court found that to allow the writ to stand would be an abuse of the process of the Court.","The proposed appellants and the proposed respondent were involved in litigation involving the ownership of some valuable breeding dogs that were in the possession of the proposed respondent, but claimed by the proposed appellants.

"A bankruptcy petition was filed in 1995 and received an absolute discharge in 1996. The trustee of the estate never applied for discharge. HELD: The order of the court was granted. The caveat should be vacated if it were not for the trustee's position that future accumulation of such equity should accrue to the benefit of the creditors. The administration did not oppose the applicant's discharge and in its report, prepared pursuant to s.170 of the Bankruptcy Act, the trustee stated there were no facts, matters or circumstances that would justify the court refusing an unconditional order of discharge. nonexempt equity did not exist at the time the applicant applied for it and the caveat was vacated. The court found that the applicant had not realized her non-exempt equity in the homestead until 13 years later, when the application for discharge was granted and the respondent applied for costs.","A bankruptcy petition against the applicant was filed on May 18, 1995 and a receiving order with respect to her property issued the following month. KPMG Inc. (formerly Peat Marwick Thorne Inc.) is the trustee of her bankrupt estate. The applicant received an absolute discharge on March 8, 1996. The trustee has never applied for a discharge. The trustee did not oppose the applicant's discharge and in its report dated February 8, 1996 stated that the there were no facts, matters or circumstances that would justify the Court in refusing an unconditional order of discharge. Now, more than 13 years later, there remains an unresolved issue concerning non-exempt equity in the applicant's homestead. The applicant applies for relief under s. 37 of the Bankruptcy and Insolvency Act for an order reversing the trustee's decisions and restoring the property interest to her. The Court reviewed the relevant case law and found that only the value of non-exempt homestead equity existing at the time of the bankrupt's application for discharge can be attached by the trustee. HELD: The Court made the order applied for by the applicant including an order for costs."
"The landlord appealed a decision rendered by a hearing officer under The Residential Tenancies Act. The issue concerned the tenants' claim for damages and return of the security deposit arising out of the landlord's notice to vacate. HELD: The Court held that the hearing officer erred by failing to give the landlord an opportunity to respond to the claims and evidence of the tenants. The Court found no reviewable error by the Hearing Officer. With regard to the award of damages, the Court concluded that the decision on rent abatement was made on a principled and logical basis having regard to all the facts. The purpose of the award was to compensate the tenants for their loss of use of usable space. The award for moving costs was intended in part to compensate for inconvenience and aggravation, and in part as compensatory loss for related expenses. Both awards were reasonable on both fact and law, accordingly. The landlord's appeal was dismissed.","The tenants were given short written notice to vacate their apartment unit. The tenants applied under the Residential Tenancies Act for the return of their security deposit and damages including moving expenses. The landlord was out of country at the time of the hearing but authorized by letter that the caretaker would attend the hearing to represent the landlord. The caretaker confirmed the tenants endured a protracted plumbing problem and restriction on bathroom use in the apartment. The hearing officer awarded the tenants half of the actual moving cost and 1 year of rent abatement. The landlord appealed the hearing officer's decision. The landlord alleged that he was not given the opportunity to be heard or to adequately respond to the tenants' claim as he received inadequate notice and alleged that the award of damages was unreasonable. HELD: The landlord's appeal was dismissed. 1) The tenant gave notice of his claim by two separate documents and the landlord showed no misapprehension of the tenants' position based on his written response. The landlord did not indicate in his letter that the caretaker had a limited role and the landlord could have sought an adjournment but did not.  2) Section 70(6)(c) of the Act empowers the hearing officer to order payment of damages where the hearing officer considers it just and equitable. The wording of this provision is broad and unconstrained excepting that the nature of damages that may be imposed must not be punitive. The decision on rent abatement was principled and to compensate the tenants for their loss of use of usable space. The award for moving costs was intended to compensate for inconvenience, aggravation and related expenses. The awards were reasonable both in fact and law and no reviewable error was made by the hearing officer. Corrigendum released dated November 15, 2011 and added to fulltext."
"The petitioner manufactures log-home packages near Weyakwin, under the direction of Garry Varga, the sole director of the company. As a result of what the manufacture of these packages entails, both the company and Varga were convicted in Provincial Court of operating a forest products processing facility without a licence, contrary to s.18.1 of The Forest Resources Management Act, S.S. 1996. In consequence, each was fined and ordered to pay a surcharge. The Attorney General applied to the Court of Queen's Bench for leave to appeal on the grounds the judge misconstrued the licensing provisions of the Act and hence misapplied them. HELD: Appeal allowed. The convictions must stand. The matter need not have been taken up in the context of this case, at least not in the extent and to the effect the judge of Queen’s Bench thought appropriate. The fines and surcharges are nothing in the case to suggest we might interfere with the decision of the trial judge, so they stand.","The Crown applied for leave to appeal a Queen's Bench decision that set aside the convictions of the respondents, Chisum Log Homes and Lumber Ltd. and its sole director, Varga, for operating a forest products processing facility without a licence, contrary to s. 18.1 of The Forest Resources Management Act. The charges had stemmed from the manufacture of log-home packages by the company under the direction of Varga. The manufacture of these packages entailed the purchase of felled trees harvested by others from Crown lands. The logs were then cut at the respondents' facility into various lengths and notched, marked for construction and assembled into log-home packages. In the appeal to Queen's Bench of the convictions, the judge found that these steps in the manufacture of the packages did not engage the licencing provisions of the Act. HELD: The Court gave leave to appeal and allowed the appeal. Based on the definitions provided in s. 2 of the Act with respect to the words 'processing facility', 'forest products', and 'manufacture', it found that the operation of the facility by the company and Varga without a processing facility licence was unlawful as being contrary to s. 18.1. As the Provincial Court judge's conclusion was correct, the Court held that the convictions must stand and did not interfere with the fines and surcharges imposed upon the respondents."
"This appeal concerns the application of s. of the Limitation of Civil Rights Act (LCRA) in relation to a motion for deficiency judgment by the respondent bank. The main issue relates to how the proceeds of sale of property by judicial listing should be applied against a mortgage balance when there are both purchase money and non-purchase money balances. HELD: Appeal allowed.  1) The appeal is allowed with respect to the amount of the deficiency judgment. The appeal revolves around s. 2 of the LCRA. Where land is hereafter sold under an agreement for sale in writing, or mortgaged whether by legal or equitable mortgage for the purpose of securing the purchase price of the land affected, or where mortgage is hereafter given as collateral security for the sale price of that land, the vendor's or purchaser's interest payments are to be divided and applied proportionately. 2) The decision in Andrew (CA) was not binding and the reasons in Hrynewich Holdings should guide the disposition of this appeal.  3) The interest payments on the loan attributable to the purchase of the property attributable to that portion of the loan is to be paid against the purchase money portion. 4) The proceeds of the sale be applied to the total balance owing of the mortgage. 5) The respondent is entitled to take out a deficiency judgment against the appellants. 6) The LCRA should be interpreted liberally thereby permitting the sale proceeds ($372,444.01) to be applied, the non-Purchase money portion to be used and the balance owed on the purchase (non-purch) money portion are added to the balance.  7) The court reviewed the decisions in Andrew and found that the conclusion reached in CA was not the same as that reached in the respondent's case. 8) The conclusion in Andrew is not binding.","Statutes – Interpretation – Limitation of Civil Rights Act, Section 2The appellants had granted a residential mortgage in favour of the respondent that secured a loan in the amount of $460,800. The loan was a consolidation of existing debt, part of which was the balance of $373,089 owed on the original loan that had enabled the appellants to purchase the land. The remaining $87,711 was non-purchase money financing approved by the respondent. The appellants fell into default, and the respondent commenced foreclosure proceedings when the balance owed had increased to $536,186. The property was sold through judicial listing orders and the net sale proceeds were paid to the respondent. As the proceeds were insufficient, the respondent sought an order entitling it to the deficiency. The Chambers judge considered s. 2 of The Limitation of Civil Rights Act (LCRA) and held that the amount of the deficiency should be $162,675.99. The issues on appeal were how the proceeds of sale should be applied against the mortgage balance and what the proper amount of the deficiency was. HELD: The appeal was allowed. The court reviewed the purpose and policy behind the LCRA. It then examined its conflicting decisions in Hrynewich Holdings and Andrews and held that the latter was a per incuriam judgment and therefore not binding and the approach set out in Hrynewich would guide the disposition of this appeal. Therefore, it found with respect to each issue that the holding in Hrynewich meant that payments should be allocated on a pro-rated basis to purchase money and non-purchase money debt balances and the proper amount of the deficiency to which the respondent was entitled to judgment against the appellants was $31,160.23."
"In a reserved decision, the trial judge found that the respondent was entitled to a certificate of title under the Act to certain lands including the six acre portion in dispute and to a permanent injunction restraining the appellant and her assigns from using the said lands in any way whatsoever. The appellant appealed. Dismissing the appeal with costs, that the evidence showed that a conventional line had been drawn between the respondent's lands and the meadowlands in dispute, and that if the respondent had title to the disputed lands it would be extinguished by possession by herself alone and in privity with others.","The appellant and respondent were adjoining landowners both claiming title to a portion of meadowland described as interval. Both held their property by deeds obtained at tax sales. Dismissing the appeal, that the respondent was entitled to a certificate of title to the land and a permanent injunction restraining the appellant from using said lands. The meaning of the word interval in describing lands in North America was discussed."
"The issues were custody and access, child and spousal support and division of the matrimonial property. The wife had petitioned in 1991 for custody of the children and in 1992 Osborn granted interim maintenance in the amount of $400 per month. The husband counter-petitioned in 1992 for division of property. HELD: 1)An award for retroactive support and maintenance sought by the wife must be rejected. She had a beneficial interest created by the order of the court sufficient to support the registration of a caveat in the following lands to the extent of $50,711.66. 2)The Saskatchewan Teachers' Superannuation Commission was to transfer the sum of $30,000 to an RRSP as may be prescribed by the mother. 3)The mother was to apply to the court for a sale of the lands to facilitate the access of her children. 4)The father was to pay the sum to the wife for her support and $800 per month for the maintenance of the two children. 5)The RRSP would not transfer, lease or otherwise encumber the lands except in accordance with an order of court. 6)The parties agreed to a kind of specified access which should be put in place.","The wife petitioned and the husband counter-petitioned for a division of matrimonial property, custody, access and spousal and child support. HELD: 1)The matrimonial property was valued and divided equally. The wife was permitted to register a caveat to protect the value of her 1/2 interest. If the husband did not arrange payment by September 1st next, the wife was given leave to apply for a sale. 2)The wife was given custody of the 2 children of the marriage.  The court ordered specific access for the husband. 3)The court confirmed the interim support orders made before trial in the amounts of $400.00 per month for the wife, $400.00 per month for the oldest child, and $800.00 per month for the youngest child, who was handicapped."
"The plaintiff commenced an action against A., claiming damages as a result of the sexual assaults. A. did not defend the action. HELD: The plaintiff suffered damages in the amount of $50,000.  1)The functional approach should be utilized assessing the compensation required to provide the injured person with reasonable solace. Damages must be assessed primarily with respect to her non-pecuniary loss. 2)The psychological trauma and loss of amenities of life had been severe. She would continue to suffer for an appreciable period of time. 3)The Court determined that the discrepancies between the amounts awarded by various courts in sexual assault cases could not be reconciled. Many awards did not reflect any appreciable degree of comprehension of the extent of the damage incurred by the victim.","The Plaintiff sued her stepfather for damages for sexual assault. He had previously been convicted of a criminal charge based upon the same incident. He did not defend the civil proceedings and the Plaintiff applied to have her damages assessed. The evidence in the civil trial also disclosed that the Plaintiff had be sexually assaulted by her uncle. HELD: Judgment for the Plaintiff. 1)The Plaintiff had been diagnosed as suffering from severe psychological problems as a result of the sexual assaults. 2)The Court assessed the Plaintiff's non-pecuniary damages at $50,000.00 and apportioned 80% of this sum or $40,000.00 to the step-father. 3)The Plaintiff was also awarded $25,000.00 in punitive damages as against the stepfather."
"The Municipality sold a tax sale property owned by the plaintiffs to the defendant. Because of disputes over ownership between the plaintiffs and the defendant, the latter commenced an action against the plaintiffs seeking a declaration as to the validity of the tax sale. The Municipality later sued the plaintiffs for general damages resulting in the plaintiff taking possession of the property. The plaintiff winterized the property leaving it as it always was. Legal costs incurred as result of the action were set forth at $39,385.82. The Court of Appeal apportioned liability between the municipality and the Director of Assessment at 50% each. The present action is by the defendants in that first case to recover its legal fees together with some other items of loss and general damages. The specific items of damage claimed as being caused by vandalism or would have occurred in any event to a property left vacant through winter months are to be considered. Such damage as claimed occurred and did so when the plaintiffs were out of possession and the defendants must be held responsible. An award of general damages may not lie against the defendants only in an event arising out of a void tax sale held to be void.","The defendant municipality sold property owned by the plaintiffs at a tax sale. Because of disputes over ownership between the plaintiffs and the purchaser, the latter commenced an action against the plaintiffs seeking a declaration as to the validity of the tax deed. The deed was held to be valid at trial, but the tax sale was found to be void on appeal. The plaintiffs sought to recover their legal fees from the municipality and the Attorney General together with some other items of loss and general damages. Awarding damages to the property while the plaintiffs were out of possession and bank interest for the same period, that there is no evidence to warrant an award for general damages. Furthermore, no legal fees awarded, as they were too remote and unforeseeable."
"The common law wife of the insured was injured when her car was hit from behind by the defendant's vehicle. The insurance company claimed the plaintiff had not indicated any interest in claiming repayment of the monies paid under its Schedule B insurance policy until after the accident. The plaintiff brought an action against the defendant and its insurer, the Guardian Insurance Company, claiming that the plaintiff was not employed at the time of the accident and that she had not shown interest in making the repayment. The defendant argued that since the insurance company had not made any payments to the plaintiff prior to the accident, it would not be equitable to allow the insurer to enforce its strict legal rights. Awarding the plaintiff $140 for loss of income, that the defendant acted expeditiously to comply with its contractual obligation on the basis of the representations put forward on behalf of the plaintiff, to provide income replacement when the need was made apparent to it. It would be in the best interest of the court to prevent the insurance companies from getting its money back when it is found that the benefits were paid for by the plaintiff and were not being paid out. This was an arms length problem for the plaintiff who faced the prospect of losing her unemployment benefits for the first time in her life. It was impossible to find the plaintiff working for the defendant when she was only 17 years old.","The plaintiff was injured as a result of a motor vehicle accident. The defendant was found liable. At issue was the claim of the plaintiff against the defendant's insurer for Section B benefits. The defendant paid benefits for 129 weeks. It claimed that the plaintiff misrepresented her employment status at the time of the accident, and that the benefits should be re-paid. The plaintiff argued in response that the defendant was estopped from claiming repayment. Ordering the benefits be re-paid, that the defendant acted expeditiously to comply with its contractual obligation, on the basis of representations put forward on behalf of the plaintiff, to provide income replacement when the need was made apparent to it. It would be illogical to prevent the defendant from getting its money back when it is found that the benefits were paid on the basis of faulty information provided by the plaintiff. This is not a situation in which estoppel lies against the defendant."
"The accused was charged with having consumed alcohol in such a quantity that the concentration in his blood exceeded 80 milligrams of alcohol in 100 millilitres of blood contrary to s.253(b) and s.255(1) of the Criminal Code. The Crown called as witnesses the boyfriend of the accused's sister-in-law and the doctor of a civilian who at the time of trial was an inmate. The accused testified at trial that he had had the doctor complete the wrong form for the wrong reason and that the doctor advised him that the taking of the blood samples for law enforcement purposes would not endanger his life or health. HELD: On the evidence as whole, the Crown has established beyond a reasonable doubt that the blood was either taken personally by the accused or was taken by a technician under his supervision. The Court concludes that the facts that were in the mind of the officer when he decided to make the demand did amount to reasonable and probable grounds for his doing so. 1)The Court concludes the facts as set out in s.258(1)(h) permits proof by certificate of certain matters (certificate of competent medical practitioner or doctor) of which the Court determines that the Certificate of Qualified Medical Practitioner or Certificate of Analysis is valid. 2)There is no evidence that the officer did ask permission of the doctor to take the blood. He signed the second certificate. The doctor clearly would not have done so if he were of the opinion that in doing so there would be any danger to the life of his patient. 3)There was nothing in the evidence to suggest that the physician gave a valid opinion as to whether the Taking of the Blood Sample Would Not Endanger the Life or Health of the Accused. The facts established by the Court establish that the accused would have acted to prevent any occurrence that would have endangered the life and health of his client if the Certificate had been issued to him as a result of the accident.  4)Upon review of the evidence, the Court concluded that the medical practitioner's opinion, based on normal practise not specific memory, was not the basis for making a demand. The Certificate was valid. 5)The Certificate was not a valid reason to make a demand as it was not made in the presence of a qualified medical practitioner. The Certificates were signed by the doctor who supervised the examination of the samples and were examined by the officer for the purpose of assessing credibility.  6)Had the Court established that an additional sample was taken, the time when and place","The Crown withdrew one count at the opening of the trial and the accused was charged with operating a motor vehicle while having a blood alcohol concentration in excess of .08 contrary to s.253(b) and s.255(1) of the Criminal Code. In issue was whether the police officer had reasonable and probable grounds to make the breath demand; whether the demand met the requirements of the sample being taken by or under supervision of a medical practioner; whether the officer actually obtained information that taking the sample would not endanger the accused's life; whether the accused gave valid consent; whether the blood samples were taken as soon as practicable; whether the Crown could rely on the certificate where there was a reasonable doubt as to whether the physician took the sample himself or supervised a technician. HELD: The accused was found guilty. There was no basis on the evidence as a whole to exclude the Certificate of Analysis, which established the accused's blood alcohol level was 1.59 at the time of driving. 1)The officer had reasonable and probable grounds when he made the demand, including the accused was in the driver's seat; the odour of alcohol; the open bottle of beer; the nature of the accident. 2)Although the medical certificate could not be accepted as proof of the facts set out therein, the Crown did prove beyond a reasonable doubt by other evidence all the matters that could have been proven by the certificate. There was a reasonable doubt as to whether the doctor addressed his mind to the facts and opinion to the truth of what he was certifying. The doctor's mind was directed to the medical needs of the patient. His evidence was based on normal practice - not specific memory. There was no other logical conclusion that either the doctor or technician took the samples. The doctor would not have given permission to take samples if there was any danger to the life or health of his patient. 3)Since the officer had reasonable and probable grounds to make a demand for a sample of blood, the accused's consent was not required. 4)The officer proceeded with all due diligence and without any necessary delay. The blood was taken within a reasonably prompt time under all the circumstances.  5)The accused's admission that the accident affected his memory of the events following it and had no recollection of having passed the other vehicle just prior and that he was not driving like he normally drove and was perhaps going too fast for the road conditions (the gravel road was a wash board but was not at its worst condition) were noted."
"An action for divorce based on separation. In issue were custody, access, child support, spousal maintenance and division of the matrimonial home. The petitioner sought costs. HELD: 1)The marriage breakdown was established. The parties had been living separate and apart since January 1998. The divorce was granted.  2)The petitioner was not earning enough from her part-time employment to contribute other than nominally to the support of the husband. Maintenance for the couple's two children was to be determined in accordance with the Federal Child Support Guidelines. 3)The respondent was ordered to convey one-half of the commuted value of $21,804.38 to a locked-in RRSP in the name of the petitioner and to designate the children as beneficiaries of his life insurance for a period of time as, in the case of each child, that child continues to be a child of the marriage as defined in the Divorce Act.  4)Spousal support in the form of $900 per month payable every month commencing January 1/01/2001 was reduced to $485 subject to any additions pursuant to s.7. 5)The parties had agreed on joint custody of the children in addition to the loans from the Canada Trust secured against the title to the property, and that the parties would equally share the children's time during school vacations.  6)Costs were to be divided according to the formula adopted in Hamel v. Heron (2000), 157 Nfld. P.E.I.R. 42 (Sask. Q.B.). 7)Each party was to contribute his proportionate share of the orthodontic treatment expenses for the children that is not covered by insurance. 8)The wife was to convey half of her share to the respondent for the purposes of distribution pursuant to the Matrimonial Property Act, 1997. 9)Any adjustments would involve considerable speculation and the court was not prepared to allow such speculation. 10)The court ordered that the value of the termination benefit as of the date of the petition was $27,333.50 and that it should be divided 73 percent.","The divorce action was based on separation for more than a year.  In issue were custody and access, child support, spousal maintenance, possession and division of matrimonial property. HELD: 1)Divorce was granted. The parties, married 19 years, had been living separate and apart since January 1998. 2)They agreed to joint custody of both children. The son was to reside primarily with his father. The daughter resided with her mother. Access was essentially reciprocal on alternative weekends. The children were to be together most weekends. School vacations would be shared. 3)The father was to pay monthly child support of $485 based on his gross salary of $61,200 which included a $1500 car allowance. Expenses for music lessons, band and extracurricular school activities did not qualify as a special or extraordinary expense. The father was to contribute his proportionate share (73% to reflect spousal maintenance) of orthodontic expenses not covered by insurance. 4)Spousal maintenance of $900 was to be reviewable after December 31, 2003. The mother's job advancement was impeded as a result of the marriage, specifically by frequent moves to accommodate her husband's job transfers. She had worked out of the home for limited income to facilitate child rearing. 5)The parties agreed the matrimonial home would be sold and proceeds divided equally after payment of expenses of the sale. Costs of any major repairs were to be split equally pending the sale. The petitioner was entitled to occupy the property and was to pay the mortgage, insurance, utilities and other usual costs.  6)It was inferred the value of the chattels was the same as that at the date of the marriage. It would be inequitable to order a distribution of chattel property given as antiques or heirlooms by her parents valued in excess of $6,000. The inheritance from her aunt who died almost a year after the separation was excluded. The motor vehicles were divided in accordance with their value as of October 2000. All other matrimonial property and debts and obligations were valued as of the date of the petition. RRSPs were to be equalized as of October 15, 1999 by rollover. 7)The respondent was to convey one-half of the commuted value of his pension at date of the petition to a locked in RRSP in the name of the petitioner. The balance in excess of the maximum amount transferable under the Pension Benefits Act resulted in an adjustment of $2,042.75. The respondent was to assume any debts.  8)No costs were awarded."
"The mother appealed an order which, in response to an application by the father to vary a child maintenance order, reduced his child maintenance obligation to $1.00 per month. The father had never paid any child support voluntarily under the previous orders and was in default of the disclosure provision in Justice MacLellan's order. He applied to vary the maintenance order even though he had not made adequate disclosure of his financial situation. HELD: Appeal allowed in part; dismissal of the application without prejudice to his bringing a new variation application on proper material; the court erred in allowing the application to proceed even though the father had not disclosed his income for the 2002 and 2003 years; only in rare circumstances should a party applying to reduce a child support be heard absent that party making full disclosure.","The father, who was in arrears under an order requiring him to pay child support, applied to vary the support order which had been made less than a year before. He failed to make the required financial disclosure and relied on a medical disability of which he gave no prior notice. The judge allowed the application to proceed, over the objections of the mother, and reduced the child support obligation to $1 per month. The mother appealed. Appeal allowed; the judge's decision to allow the application to proceed was procedurally unfair to the appellant and wrong in principle. Only in rare circumstances should a party applying to reduce child support be heard absent that party making full disclosure."
"The accused was charged with driving a motor vehicle while his ability to do so was impaired (under s. 253(1)(a)) and while his blood alcohol concentration exceeded the legal limit of.08 (under S. 253)(1)(b)) and with failing to stop for police as soon as reasonable in the circumstances. HELD: The accused was found not guilty of driving while his Ability to Drive was impaired and that his blood-alcohol concentration was over the legal maximum at the time he approached the police officer. The accused's argument that he had only consumed six beer at the station and then had to listen to music while he was arrested raises a reasonable doubt that his Blood Alcohol Count was over 80 mg% at the moment he got out of his vehicle and approached the officer.  1) The accused admitted that he was drinking alcohol that evening and that this factor, taken together with the time since this day, has effected his recollection of this day and what he drank. 2) The Court was satisfied that the accused was drinking beer steadily over the hours before he drove and that he did so to evade the police. His blood alcohol content was over.08 at the conclusion of the pursuit. The Court rejected the accused's contention that he wasn't trying to evade this police officer and accepted the evidence of Cst. Cobbledick. 3) The evidence of the last drink was not a credible account of the accused’s alcohol consumption as he was concerned about losing his licence and having his vehicle seized. The drinking history of the officer was different in terms of both the amount of beer and hard liquor consumed and the time the hard liquor was consumed than the one given by the accused. The defence offered a credible explanation for the accused drinking more beer than was reasonable in order to avoid arrest. The only witness was alcohol expert Mary Ellen Scott. She gave opinion evidence based on the drinking history the accused gave at trial. She found that the defence offered no credible explanation as to how the accused had come to the conclusion that he consumed six or more beer in the evening and then drove to the police station and refused to stop, saying his reason for doing so was to avoid seizure of his truck. The Certificate of Analysis was based on a different drinking pattern. The officer said he assumed that the drinking pattern of the individual he spoke to in the course of driving was different. He assumed that he would be 'home free' if he reached his driveway. The BAC readings were based on his own drinking pattern and the factors","Criminal Law – Evidence – CredibilityCriminal Law – Evidence – Expert Evidence – Blood Alcohol ConcentrationCriminal Law – Impaired Driving – Blood Alcohol Level Exceeding .08 The accused was charged with three Criminal Code offences: driving while impaired, contrary to s. 253(1)(a); driving over .08, contrary to s. 153(1)(b); and with failing to stop for a police officer as soon as reasonable in order to evade that officer, contrary to s. 249.1(2)). As he was completing a traffic stop, an officer heard the accused’s truck in the early morning hours. When the officer engaged his police vehicle emergency lights, the accused spun his tires, fish-tailed, and took off. The accused failed to stop at two stop signs and eventually stopped in the driveway of his house. The accused was arrested for the s. 249.1 offence and was given a breath demand after he failed as ASD. He failed the ASD between 3:01 and 3:03 and the breath samples were taken at 3:55 and 4:17. The accused admitted that he was drinking alcohol that evening, but denied being impaired. He said he was not trying to evade the officer when he failed to stop for him. He also said that alcohol he had just had was not in his system yet when he was driving, but was at the time of the breath samples. The officer indicated that the accused had glossy, watery eyes, but his walk and speech were fairly normal. The officer smelled alcohol coming from the accused, but was surprised he did not show more impairment given his driving. The accused indicated that he had consumed six beer that day, but the officer noted more than six empty beer cans on the accused’s table when he was getting his shoes. The accused indicated that he downed six or seven ounces of vodka just before driving at 2:45. An alcohol expert and the accused testified. The defence expert testified that the accused’s blood alcohol concentration (BAC) at the time of driving would not have been over .08 based on the drinking the accused testified to. The issues were: 1) whether there was proof beyond a reasonable doubt that the accused’s ability to drive was impaired by alcohol; 2) whether the accused’s evidence raised a reasonable doubt that his blood alcohol concentration was over the legal limit at the time when he finally stopped his vehicle; and 3) whether the accused had reasonable excuse for not stopping immediately for the officer and whether his actions amounted to him evading the police officer. The accused had nine drinking and driving convictions since 1982 with the most recent in 2007. HELD: The issues were determined as follows: 1) the Crown did not prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the accused’s ability to drive was impaired; 2) section 258(1)(d.1) deals with the last drink defence. The court had to be satisfied that the accused’s drinking was consistent with his BAC being not over .08 at the time of driving yet being consistent with the BAC’s in the Certificate of Analysis. The court preferred the officer’s evidence over the accused’s, given the drinking affected his recollections. The court was not satisfied that the defence provided a credible account of the accused’s alcohol consumption. Given the findings, the court was unable to apply the expert’s opinions. The court did not have a reasonable doubt regarding the accused’s guilt on the driving while over .08 charge; and 3) there was no doubt that the accused knew he was being pursued by the police and did not stop as soon as was reasonable in the circumstances. The court concluded that the accused did not have a reasonable excuse for not stopping. There was also no doubt that the accused attempted to get away from the officer because he was afraid of the legal consequences that he could face. The accused was found guilty of the evading charge."
"The appellant was acquitted after trial in the Provincial Court of communicating with another person for the purpose of engaging in prostitution, contrary to s. 213(1)(c) of the Code. However, on appeal to the Court of Queen's Bench a new trial was ordered, and in that judgment, a new verdict was ordered. HELD: The Court of Appeal held that a new Trial was ordered and that it was from that judgment that this appeal arose. The Queen’s Bench judge interpreted her oral reasons to include a requirement as an element of the actus reus for an offence under s 213 that there be a specific conversation with respect to payment of money for specified sexual services. The appellant was not adding the need for specific conversation. The fact that the conversation did not reach the point where the matter of payment was discussed would not preclude a jury from reasonably concluding that an act of prostitution involving the payment of payments for sexual favours was contemplated. The Court also held that if the Provincial court judge had found that under s.213 the s.8 reus must include a particular conversation specifying the sexual services and the money to be paid for them, she was incorrect.",The appellant was acquitted of communicating with another person for the purpose of prostitution. A new trial was ordered on the basis that the Provincial Court judge included a requirement as an element of the actus reus for an offence under s.213 that there be a specific conversation with the respect to payment of money for specified sexual services. The Queen's Bench judge concluded that this was an error in law and cited as a correct test that set out in R. v. Schmidt. HELD: The proper disposition is to set aside the judgment and restore the decision of the Provincial Court acquitting the appellant of the offence. 1)On reading the entire oral judgment the court concluded that the judge was saying in effect that the evidence failed to convince her beyond a reasonable doubt that the offence had taken place. 2)The trial judge was incorrect in finding that under s.213 the actus reus must include a specific conversation specifying the sexual services and the money to be paid.
"The plaintiff applied for an order pursuant to s.55 of the Automobile Accident Insurance Act requiring Saskatchewan Government Insurance to pay to the plaintiff the amount awarded to her in a 1998 judgment. The defendant applied to set aside the judgment and striking out the plaintiff's claim. HELD: There must be a declaration that the plaintiff was precluded, by s.102 of the Act, from commencing a valid legal action with the result that the judgment obtained is a nullity. 1)The wording in s. 102(a) of the act is indistinguishable from the wording in S. 143(1) of The Vehicles Act, 1983. No action may be brought against person for the recovery of damages occasioned by motor vehicle after 12 months from the time that the damages were sustained. 2) There is no order as to costs.","Plaintiff applied for an order pursuant to s.55 of the AAIA requiring SGI to pay to the plaintiff the amount awarded to her in an earlier judgment. The defendant has applied for an order setting aside the judgment and striking out the plaintiff's claim. A car-pedestrian accident occurred causing personal injury to the plaintiff. The defendant was convicted of dangerous driving under the Criminal Code. The plaintiff sued for battery and assault. The defendant was noted for default on this claim and the damages were assessed at $37,717.35, $10,000 of which were punitive. The plaintiff submits that s.102 of the Act should not deprive a citizen of the right to sue a defendant for injuries caused by assault, battery, fraud, or similar torts. HELD: The plaintiff has no cause for action by virtue of her injuries having been caused by an automobile. The plaintiff was precluded by s.102 of the Act from commencing a valid legal action with the result that the judgment obtained is a nullity. Although s.102 of the Act prohibits certain types of law suits, the act provides victims with compensation for injury. No order as to costs."
"The plaintiff/defendant sought reimbursement of monies advanced under the contract and expenses it incurred for equipment rentals and other activities it claimed were required because of the failure of Roper Ltd. to perform the contract. The defendant counterclaimed for damages arising out of losses it suffered due to the unjustified termination of the contract, and as extras for services it had never been paid for. The contractual obligation to'maintain the banks' was to be construed by the wording in the contract as being the contract between the parties and as being a reimbursement claim. The court found that although the equipment supplied by the defendant was not the same type and model as it listed in the response to the tender, it had been used in similar fashion to the equipment brought on site by the plaintiff. As well, the defendant acknowledged that it had used some of the same equipment as it had in the prior tender. The plaintiff was entitled to reimbursement for monies it had received from the defendant, and incurred expenses it did not wish to incur. As for the plaintiff's claim, it was not entitled to recover its monies from the sale of the coal, nor was it entitled to extras for which it was never paid. On the facts, the plaintiff was wrong to object to the defendant's request for reimbursement. There was no evidence that the defendant acted under the purchase order as it was inconsistent with the terms and specifications in the original tender.","The defendant obtained a tender to bank, blend and load coal at the plaintiff's coal preparation plant. In performing the contract, the defendant experienced equipment problems resulting in the plaintiff having to rent equipment from the defendant's predecessor. The plaintiff terminated the contract without any prior warning or notice to the defendant and brought an action for reimbursement of monies advanced under the contract and expenses incurred for the equipment rentals. The defendant counter-claimed for damages arising out of the termination of the contract, for services performed under the contract and for extras which had not been paid. Plaintiff entitled to reimbursement for overpayments and equipment rentals; defendant entitled to fair and reasonable compensation for extras for which court awarded the sum of $10,000. Both parties were in breach of the contract, the plaintiff's breach occurring because the volumes of coal supplied did not approximate the tonnages represented in the contractual documents. The clause excluding liability for errors in the forecast did not excuse the plaintiff because the actual volumes were not even approximate to the forecasted tonnages and the rates bid by the defendant were directly related to the anticipated tonnages. Absent evidence as to how the plaintiff arrived at the information used in the calculation of the forecasted tonnages, no negligent misrepresentation could be found, as there was no evidence that the information was negligently obtained. In respect to claims where on the evidence there was a loss, but it was difficult, if not impossible to quantify, damages were awarded even where it could be said the amount is a matter of guesswork."
"The Crown appeals a conditional sentence of two years less one-day imposed on the respondent after he pled guilty to the following charges: breaking and entering a dwelling house; breaking and breaking and leaving jewellery and other stolen goods; breaking into a dwelling property and committing the theft; being at large on his undertaking given to a justice or a judge and being bound to comply with a condition of keeping the peace and be of good behaviour failing without lawful excuse to complywith that condition contrary to s. 145(3) of the Criminal Code; breaking, entering and breaking again; all of these offences were committed within the meaning of the conditional sentence imposed. The Crown had sought a penitentiary sentence and the sentencing judge had responded by saying that when one reviews the record it is easy to understand the position taken by the Crown which is for a penitential sentence. The sentencing judge acknowledged the respondent's alcohol problem, his three and one-half years of sobriety, and that the respondent spent time on remand. She also considered a positive pre-sentence report and the fact the respondent had spent time in remand to be factors in the decision. The sentence should have been imposed sooner.","The Crown appealed a conditional sentence of 2 years less a day imposed after the respondent pled guilty to three break and enters of dwelling houses and theft and possession of stolen property in February and March as well as two breaches of undertakings in March and June 2000. HELD: The conditional provision was removed as time spent on electronic monitoring and post sentence efforts were considered. A conditional sentence was not available in the circumstances. The 38 year old had 49 prior convictions. The sentencing judge noted the accused's 3.5 years of sobriety, community support, education and technical trade training, and positive pre-sentence report but failed to consider the gravity of the offences, the need for deterrence, and above all, protection of the public. The respondent had no sooner finished parole than he began to commit these crimes."
"The plaintiff commenced his class action in June 2006 against the defendants and third parties. The defendants appealed that decision and applied to stay the action pending review by the Queen's Bench Rules of Court. The applicants applied to the Court to stay either permanently or on an interim basis, the plaintiff's claim commenced pursuant to The Class Actions Act. They argued that the actions were an abuse of the court's process and that the court had the statutory and inherent jurisdiction to order the action stayed. The Court referred to the recent amendments to the Sask. Act which provide for a discretionary order pursuant to s. 37(1) of the Queen’s Bench Rules and/or Rule 173 of the Queens’ Bench Rules. HELD: The Court found that virtually all of the concerns raised by the applicants in support of their stay applications were addressed in the preliminary application. The application to stay was premature and an unnecessary duplication of resources and time. The court reviewed the circumstances before it and found that s. 6 of the Act was applicable. The Saskatchewan Act does not provide an appropriate remedy for this type of application. As the Act is presently undergoing a refresh, the Court was cognizant of the fact that the application could be brought at any time in any of the jurisdictions except Newfoundland and Labrador. As a result, the court was unable to determine whether the action should be stayed permanently or in interim. The applications to stay were dismissed.","FIAT: Each of the defendants and third parties (collectively the 'applicants'), apply to stay either permanently or on an interim basis the plaintiffs' claim commenced pursuant to The Class Actions Act. The stay applications seek the same discretionary order of the court pursuant to s. 37(1) of The Queen's Bench Act, 1998 and/or Rule 173 of the Queen's Bench Rules. The plaintiff's action claims damages for injuries that are alleged to have been caused by the testing and application of herbicides at a Canadian Forces base in New Brunswick. To date 11 statements of claim have been filed across Canada, 9 by Merchant Law Group (MLG). MLG has proceeded with various stages of the class action proceeding which it has commenced through the various jurisdictions in Canada as it has considered to be to the best advantage of the plaintiffs which that firm represents or seeks to represent. Now Saskatchewan is the clear preference. Many of these strategic decisions are driven by the nature of state of class actions legislation in the various jurisdictions in which claims were commenced. The applicants claim these strategic decisions are and do constitute an abuse of process. They claim they are a costly expenditure of time and money. The applicants have already participated in certification hearings in Newfoundland and New Brunswick. The issue on this application is whether the Saskatchewan action should be stayed permanently or on an interim basis with or without conditions on the basis of abuse of process. HELD: The applications to stay, on either an interim or permanent basis, the Saskatchewan action are dismissed. 1) The Court has concluded that virtually all, if not all of the concerns raised by the applicants in support of their stay applications are intended to be, and for that matter, mandated to be considered by the court during the certification application of this class action.  'Traffic control' as between the nine or ten existing class actions commenced in the other provincial jurisdictions is the responsibility of this Court upon certification as now required by s. 6(2) and s. 6(3) of the Act. The objectives and relevant factors by which the court is to be guided and which it must consider involve the very considerations upon which the applicants base their stay applications. They include avoiding, where possible, the risk of irreconcilable judgments, the promotion of judicial economy, the consideration of the law applicable, the stage each action has reached, the plan for the proposed multi-jurisdictional class action and the location of the representative plaintiffs, class members, evidence and witnesses. The discretion granted by the legislature to the court with respect to any certification orders it may issue as outlined in s. 6.1 of the Act is very broad. That discretion must be exercised having regard to the criterion set out in s. 6(2) of the Act. That may prompt a conclusion that deference should be given to an existing class action commenced in another jurisdiction. The discretion of the court is further circumscribed by the objectives and relevant factors set out in s. 6(3) of the Act. The concerns raised by the applicants in support of their stay application have been eclipsed. They are not specifically and legislatively required to be addressed by the court at the certification stage and after a certification hearing has been conducted. 2) Even if the criteria in Englund v. Pfizer Canada Inc., 2007 SKCA 62; were to be applied to the consideration of the stay applications presently before the Court, the Court would be inclined, in any event, to dismiss the stay applications in the facts and circumstances of this case. There are many differences between the proposed Saskatchewan class to be certified, its inclusiveness and exclusiveness, the nature of the injuries claims for, the substances alleged to have cause those injuries and the enumerated defendants or third parties in the actions commenced in each of the other jurisdictions. That alone, without the assistance of s. 6 and the other amending provisions of the Saskatchewan Act, distinguish this case from those criteria which the Court of Appeal applied in Englund to reach the conclusion that the action should be appropriately (but conditionally) stayed."
"The Mother sought to have the Father's access supervised. The Father had not had contact with the child since January 2010 and was an abuser of marijuana. The Mother was concerned that he would be able to obtain an Egyptian passport for the child and would be in danger of physical harm if he were left in the care of the Father. Both parties during the most recent incident had an opportunity to prevent escalation. The mother could have allowed the father to take the jacket and leave without getting into a tug-of-war with the father. The father did not admit to threats to harm the child nor about his placing her in situations where there were peanuts present. HELD: 1)Joint custody does not necessarily mean joint custody is inappropriate. 2)The Father is to attend a course in parenting such as those offered by Family SOS so that he will be informed about child development and understand how to appropriately parent the child. 3)There must be evidence to suggest there is a realistic likelihood that the Father would take the child away from the Mother and that this should be managed by utilizing the services provided by Veith House. If there is no reason to change the existing situation, that situation should continue until trial.","The parties' hostility prevented them from reaching an agreement on interim parenting arrangements for their two-and-a-half-year-old child. There was a no contact order in place pending the outcome of domestic violence charges against the father (who had not seen the child for four months). The mother had nothing positive to say about him. They disagreed about the extent of his marijuana use, and the extent of his involvement with the child. He agreed to abstain from drugs around the child and for 12 hours before access. The mother expressed concern the father was a flight risk because he was from Egypt and had family support outside the country. Sole custody to the mother, with supervised access for a period of time (to reintroduce the father to the child), moving to increasingly longer periods of daytime access. The father must complete a parenting course to better learn how to meet the child's various needs. There was insufficient evidence to show he is unable to protect the child from her severe nut allergy. There was insufficient evidence to establish he is a flight risk. Even if he had threatened to flee with the child, it is relevant that he lacks the means to do so. While there has been unpleasantness and some violence between the parties, the evidence does not establish domestic violence of a nature that would require supervised access on an ongoing basis."
"The father appealed a decision of the Chambers judge which varied the custody provisions of a consent judgment dated March 30, 2005 governing custody and access to the parties' children. The father argued that the chambers judge erred by failing to apply the principle of maximum contact, by applying a presumption of the status quo and by finding that evidence as to the wishes of the children was irrelevant. HELD: Appeal dismissed. 1) The Chambers judge correctly stated that s. 17(9) of the Act does not provide a sufficient basis for imposing a maximum contact principle on all of the evidence. 2) The evidentiary record as controverted as it is, is not lacking to the point where the judge had no proper basis for her decision. She was obliged to consider only the impact of the change in circumstances when making her determination; and 3) there was insufficient uncontroverted evidence on material issues which could not be used to support a decision made on affidavit evidence alone. In the context of conflicting evidence regarding the children's wishes, it is open to the judge to decline to make a finding on the issue and to proceed to base the decision on other factors. This argument cannot succeed.","The father appealed from the decision of the Chamber's judge which varied the custody provisions of a consent judgment. The father had been unsuccessful in arguing for a shared custody arrangement in the Court below. The father argued that the Chamber's judge erred in her application of the best interests of the children and failed to apply the principle of maximum contact by applying a presumption in favour of the status quo and finding that the wishes of the children were irrelevant. For the first time on appeal, the father also argued that there was insufficient uncontroverted evidence before the Chambers judge to allow her to make a proper decision. HELD: The appeal was dismissed. It is implicit in the Chamber's decision that there was sufficient evidence before the Court to reach a conclusion about the best interests of the children and to find a change in circumstances. No error was made on this issue. The Chamber's judge correctly applied the test to determine the best interests of the children as articulated in Gordon v. Goertz. The Chamber's judge correctly concluded that the Act does not provide that the maximum contact principle alone provides a sufficient basis for ordering shared parenting. She addressed this principle in the context of the children's best interests. There is no evidence that the Chamber's judge stopped her inquiry at the status quo and that she did not assess the children's best interests against the proposed new circumstances and its impact upon them. The Chamber's judge was entitled to give limited or no weight to the wishes of the children. There is no material error or misapprehension of the evidence."
"Appellant, twenty-eight years old, pled guilty to two offences. The theft of a computer and modem exceeding $1,000 in value, contrary to s.334(a) of the Criminal Code and mischief (s. 430(4)(a)) of the Code. He was sentenced to 18 months to be served concurrently with the theft charge. He appealed his sentence on the grounds that the sentence is unfair and the mischief charge is too long. Allowing the appeal, that while leave to appeal is granted, the appeal should be dismissed.",28 year old male with 19 previous theft and property related convictions - broke into a vehicle and stole a computer - damaged motor vehicle  -  18 months for theft and 12 months concurrent for mischief upheld on appeal.
"This was an appeal from the acquittal of the respondent on a charge of assaulting his wife. Appeal allowed; verdict of acquittal set aside; conviction entered on the charge of assault causing bodily harm. Both counsels for the respondent requested that the matter be remitted to trial judge for sentence as there was no medical evidence to support finding that he had the minimal intent required for an assault. HELD: The appeal was allowed and the sentence imposed. 1)The trial judge did not properly direct himself as to the type of evidence necessary to conclude, as a result of the appellant's degree of intoxication, that there was a reasonable doubt that the respondent had the intent to assault his estranged wife. 2)The Court was of the view that voluntary drunkenness is not generally defence to general intent but could be defence if the accused had an appreciation of the circumstances of the assault at the time, although he cannot remember. The'sack of potatoes defence' was not supported by any evidence. 3)The evidence showed that the appellant had the presence of mind to recognize her naked and to suggest to her that she get clothes on in case somebody came by. The wife's evidence did not indicate he had an understanding of the circumstance of the offence at the moment although he could not remember.",", The Crown appealed the acquittal of the respondent on a charge of assaulting his wife. The trial judge had found the respondent, who had taken a sleeping pill and was drunk at the time of the assault, did not have the intent to commit the assault. Allowing the appeal, that voluntary intoxication cannot be considered as raising a reasonable doubt as to intent in a general intent offence unless the degree of intoxication is so extreme that the accused did not even possess the minimal intent to perform the actus reus because his state was akin to automatism or insanity. The Court noted that no medical evidence as to the affect of the sleeping pill with the alcohol was adduced, nor was there any evidence concerning the strength of the pill or the amount of alcohol consumed and concluded that the evidence supported the conclusion that the respondent appreciated the circumstances of the assault, even though he could not remember it afterward. The Court set aside the acquittal and entered a verdict of guilty pursuant to s. 686(4)(b)(ii) of the Criminal Code as it had concluded that the respondent 'should have been found guilty but for the error in law'."
"Division of matrimonial property. Husband did not pursue livestock operation on the farm for a number of reasons. One of them was the fact that he required surgery on his back making it impossible for him to physically do the work. He made a voluntary assignment into bankruptcy in February 1994. As a result, he was asked in accordance with my prior judgment to complete the division of the property. In addition, the wife filed a motion seeking a variation of the spousal maintenance order made in November in light of his bankrupt financial situation. HELD: 1)The petitioner did pay $2,300 by way of maintenance out of the proceeds of certain barley sold privately. The respondent claims this was in violation of my original order prohibiting the sale of any assets without consent of the other party or the Court. 2)The wife was entitled to the set-off to be included in her share of the matrimonial property division. 3)The respondent was granted the privilege of auctioning off the cattle squeeze for $400 and the proceeds from such sale would normally go to satisfy the unsecured creditors of the respondent under his bankruptcy. 4)Allowing the wife's claim for set-offs, that the petitioner used assets to pay his legal fees, and that he should be granted the same privilege as the respondent in bankruptcy, that his claim for a similar amount of debt was problematic at best. 5)The court reviewed the value of the farm assets and found that they were in excess of the half-share of the petitioner's assets and constituted a party that will retain possession of the asset. The court awarded the respondent's asset value of $54,612 to the respondent and $42,400 to the wife. 6)Division on the basis of asset values. Asset values at this stage are problematical and indeed by including some assets which may not be exempt in whole or in part from the bankruptcy proceedings. Asset valuations determined by the trustee in bankruptcy. Each side shall bear their own costs.","This decision is supplementary to [1993]TWL QB93506. Applications to further divide matrimonial property and to vary spousal maintenance. The husband had declared personal bankruptcy since the date of the original orders obtained under the Matrimonial Property Act and Divorce Act. HELD: 1)The husband's obligation to pay maintenance was reduced to $1 per month and the arrears accruing after the date of his assignment into bankruptcy were cancelled.  2)The wife's counsel requested that the court value and divide all of the matrimonial property equally notwithstanding the bankruptcy, because she might pursue a constructive trust claim for her 1/2 share as against the husband's trustee. 3)The court valued all of the matrimonial property and determined that 56% of this value should be paid to the wife, and only 44% to the husband, given amounts he had spent since the separation.  4)The court left unresolved the issue of which matrimonial assets might be exempt under the Bankruptcy Act and therefore available to the wife."
The plaintiff sought an injunction restraining the defendants from engaging in secondary picketing on the premises of their employer. The picketers were obstructing the entrance to the employer's premises for up to 20 minutes and some of the employees were prevented from entering the premises for more than an hour. HELD: 1)The acts complained of were illegal and had caused and continue to cause loss and damage to the plaintiff including damage of the plaintiff's car. 2)The defendants were granted leave to file and serve materials. 3)The injunction was continued until the trial of the action. 4)The plaintiff was ordered to pay costs of the application. 5)The court was unable to find a clear and unequivocal precedent for this principle in any of the numerous decisions at all relevant to the question.,"PCL applied for an interlocutory injunction restraining the members of the Defendant unions from picketing the entrance to a construction site at which PCL was constructing an addition to the City's sewage treatment plant. The picketers were completely blocking the entrance to the construction site, were threatening the occupants of vehicles using the entrance and damaged one vehicle as it entered the site. No City employees were working on the site. ISSUES: 1)Is the picketing secondary picketing? 2)Is the manner of picketing unlawful in any event? HELD: Application allowed. 1)Picketing of the premises of an employer, where there is no direct dispute between him and the picketers or between him and his employees, is secondary picketing, is per se unlawful and cannot be jusified merely because the picketers are engaged in a legal strike against another employer who has business relations with the employer being picketed. 2)If the court had determined that the subject picketing was not secondary picketing, then, in the particular circumstances it would still have held that the subject picketing was unlawful, and ought to be restrained, as, on the whole of said evidence it was satisfied that the applicant had established that said picketing was not being carried on for the purpose of lawful communication, but, rather, was being carried on in a manner designed to obstruct, impede and interfere with the lawful performance by the applicant of its construction contract on the construction site."
"The defendants were charged with permitting a private building or facility, to remain on public reserve lands contrary to both the provisions of the Planning and Development Act and the Zoning Bylaws of the Resort Village.  The defendants claimed the bylaws of the resort Village were inapplicable and that, although their activities may constitute an offence under the provincial statute, the prosecution of it should be stayed as an abuse of the legal process, and a violation of their rights to be afforded 'equal protection and equal benefit of the law without discrimination' under Sec. 15 of the Charter. The charges were based on a misunderstanding of the applicable legislation. The defendants had agreed to allow the development of a boathouse on public reserves, but the proposal was never made public. The boathouses were on public land and the landowner claimed the right to use them as recreation. The City did not act to regulate the construction of the boathole or to protect its claim to the title. The Municipality stepped into that position and refused to prosecute the defendants. The case against the defendant was not new to the Court. It had been a long time since a boating establishment had been permitted on a public reserve. The fact that the condo owners had constructed their boathos on public lands and the fact that it was subject to the provincial bylaw does not change the fact the municipality stepped into the breach. The Court found that the municipality had not done anything to protect the public's right to know about the use of the reserve and, in fact, had been the subject of a considerable amount of litigation. The Defendants were charged for violating the bylaw respecting the use and enjoyment of the public reserve by building their buildings on public property. The defendant was charged with obstruction of a public park or swimming area. The court found that both the plaintiff and the defendant were trespassers. The plaintiff were ordered to pay costs.","The defendants permitted a private building to remain on public reserve lands contrary to s. 197 of The Planning and Development Act, 1983 and the zoning bylaws of the Resort Village of Echo Bay. They contended the bylaws were inapplicable. They conceded the activities may be an offence under the provincial statute, but submitted the selective prosecution should be stayed as an abuse of the legal process, and a violation of their right to 'equal protection and equal benefit of the law without discrimination' under s. 15 of the Charter. Legislation required 10% of land intended for subdivision to be given to the province. This land was designated as 'public reserve', and its use was limited by s. 197 of The Planning and Development Act, 1983. Most public reserves were not developed by the government, but rather by cottage owners. Some cottage owners asserted the public was able to use the construction on public reserve, and allowing such access made such construction things that 'facilitate the use of the reserve as a public recreation area' under s. 197(f) and were legal. In Echo Bay, the subdivision plan created a public reserve in front of cottage lots, vested in the province on October 25, 1983. The provincial Department of Municipal Government ('Department') was to determine what fell within s. 197. The province had no policing mechanism for violations. The Department acted as if maintaining the reserves was the municipality's responsibility, even though the province held title. In August 1986, Mr. and Mrs. Taillon built a boathouse on public reserve. They did not seek permission, as their realtor said they could treat the land as part of their lot. Their neighbour Mr. Zeah complained to Mr. Brickwell, the Senior Planner of the Department. This resulted in an enquiry into if the defendant's activities violated s. 197 or the municipal zoning bylaw. On October 28, 1986, Mr. Brickwell told the mayor that Department officials inspected the site and asked council to request the Taillons remove the structure. Council advised the Department on November 24, 1986 that it was not their land or responsibility. Mr. Brickwell informed council of proposed legislative amendments that would give title and enforcement responsibilities to municipalities. In June 1989, council asked Mr. Fraser to produce authority to construct his boathouse and if not, they would issue a stop work order under the zoning bylaws, even though they believed they did not apply to public reserves. Council was trying to avoid future problems once they heard of the amendments. They received no response and issued an order. Mr. Fraser then contacted Mr. Brickwell who told him there were numerous violations, but enforcement was lacking. Mr. Brickwell said he did not demand the boathouse be removed because, in his view, his Department did not police public reserves. On October 21, 1989, council passed a motion to turn the prosecution of violations of s. 197 over to the RCMP. The province was the landowner and enforcer of the Act, so it was appropriate for the RCMP to assume prosecution. The RCMP declined, and Mr. Brickwell informed council his Department would not act. On January 31, 1991, an amendment to The Planning and Development Act passed which allowed municipalities to take title and passed responsibility for prosecuting offenders to local councils. Echo Bay took title on July 6, 1992. On February 21, 1991, council's solicitor requested the defendants and the Fosters to remove their boathouses by June 31, 1991. The Fosters complied, but the defendants did not. On November 16, 1991, council proceeded with the action. Although council believed the boathouses were illegal, the Taillon boathouse was assessed for property taxes. Council believed they must prosecute offenders to fulfill their duty to uphold the law, discourage further violations, and ensure public reserve lands were open for public use. The defendants believed either none or all violators should be prosecuted. Council stated it was wiser to prosecute only boathouses to obtain the court's opinion. If council was correct, it may not be necessary to prosecute others because they might comply with the law as expressed by the court. If the court did not agree, council should not incur any further expense. Council asserted prosecution of boathouse owners was appropriate as boathouses caused the complaint, and they were clearly private. The defendants view their selection for prosecution out of a numerous violators as unfair and discriminatory within the prohibition of s. 15 of the Charter. HELD: A municipality may further restrict uses of reserve land, but it cannot allow uses not permitted by s. 197. Taxing the boathouse was immaterial and did not imply approval. The defendants were not misled as to their legal rights by a person in authority. The Taillons could not have believed the opinion of the realtor; they knew they did not own the land. Mr. Brickwell's comment that there were numerous violations being ignored could not be taken to mean the defendants were able to build on public reserve. It was an opinion that they might escape prosecution. The case turned on whether it was an abuse of the legal process to prosecute the defendants when other violators were ignored or a case of violating their rights under s. 15 of the Charter. How unfair it was depended on how many violators were overlooked which turned on the reading of s. 197. John Nanson, the Principal Planner of the Community Planning Services Branch, believed things on public reserve available to the public were not violations of s. 197. The court did not accept this view as it allowed citizens to determine what constituted a 'public facility' and required council to launch civil actions to remove private construction. If this was intended, no offence would be created in the first place, and the titleholder would just be left with civil remedies. An interpretation which allowed private citizens to effectively turn public reserve into private land defeated the legislation's objective. The fact that the titleholder was the province or a municipality and the use of the word public indicated the legislature wanted the government authority to decide what constituted a public facility. It cannot be public unless it was authorized or actually built by the government authority and was open for public use at all times. If the legislation was interpreted as Mr. Nanson suggested, then there were fewer violators. This made council's decision to prosecute only boathouses less unfair, and it did not give the defendants a defence as the boathouses were not open for public use. They constructed a private building on public reserve contrary to s. 197, therefore the boathouses were illegal under s. 221(1)(a)(ii) of the Act. The defendants were guilty unless prosecution was stayed as an abuse of process or because it violated s. 15 of the Charter. Council prosecuted defendants whom they saw as committing clear violations. To prosecute all violators initially would add expense at no benefit. A decision on boathouses was likely to lead to the desired clarification of the law. They had a complaint upon which they had a duty to act and wanted a test case to determine the legal position. Selective prosecution, per se, is not an abuse of process; rather it depends on the circumstances. The defendants must show they were singled out unfairly, not just that they were singled out. There was no such evidence. Stopping prosecutions for abuse of process is a power only to be used in the 'clearest of cases' (R. v. Keyowski). The defence must show that proceeding exceeds 'the limits of the community sense of fair play' and the administration of justice is best served by stopping the prosecution. In R. v. Rourke, the SCC said there was no general discretion to stay proceedings because they were considered 'oppressive'. In R. v. Jewitt, the SCC adopted the test from R. v. Young that 'there is a residual discretion in a trial judge to stay proceedings where compelling an accused to stand trial would violate those fundamental principles of justice which underlie the community's sense of fair play and decency, and to prevent the abuse of court's process through oppressive or vexatious proceedings'. Picking out defendants to prosecute from a pool of offenders to ascertain the legal position of the parties because one of their group has been the subject of a complaint did not violate 'the community sense of fair play and decency'. The defence relied on Regina v. Miles of Music Ltd. where the court said that 'no cause can fall within the category of the Ã¦clearest of cases' unless it can be fairly said that the cause of the apparent unfairness complained of can be Ã attributed to either the police or the Crown or both'. The defence said council not only did not prosecute, but did not investigate whether others were in violation. The court acknowledged this was so, but accepted the motivation was that council believed Mr. Nanson, and they did not currently intend to prosecute all violators. The defendant's real complaint was the decision to only prosecute boathouse owners. Council was trying to ascertain the law, so they could fulfill their duty to uphold it. The court found council proceeded against the defendants because it seemed sensible and financially responsible to do so, not because of any male fides. The municipal bylaws were not applicable to public reserves, but it made sense to seek the court's opinion on their applicability since council was going ahead with the action. The fact that one count was laid under the bylaws did not violate the community sense of fair play, but if it did, this would mean that count should be stayed. Council rightly attempted to get others to prosecute which caused a reasonable delay and did not prejudice the defendants. Any unsatisfactory delay was caused by the Department and not council. The Charter gives a right to a trial within a reasonable time, but this applies after a charge is laid. The delay by the province occurred pre-charge. There was no unreasonable post-charge delay or abuse of the legal process. Section 15 of the Charter is not limited to the enumerated types of discrimination, but it does not prohibit all discrimination. It must be commonly accepted discrimination abhorrent to the basic principles of society with no reason that justifies a breach of such principles. It was not discrimination contrary to s. 15 to select individuals to prosecute as a test case where it was not done for improper reasons.  'Equal protection and equal benefit of the law' did not mean one was entitled to have prosecution stopped until all violators were prosecuted. Picking out boathouse builders was not an example of discrimination prohibited by s. 15. The defence argued the law was not allowed to have unequal impact because of irrelevant circumstances (Law Society of British Columbia v. Andrews). This case should not be read so broadly. In the court's view, the proceedings should not be stayed because there was no violation of s. 15, and if the court was wrong, it was not 'appropriate and just' that such a remedy be granted, as required for relief under s. 24 of the Charter."
"The accused appealed the Summary Conviction Appeal Court decision ordering a new trial on seven counts against them under ss. 239(1)(a) and (d) of the Income Tax Act and (failing) to determine if the payments involved were income and in focussing only on the criminal intent of the accused. HELD: The appeal was allowed and the acquittals ordered by the trial judge were restored. 1) The appeal judge misinterpreted the decision. He proceeded on the worst case scenario, that is that all payments received by the appellants constituted income and then he considered the issue of criminal intent. Thus the trial judges properly considered the issues of income before dealing with mens rea. 2) The Crown argued the accounting records upon which the claim for deductions were made were, in fact, false, false thus obviating the liability for tax. The Crown did not raise this issue in its grounds of appeal to either SCC or this Court. 3) In Pursuant to R. v. Redpath Industries Ltd. et al. (1984), 84 D.T.C. 6349 (SK CA), the Court of Appeal is to determine whether the returns were false and therefore the basis for such findings was erroneous. The appeal court was not prepared to make such determinations. 4) The appellant's rights were not violated.","Both accused appealed the decision of the Summary Conviction Appeal Court Judge ordering a new trial on seven counts under s239(1)(a) and (d) of the Income Tax Act relating to evasion of payment of taxes and unlawfully making of a false or deceptive statement. The appeal judge decided the trial judge erred in failing to determine if the payments involved were income and in focusing only on the criminal intent of the accused. HELD: The appeal was allowed and the acquittals ordered by the trial judge were restored. There was no basis to overturn the findings of fact made by the trial judge. The appeal judge misinterpreted the decision of the trial judge who properly considered the issue of income before dealing with mens rea. The evidence of taxability was not clear-cut, obvious or indisputable."
"The issue on this appeal is the priority of security interest in a mobile home granted by the respondent to the respondent and subsequent purchaser for value, the Credit Union having regard to the operation of s. 28(1) and s. 30(2) of The Personal Property Security Act, 1993. The trial judge found that the respondent did not authorize the sale of the mobile home within the meaning of s28(1)(the P.P.S.A.) and the sale did not occur in the ordinary course of business as contemplated by s.30(2). The Credit Union appeals this decision. HELD: The issue is reduced to whether the respondent authorized the sale. It does not contemplate an authorization to a third party to deal with the collateral. The fundamental issue is whether the authorization is subject to the pre-condition of payment in full. The Court of Appeal relied heavily on Canadian Commercial Bank v. Tisdale Farm Equipment Ltd., a case that the trial judge clearly found that Lanson authorized the dealing. It follows that the security interest did not continue in the collateral and the title passed to the buyer, Spruce Meadow Trucking Ltd., free from the secured interest. It is not necessary for the appellant to find priorities as between the parties. There is a distinction between conditional authorization and an authorized sale subject to conditions that the proceeds be remitted to the secured party. In this case the respondent concluded that the Lanson didn't authorize the Sale of the Mobile Home (it was found that he knew that Nickel would either rent to sell the mobilehome, their only concern being that upon sale Nickel would repay the loan in full and that he would take free of any perfected or unperfected security interest. That is not the case here. Lanson clearly gave the secured creditor (the Credit Union) authorizing the sale and that dealing would include resale. The fact the debtor failed to pay a secured creditor does not invalidate the sale to the purchaser.","The issue on appeal was reduced to whether the security holder, Lanson, authorized Nickel to sell the mobile home as contemplated by s28(1) or, if not authorized, did he sell the mobile home in the ordinary course of business as contemplated by s30(2). Lanson loaned Nickel $16,000 to purchase a mobile home and registered their financing statement giving them a security interest in the mobile home. The trial judge found that Lanson knew that Nickel would either rent or sell the home but that upon a sale Nickel would repay the loan in full. Nickel sold the home but did not disclose the sale to Lanson. The purchaser, SP Trucking, did not require financing and did not search the Personal Property Registry. SP Trucking sold the home to Rempel who obtained financing from the Credit Union which registered a financing agreement claiming a security interest in the home and its proceeds. Lanson attempted to seize the home. The trial judge found Lanson's security interest continued and took priority over that of the Credit Union as Lanson had not authorized the sale to the trucking company and that Lanson had no interest in releasing the security interest until he received payment in full.  HELD: 1)Section 28(1) reiterates the common law principle of nemo dat quod non habet. The debtor's right to deal with collateral is subject to the security interest granted to the creditor unless certain things occur- ie. the secured party authorized expressly or by implication the dealing with the security. 2)The trial judge was in error in finding the secured party, Lanson, had to authorize the buyer, SP Trucking, to deal with the property and that the buyer must know of the authorization. Section 28(1) does not contemplate an authorization to a third party to deal with the collateral. The fundamental issue was whether the authorization was subject to the pre-condition of payment in full. 3)The authorization to sell must be given before the sale. Lanson clearly gave Nickel express authority to deal with the security which would include resale. The fact the debtor failed to pay the secured creditor did not invalidate the sale to the buyer.  4)Canadian Commercial Bank is restricted to cases where the secured party agrees with the buyer to release the security interest on the express condition that the obligation is satisfied in full and makes it clear to the debtor he does not intend to rely simply on the proceeds. There is a distinction between a conditional authorization and an authorized sale subject to conditions that the proceeds be remitted to the secured party. 5)The trial judge clearly found that Lanson authorized the dealing. It followed that the security interest did not continue in the collateral and the title passed to the buyer. The Credit Union acquired the collateral free of the security interest of Lanson and Lanson's rights against Nickle were restricted to the proceeds.  6)By declining to deal with the matter of s30(2), the appellate court was not to be taken as approving of the reasons of the trial judge. 7)The appellant was awarded costs on double Column V."
"This was an application for an order disallowing the limitation defence raised by Judgment Recovery on behalf of the defendant, Howard LeLacheur, pursuant to s. 10 of the Fatal Injuries Act. The plaintiffs were married 25 years ago and had two children. The deceased had been killed in a single car accident 25 years earlier. The plaintiff had made no inquiries to the defendant or any other family member, nor the police as to how this happened. She could have asked anyone else about the accident but for some reason did not do so. Her only inquiry was about the deceased's uncle. Dismissing the application, that the limitation period should not begin to run until February 1997, that being the date upon which she learned for the first time that Howard was or may have been the driver of the vehicle at the time of the fatality. This finding is not supported by the evidence.","The deceased was killed in a single car accident in 1972, leaving his wife, the plaintiff, who was pregnant with the second plaintiff, his daughter, as his survivors. In 1997, the plaintiffs first learned through other family members that the defendant, a nephew of the deceased, had revealed to them that it was actually he who was the driver of the car at the time of the accident. They brought an action under the provisions of the Fatal Injuries Act. This was an application to disallow the limitation defence raised by Judgment Recovery on behalf of the defendant. Dismissing the application without costs, that the limitation as prescribed by the Act is twelve months, which the plaintiffs had clearly exceeded. This time period is without regard to the injured party's knowledge of whether or not a claim exists."
"The appellant applied a wrong principle of law in refusing to strike out the appellant's statement of claim pursuant to a motion brought under Civil Procedure Rule 14.25. The broader issue involves consideration of the immunity of the Labour Relations Board and its members, from actions based on their alleged malice and bad faith. The appeal is allowed in part, per reasons for judgement of Pugsley, J.A. Hallett and Freeman, JJ.A., concurring. The issue is whether the Chambers judge applied a Wrong Principle of Law, as disclosing no reasonable cause of action, applies only in cases where the law is clear, and provided no further extrinsic evidence is required to resolve the issues. The appellants have not satisfied the Court that it is plain and obvious that the Statement of Claim discloses no reasonable motive of action. It is pertinent to note that this is not a matter of multifarious proceedings at least not to the extent of being frivolous and vexatious. All appear to the Court to be sincerely designed to seek redress of alleged wrongs.","The appellants motion to strike the respondent's statement of claim was dismissed on the ground that questions of law are not matters to be brought before the court on an application to strike. The Chambers judge also accepted the respondent's submission that the extent of the immunity of administrative boards and their members from actions such as this based on their alleged malice and bad faith is, as yet, unclear in Canada. Allowing the appeal in part, that the Chambers judge erred when he concluded that all questions of law, including questions where the law is clear, should not be brought before the court in an application to strike, when he concluded that the constitutional question posed by the respondent had not yet been answered by the courts, and when he determined that the extent of the immunity of the appellant Board and its members, except for the Chair, was unclear. The appeal was allowed with respect to the action against the Board and the individual members, apart from the Chair."
"FIAT. The applicant seeks an order nisi for sale of a 10 acre parcel of land bordering an ostrich farming business. The amount owing on the mortgage dates back to 1988. The Farm Credit Corporation as second mortgagee in the amount of $36,000 has been paid out. The respondents have not established that the land in the period prior to that met the definition of farm land. The Agricultural Credit Corporation in the style of cause has filed a writ of execution against the property. HELD: Apart from the length of the redemption period and the upset price that should be included in any order for sale, the issue is whether the land was a homestead within the meaning of the Act in August 1992. The homestead provisions of s. 44 of the Farm Security Act have no application in this case. The Court considered it reasonable to adjourn the application to June 7, 2001 at a time to be set by the local registrar. If this time does not allow the respondents to resolve the debt, by sale of the property or refinancing, then the respondents shall have the onus on the return date of providing evidence why the upsetprice suggested by the applicant should not be part of an order of sale.","FIAT.

HELD: The application was adjourned to June 7. 1)The homestead provisions of s.44 had no application in this case. The land was not being put to any farming use prior to August 1992 and the respondent's house at the time fell into the category of 'simply a dwelling in isolation' (Bank of Nova Scotia v.

"The Crown applied for DNA samples from the male, female and child pursuant to s. 487.05 of the Criminal Code for 3 D.N.A. Warrants. Each alleges that the middle-aged man and his 19-year old daughter have committed incest, contrary to s 155 of the Code and that child, now months old, has been born as result of the incestuous relationship. The applications for DNA as a condition of granting the warrants do not provide an indication as to how the DNA analysis will establish the adult male is the natural father of the 19- year old female and the baby and how it will negative any suggestion that the father and mother are'strangers' genetically speaking. DNA Warrants in Support. HELD: A DNA warrant application with respect to the baby would be premature, but may be renewed in due course if the Crown is so advised. There is nothing in s.485(1)(b) which can be said to suggest that a blood sample of a child born of an alleged incestuous relationships, which sample is not in the possession of the Crown and which remains in the child's child's body, is of assistance in providing a complete picture of the investigation and the court's findings of interest. There should be some indication as how theDNA analysis will determine whether the adult father is the biological father of this child and the child and how that will negative the any suggestion of the father/mother relationship between the parties. The contents of the three Informations in Support will not be disclosed or made public except pursuant to S.487.3 of the code.","The Crown applied for three DNA warrants pursuant to s.487.05 of the Criminal Code. Each of the three Informations sworn by an RCMP officer alleged the accused and his 19 year old daughter committed incest contrary to s.155, and a 7 month old child was born as a result. The Informations deposed that the Crown had obtained a DNA sample of the person who claimed to be the natural mother of the 19 year old.HELD: 1)No case was found dealing was a similar application regarding a possible charge under s.155. The words of s.487.05 were analyzed to determine its proper meaning and interpretation. 'Bodily substances' is not defined in the general definition s.2 nor the DNA definition s.487.04 of the Criminal Code. Assuming, without deciding, that it is proper to conclude that the child is a victim, there has been no bodily substance found or obtained from the child or from anyone else, and accordingly no portion of s.487.05(1)(b) is applicable. Subparagraphs 487.05(1)(b)(ii), (iii) and (iv) all refer to a bodily substance found or obtained on or within the body of a victim or some other person involved with the offence; 487.05(1)(b)(i) and (iv) refer to bodily substances found or obtained at or related to the place where the offence was committed. Nothing in s.487.05 suggests that a blood sample of a child born of an alleged incestuous relationship, which is not in the possession of the Crown and remains in the child, is a bodily substance found or obtained within the meaning of s.487.05(1)(a). 2)There were numerous deficiencies in the Informations. The paragraphs did not set out the basis or source of the officer's information, the relationship of the parties to the named informant, nor why the information was considered reliable. There should be some indication as to how the DNA analysis will establish that the adult male is the natural father and how it will negative any suggestion that the parents of the baby are 'strangers' genetically speaking. The qualifications of the RCMP officer who will take the blood samples and of the corporal who trained him should be set out. The paragraphing format was confusing. 3)A DNA warrant application would be premature. The custodial parent or parents are in the legal position of being the persons who can give informed consent to the taking of the baby's blood. It may be appropriate at some point to order a sample be obtained. It was questionable whether it was in the best interests of the administration of justice to make such an order now."
"The accused was charged with possession and use of a weapon for the purpose of trafficking contrary to s. 5(2) of the Controlled Drugs and Substances Act and possession and sale of marijuana in the presence of a person with a valid driving licence contrary to S. 267(a) of The Highway Traffic Safety Act and with the commission of a sexual offence contrary to ss. 249(1)(a) and C.P.I.A. The accused's s. 8, 9 and 10 Charter rights were infringed. All evidence obtained after the initial stop should be excluded pursuant to s24(2). HELD: The evidence was excluded. Even the s. 7 doctrine of the Charter was not applicable. The evidence did not establish any symptoms of impairment. The Court found that the presence or absence of marijuana during the initial search was not sufficient grounds to exclude it from its evidence. The strong odour of marijuana emanating from the interior of the vehicle gave the Court a reasonable suspicion that it was marijuana. The presence of any other evidence of impairment would not disqualify the accused from possessing or consuming marijuana.","The accused was charged with possession of marijuana for the purposes of trafficking contrary to s. 5(2) of the Controlled Drugs and Substances Act and four other charges related to her attempts to evade arrest. At the onset of her trial, the accused took the position that her s. 8, s. 9 and s. 10 Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms were infringed and that all the evidence obtained after the stop should be excluded. HELD: The accused's Charter rights were not breached. 1) The strong odour of raw cannabis marijuana emanating from the interior of the accused's vehicle in itself amounted to reasonable grounds not only for lawful detention but also for arrest. 2) The officer was not in breach of the accused's Charter rights by asking her where she had been and how long she had been there. 3) On the arrest or detention of the accused, she was promptly informed of the reasons therefore and she was informed of her right to retain and instruct counsel without delay."
"The applicant was not served with his application and supporting material for the hearing. The court had previously received from the applicant a sworn Affidavit of Service indicating that he had until the 23rd of April to contact the applicant. The applicant had also received a letter from the respondent stating that he was not informed of when the hearing was to take place. The respondent had then personally placed two telephone calls to the applicant's office and on two occasions left messages on the appellant's voice mail to return the call and at least two messages left on the petitioner's telephone mail to attempt to return a call. The appellant's affidavit was also struck. Allowing the appeal, that the applicant received adequate notice of the hearing and that he did not make himself available for the telephone conference and was not available for cross examination, his affidavit was struck and he was entitled to additional costs in the sum of $250 for a total of $550.","After the court released its decision but before an order was issued, the court received a letter from the respondent in which it was stated that he had not been served with the applicant's application and supporting material.

"Walgreens applied for an order pursuant to Queen's Bench Rules 664 and 673 quashing two orders of the Board made in May 2004 and June 2004. These orders require Wal-Mart Canada to discover and produce documents, including those referred to in a subpoena duces tecum. The Board has conceded that two exceptions to the general rule apply. The first is that it has no jurisdiction to issue subpoenas or make production orders without considering the relevance of what is sought to be produced. The second is that the Board has incorporated the evidence into its orders within the exception outlined by Lord Denning. HELD: A review of the transcript is essential to the proper determination of the issues raised by the application and that it must, in this case, be considered part of the record.  1) There are virtually no reasons given by the Board for why it ordered each and every document, memo or communication sought by UFCW other than to say that it is seeking documents in contravention of the previous rulings of the Saskatchewan courts that it was without jurisdiction to do so. 2) The Board acknowledged that the error of law must appear on the face of the Record and that the rule should not be relied upon to thwart meaningful judicial review in appropriate cases. It is not in dispute that the case law directs the court to adopt a pragmatic and functional analysis in determining the applicable standard of review. The Court will consider the issue of whether the question to be left to the exclusive jurisdiction of the tribunal, Pushpanathan v. Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration), 1998 CanLII 778 (SCC), [1998] S.C.R. 982. 3) It is beyond the scope of this judgment to review and comment on the relevancy requirement for documents. These portions would normally have been struck. However, the Board did not address these provisions in its decision. It declined to comment on them. 4) The application for discovery and document production is allowed in the first instance pursuant to s. 24 of Part I of the Constitution Act, 1982, declaring s. 9 of The Trade Union Act, R.S.S.; 1978, c. T-17, unconstitutional and of no force and effect insofar as it infringes the freedom of thought, belief, expression and communication under s. 2(b) of the Trade Union and s. 3(c) of Canada. 5) The portions of a transcript are attached as Schedule C to this judgment.","Wal-Mart Canada applies for an order pursuant to Rule 664 and Rule 673 of The Queen's Bench Rules of Court quashing the orders of the Board. The orders require Wal-Mart Canada to discover and produce documents. Wal-Mart Canada says that the Board does not have the jurisdiction to use the subpoena or make the disclosure and productions orders in the manner in which it has done. Wal-Mart Canada also applies for an order declaring s. 9 of The Trade Union Act unconstitutional. HELD: The orders of the Board are quashed with costs payable forthwith to Wal-Mart Canada by UFCW. The application for an order declaring s. 9 of The Trade Union Act to be unconstitutional and of no force and effect is dismissed without prejudice to Wal-Mart Canada to bring its application back. 1) The Court concluded that a review of the transcript was essential to the proper determination of the issues raised by the application and that it must be considered part of the record.  2) The case law has determined that orders made by the Board that in reality are document discovery orders, are orders made without jurisdiction to which the applicable standard of review is one of correctness. 3) The Board abused its jurisdiction and power to issue the subpoena duces tecum in two respects. First the Board issued the subpoena without any prior consideration as the relevance of the documents that it compelled Wal-Mart Canada to produce. The subpoena was issued before the hearings commenced. There is no evidence that the Board exercised its discretion judicially in considering the issue of relevancy. It is unlikely that the Board even scrutinized the subpoena or it would have likely required the scope of it to be narrowed. Second, the subpoena was far too generalized and amounts to an order to discover documents. The Board must restrict its consideration to evidence that is relevant to the issues before it. It is precluded from making its decision on the basis of irrelevant or improper considerations. 4) The Board exceeded its jurisdiction and abused its power in making the discovery and production orders it did. The comments of the Court with respect to the subpoena duces tecum apply in principle to the Board's discovery and production orders. The orders were not production orders but directed Wal-Mart to comply with the subpoena duces tecum.  5) The requirement that evidence, including documentary evidence, be relevant before it can be properly considered, is a substantive issue that goes to the heart of the legitimacy of judicial or quasi-judicial dispute determination. It is an important consideration in determining whether there has been a denial of natural justice where there has been reliance on improper considerations rather than relevant evidence. 6) Some of the documents sought are in the possession and control of a third party non-resident American corporation. Additional factors and procedures should at least have been considered such as the 'likely relevance' of the documents to an issue. Solicitor and client privilege was raised with respect to some of the documents yet the Board ordered the production of those documents without ruling on the issue or without providing a means by which the confidentiality of the documents could be maintained until a ruling was made. 7) The Board has demonstrated a reluctance to give up its perceived powers of discovery despite two previous decisions of the Court of Queen's Bench and the Court of Appeal. If it interprets this decision of the Court in the same fashion, an order to reconsider the issues would be of little value to the applicant. The only feasible option is to grant the relief that is sought by quashing the two orders.  8) Wal-Mart Canada submits that the Board has already interpreted s.9 of The Trade Union Act very broadly so that its effect violates s. 2(d) of the Charter. Wal-Mart Canada submits this is evidenced in two ways. First, by the manner in which the Board has permitted the proceedings to be conducted and second, by the focus of the hearing on the alleged anti-union philosophy of Wal-Mart Canada instead of on whether or not Wal-Mart Canada has in fact influenced its employees to bring their applications against UFCW. If the Board has interpreted s. 9 of The Trade Union Act in accordance with UFCW's submissions, then such an interpretation appears to be on a collision course with s.2(d) of the Charter of Rights. If s. 9 of the Act has the effect of restricting freedom of expression between an employee and an employer that does not constitute interference or coercion, then s. 9 may well violate s. 2(d) of the Charter and if not saved by s. 1 of the Charter, is unconstitutional. However, Wal-Mart Canada's application respecting the constitutionality of s. 9 of the Act is premature in the sense that the Court did not have a sufficient factual foundation or context to properly measure s. 9 of the Act against s. 2(d) of the Charter."
"The appellant appealed his conviction for driving a motor vehicle while suspended, contending the adjudicator's findings were so flawed that he did not properly interpret the provisions of the Motor Vehicle Act, and did not offer a reasonable doubt as to whether the appellant was the driver. Allowing the appeal, that the conviction was unreasonable and cannot be supported by the evidence, and that there was insufficient evidence to prove that the appellant's son was in the vehicle. The adjudicator also failed to address the issue of whether the Crown's witness, the RCMP officer, was reasonably capable of being evidence to the contrary so as to raise reasonable doubt. The Crown appealed. Appeal allowed; conviction of the appellant on the grounds the adjudicating judge did not address the issues of credibility; the Crown had established a prima facie case, having proved all the elements of the offence necessary for conviction, and on the basis of the acceptable evidence heard, the Court was satisfied beyond reasonable doubt of the accused in this matter.","The appellant was convicted of driving a motor vehicle while his licence was suspended. The appeal centred upon the adjudicator's acceptance of the police officer's evidence and the reliability of that evidence versus the defence witnesses who testified that the appellant's son was actually the driver of the vehicle. Appeal allowed; verdict of acquittal entered. The adjudicator erred by failing to address whether the appellant's evidence raised a reasonable doubt as to his innocence, particularly on the central issue of whether the appellant was the only person present in the vehicle. But not making a finding on this critical issue, this tended to suggest more strongly that the adjudicator engaged in an either/or analysis in accepting the evidence of the Crown's witnesses over that of the four defence witnesses; the adjudicator should have made clear findings of credibility based on the evidence before him."
"The parties to this action signed handwritten agreement on the 20th day of October 2004. The entire document reads as follows: Contract between the parties: 1) The plaintiff is to provide labor and equipment necessary to feed and maintain the cows for a set price of $0.50 per day. 2) The defendant claims that the eight year term bonus was not enforceable except for the fact that it was an essential element of the agreement. The parties did not reach an essential agreement for which they were both entitled to pay. 3) The agreement to come to an agreement is still not enforced. The plaintiff claims that he was not entitled to the essential sum of $7,900 as he did not have a copy of the final invoice given to him. The defendant shall issue the balance to the plaintiff.","The parties entered into a handwritten agreement with regard to the feeding and maintenance of 100 cows. The plaintiff was to provide labour and the necessary equipment to feed and maintain the cows for $.50 per cow per day. The defendant was to provide the feed and medicine. At paragraph 6 the contract stipulated that the plaintiff was to receive a bonus for each live calf that he got to pasture. The amount of the bonus was left blank. The plaintiff sues the defendant, claiming a bonus for the 2004-2005 year and the 2005-2006 year. HELD: The claim is dismissed. In law an agreement to come to an agreement is not enforceable. This is especially true where an essential term regarding remuneration has not been agreed to. The parties agreed that they would settle on the bonus amount later on but they never did. The plaintiff believes he is still entitled to a bonus. The Court cannot make the agreement for the parties."
"The registered owner of the property appeals the respondent's demolition order. The respondent seeks a new appeal under s. 329(4) of The Cities Act. The issues on appeal are whether the quasi-judicial board erred by not confirming the November 2004 demolition order but by allowing the respondent to bring forward a written proposal to the board committing to the operation of the building under a qualified professional property management firm with proven record and acting at arm’s length to the applicant. The board reviewed the history of non-compliance, the intolerable sub-standard living conditions endured by the tenants, and the absence of a pro-active approach by the applicant to responsibly manage the safety and security of the tenants and visitors. HELD: The appeal is dismissed on all grounds. The Board found that the Building and Fire Inspector at the time of issuing the demolition order properly determined there to be a nuisance relating to the use and activities surrounding the building, which adversely affected the amenities of the neighbourhood including the safety, health and welfare of the people both resident and non-resident. It is too late to raise such an allegation now. There is no denial of natural justice with respect to the allegation that the board was biased against the less fortunate. It would be appropriate to have the respondent bring forward his written proposal, which must be supported by a detailed plan prepared by the professional property-management firm for the operation and management of the buildings. In the event the Board approves a sale to an arms length third party, the order will become immediately enforceable.","The appellant appeals a demolition order pursuant to s. 329(4) of The Cities Act issued against his property. Issues on appeal was whether the board erred by considering material which had not been before city council, whether the board committed a jurisdictional error by failing to disclose evidence to the appellant prior to considering the appeal, and whether the board was biased against the appellant. HELD: The appeal is dismissed on all grounds. The board's order is confirmed. Counsel for the City advised that it would be appropriate to extend the suspension of enforcement of the demolition order to a period of 6 months from the date of this court order. The applicant is granted a 6 month period to remedy the problems identified. 1) The board complied with the directions of the Saskatchewan Court of Appeal to ensure all disclosure had been made to the appellant of relevant evidence that would be considered by the board. The board has ensured that the appellant knew the case he had to meet. No error of law has been committed. 2) The appellant had all the information considered by the board disclosed to him. 3) There is no evidence of bias. Oppositely, the evidence supports the board's conclusion that the situation in the building constituted a nuisance related to the activities around the building, including the safety of the residents and surrounding neighbours. There is no evidence of bias against the appellant personally."
"The applicant appealed the chambers judge's decision dismissing his application under Rule 173(e) of the Queen's Bench Rules of Court and the inherent jurisdiction of the Court to strike out or stay the application of the Director of Community Operations for a community safety order under The Safer Communities and Neighbourhoods Act because the Director's application constituted a multiplicity of proceedings and was therefore an abuse of process. The applicant sought to strike the order on the basis that it was an interlocutory appeal from a decision which is part of an application under SCAN. The Chambers judge dismissed the application, but the applicant appealed. Appeal dismissed; the Court of Appeal has the jurisdiction to hear this appeal pursuant to Rule 173 of the Rules of court and the Court has the right to stay the order in the circumstances of this case. The Director's grounds of appeal are framed in the manner of a procedural order under Queen's B Bench Rule 173 and/or the inherent authority of the court to hear the appeal based on the principles of estoppel and collateral attack. The jurisdiction to decide the appeal of this appeal can be found in the Court's general jurisdiction under ss. 24(e), 25(1)(a) and (2)(b) of The Court of Appeals Act, 2000 and on the same issues as the one dealt with in Danyluk v. Morguard (2000). HELD: Appeal dismissed. The Court will not deal with this appeal on the rubric of whether the Chambers judge erred in finding there was no abuse of processes. The application is an inter-locutory one and therefore an Abuse of process complaint. The court will not intervene to prevent the application in this fashion. The stay is not an abuse in process.","HELD: The Court addressed the issue of jurisdiction by holding that it would follow its usual practice to refuse to hear an entirely new matter argued for the first time on appeal. Since the order being appealed from was not a Part II order under SCNA, what was being appealed was a procedural order under Queen’s Bench Rule 173 and the inherent jurisdiction of the Court, and therefore the Court had jurisdiction to hear the appeal pursuant to ss. 7 and 8 of the Court of Appeal Act. The Court held with respect to the decision in Chambers that the judge properly exercised her discretion and did not err in refusing to grant the stay requested. The Chambers judge appropriately balanced the factors respecting the fairness of allowing re-litigation and determined in all of the circumstances that it would not be unfair to the appellant to allow the SCNA application to succeed because the purpose of that legislation was different and had a wider ambit of The Residential Tenancies Act. However, the result of this appeal could not be taken to have decided whether a public officer’s actions pursuant to a statutory power could be an abuse of process or that an application under The Residential Tenancies Act to terminate a tenancy by the director and subsequent SCNA application respecting the same residence may never be questioned in any circumstances."
"The accused, accused, is charged with sexual assault of the complainant contrary to s. 271 of the Criminal Code. The charge arises from sexual activity that occurred between the accused and the complainant in December 2012. The complainant has no memory of the sexual activity due to an alcohol induced blackout. The Crown argues that there was no consent. The accused does not deny that he had sex with the complainant. He claims that the activity was consensual or, alternatively, that he has an honest but mistaken belief in consent. HELD: The accused is not guilty. The Court heard contradictory evidence with respect to the central issue of consent, an assessment of credibility, which is to be assessed in light of all the evidence. It is open to the accused to claim that the complainant's words and actions, before and during the incident, raise a reasonable doubt against her assertion that she, in her mind, did not want the sexual touching to take place. If the complainant did not consent, did the accused have an honest and mistaken belief that consent? The accused's conduct raises reasonable doubt about her non-consent and that she was capable of consent.","There was contradictory evidence regarding the central issue of consent and therefore the court had to assess credibility. The complainant’s action of fleeing the situation was found to be consistent with both not consenting and with regret, humiliation and embarrassment. The evidence of the accused’s witnesses was found to raise a reasonable doubt about the complainant’s non-consent. The court concluded that the complainant was not as intoxicated as she said; for example, she had a conversation with the accused’s sister. Therefore, the court was also not satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt that the complainant was incapable of consenting due to her level of intoxication. It was unnecessary for the court to consider whether the accused had an honest but mistaken belief in consent. The accused was found not guilty."
"The accused was charged with impaired driving contrary to s. 255(1) and s. 253(1)(a) of the Criminal Code and with breach of s. 8 of the Charter by failing to provide a sample of her breath to enable analysis to be made by means of an approved screening device. HELD: The accused was found not guilty on all of the counts. The Court of Appeal upheld the trial judge’s conclusions that the police officer was attending to conduct a search for evidence following Evans, 1996 CanLII 248. The police officer exceeded the authority conferred by the implied licence to knock. The court found that the officer did not knock on the door for the purpose of securing evidence for a crime, but rather because she was concerned that perhaps this person was out driving around with a young child in the backseat. The officer”s accompanying her around the house and the actions outside of the home in full public view in a residential neighbourhood are serious. The accused” s.8 Charter breach” was serious. It was found that as long as the evidence of impairment established beyond reasonable doubt, any degree of impairment ranging from slight to great the offence was made out. There was no evidence of driving at all and the officer had no lawful authority to conduct search at the entrance to the house nor to enter the house without permission. Therefore the accused was not found guilty. The voir dire was voided.","HELD: The Charter application was granted. The accused was found not guilty. The court found that the accused’s s. 8 Charter rights had been breached. After applying the Grant analysis, the court decided that the breach was serious and that the unreasonable search affected the accused’s privacy, liberty and dignity because the accused did not invite the officer into her house, she was followed by the officer throughout her home and then handcuffed outside her home in full public view. The court concluded that society’s interests to be free from police interference in their own home without proper judicial authorization supported the exclusion of the evidence. Regarding the impaired driving charge, the accused was found not guilty because of insufficient evidence."
"FIAT: The wife applies for interim spousal support and an order providing her with an interim distribution of property in the amount of $25,000. HELD: 1) The court has authority to order an interim dividend pursuant to s. 26(2) of The Family Property Act, SS 1997. In this instance there is some dispute between the parties as to whether they have any beneficial interest in the house they were residing in at the date of separation (which appears to be legally owned by a third party). They concede that this issue cannot be resolved on an interim motion. 2) At an interim stage it is often quoted that the paramount consideration at an early stage of the breakdown is “need and ability to pay”. However, this is not a situation where the net assets far exceed the amount requested. In addition, ultimately the distribution may have to be by way of spousa rollover from the locked-in retirement funds as there appear to be no liquid assets available to the husband. The wife’s application for an interim payment of the property is dismissed.  3) There is no order as to costs.","HELD: The application for interim spousal support was granted and the respondent ordered to pay $500 per month. The order was made to diminish the disparity between the income and lifestyles of the parties. The application for interim distribution of property was dismissed. The court found that this was not a situation where the net assets exceeded the amount of the distribution claimed. As the respondent had no liquid assets, the distribution of family property might eventually involve a spousal rollover from the pension funds to the petitioner."
"This was an application for an order setting aside the default judgment and writ of execution issued against the applicants pursuant to Queen's Bench Rule 346 and for an ORDER setting aside allgarnishee summonses issued pursuant to Rule 441 and s. 10 of The Attachment of Debts Act. The applicants had filed an application to set aside the garnishee sues pursuant to s. 3(2) of the Attachment Of Debts act and for a order setting off allgardenishee subpoenas pursuant to rule 441and s. 9 of The Defences of Debt Act. HELD: The application toset aside the defaults judgment and the writ of execute was dismissed. 1)The applicants had clearly shown that they had a good defence on the merits to the garnish demand. 2)The application for payment out of any money paid into court by the garniselhee suis is premature and is dismissed without prejudice to re-apply. 3)The Court will exercise its discretion to set up judgment regularly signed. 4)The garnishees sues shall be set aside pursuant to S. 14(2 of the ATTachment of debts Act for payment of all of the monies paid into Court pursuant to the sues garnisheed. 5)The Application for payment in the amount of $7,192.49 is dismissed. 6)The applications for payment for payment are premature. The application for the payment out is dismissed with prejudice to the re-application.","1)Application by plaintiffs (defendants by counterclaim) for an order setting aside the default judgment, writ of execution and 2)garnishee summonses issued against them. 3)Application by respondents (plaintiffs by counterclaim) for payment out of the monies garnisheed. HELD: 1)Application allowed. At the time that the applicants were served with the statement of defence and counterclaim, they were not represented by counsel nor did they know that they had to serve and file a statement of defence to the counterclaim. However, immediately upon being served with the garnishee summons they contacted solicitors. The application to set aside the default judgment was made as soon as possible after the judgment came to the attention of the applicants who have explained to the satisfaction of the court their failure to defend the counterclaim. The applicants have clearly shown that they have a good defence on the merits to the counterclaim. The applicants did not delay their application to set aside the judgment so that it cannot be argued that delay will cause irreparable injury to the respondents. 2)Application to set aside guarishee summons dismissed. There has been strict compliance with s.3(2) of the Act. The affidavits filed by the applicants challenging the affidavit for garnishee summons have no bearing on whether the garnishee summons should be set aside. It is not the function of a judge to look into the merits of the case on such an application. 3)Application for payment out of monies garnisheed dismissed. Section 14(1) of The Attachment of Debts Act provides that no order shall be made for payment out of any money paid into court by the garnishee when a garnishee summons issues prior to judgment until the plaintiff has recovered a judgment against the defendant. Since the judgment has been set aside the application for payment out is premature and is therefore dismissed without prejudice to reapply."
"FIAT. An application for judicial review of an arbitration award by a three-person panel dated December 1, 1994 which reinstated the respondent as an employee as well as a letter of understanding between the applicant and the union that employees would notify the company if they were to be absent from work due to illness or other reason. The respondent took the position that the Mutual Agreement was a last chance agreement. Based on this agreement and the evidence presented at the hearing, the Arbitration Board was obliged to uphold the termination. The penalty imposed was a suspension without pay for 16 months. HELD: The application was dismissed with costs. 1)The patently unreasonable test is absent jurisdictional or procedural fairness issues. 2)The Board's interpretation of the mutual agreement with respect to clause 10 was correct. 3)The penalty imposed on the respondent was not discharge.","FIAT An employer sought judicial review of a unanimous decision by an arbitration board ordering the reinstatement of an employee. The employee had previously been terminated and then reinstated by the mutual agreement of the union and the employer. The employee was then terminated a second time for a repeat infraction. The employer took the position that the agreement was a 'last chance' agreement and that the arbitration board was therefore required to uphold the second termination. The Board ruled that the agreement was not a 'last chance' agreement because the agreement stated on its face that a further infraction would result in 'discipline up to and including dismissal'. The Board therefore reinstated the employee but imposed a 16 month suspension, without pay. HELD: 1)On issues involving the interpretation of a collective agreement, an arbitration board's decision can only be overturned if it is patently unreasonable. If there is any evidence on the basis of which the board could have found as it did then its decision should not be interfered with, even if the Court would have come to a different conclusion on the same evidence. 2)Decisions involving the interpretation of a statute or the common law, however, are not within an arbitrator's core area of expertise and should therefore be reviewed with reference to the standard of correctness. 3)In this case, the 'mutual agreement' was subsidiary to the collective agreement and its interpretation was therefore within the core area of the arbitrators' expertise. The standard to be applied to the board's interpretation of the mutual agreement was therefore one of patent unreasonableness. 4)The employer's evidence that it had verbally advised the employee that he would be fired for any repeat infraction was rightly rejected as contravening the parol evidence rule. The board's interpretation of the mutual agreement was therefore not patently unreasonable and in fact was correct. 5)The board was also entitled to reject the employer's argument based upon the doctrine of 'culminating incident' and it did not act unreasonably in so doing."
"The 46-year-old female plaintiff sought judgment for damages she suffered as a result of the defendant's negligent operation of the motor vehicle owned by the plaintiff. All of the elements of the plaintiff's claim had been resolved with the exception as to whether the plaintiff suffered from injuries caused by the defendants negligence. HELD: The Court answered the question as to the causation of the plaintiffs injuries.  1)Did the collision cause or contribute to any ofthe plaintiff's injuries or damage? 2)Had the defendant been a medical doctor, he would have been qualified to diagnose injuries. The Court would have found the defendant to be a qualified expert in the field of biomechanics. 3)The Court was not prepared to accept the defendants' expert opinion as to cause or mitigate the damage.","The Plaintiff commenced these proceedings seeking to recover damages for personal injuries alleged to have been suffered in a motor vehicle accident. The Defendants claimed that the Plaintiff's condition related to 2 pre-existing injuries. The only issue which the Court was asked to resolve was whether this accident had caused or contributed to the Plaintiff's injuries. HELD: The question posed was answered in the affirmative. While a normal healthy person might not have been injured in this low speed rear-end collision, the Court was satisfied that, because of the Plaintiff's previous injuries and poor sitting position, the collision did contribute to her current condition in a modest manner."
"Whether money owed under a guaranteed investment certificate (GIC) is debt 'accruing due' under s. 5(1) of the Attachment of Debts Act or subject to garnishment cannot be determined by reference only to garnishability of promissory notes not yet due. This is because the debt at the time fixed for payment is conditional upon the vendors being able to make title, and where he has no title the purchase-money never becomes payable. This argument mixes two different streams of the law of garnishment: the law pertaining to 'conditional debts' and the law dealing with the garnishment of notes. HELD: Appeal allowed. 1)The first type of debt not held to be subject to condition and held to to be garnishable is that arising between a financial institution and a debtor. 2)Garnishment is not the only branch of the legal system which can be rationalized. 3)The conditional nature of the debt such as that of a GIC is not a separate category from the others. A garnishment summons is not sufficient to prevent garnishment. 4)Graftishment is a conditional debt which must be paid to the debtor within 30 days of its maturity. 5)Gust garnishment is prevented because of a conditional one and made so by reason of assignment.","The issue was whether $10,000 payable under a GIC was subject to garnishee as a debt due or accruing due within the meaning of s5(1) of the Attachment of Debts Act. The Bank had served a garnishee summons on First Line seeking to attach money owing to David. First Line paid nothing because the debt was not payable until its maturity. When the debtor died First Line paid the money to his estate. Relying on Tradewinds, the chambers judge dismissed the Bank's application. The appeal turned on whether the debt was accruing due or whether it was a conditional debt because it could be assigned. HELD: The appeal was allowed. The GIC was attachable pursuant to s5(1) of the Attachment of Debts Act.  1)The main point was whether the debt was not attachable because it was not accruing due when the garnishee summons was served in that it did not bind the debt. 2)The leading authority, Webb v. Stenton, concluded that existing debts payable in the future are attachable. 3)The garnishability of the debt owing under a promissory note is not prevented because the debt is conditional by reason of the possibility of assignment.  4)Saskatchewan courts have followed Bel-Fran holding that a term deposit is attachable. The only exception is Tradewinds which overlooked the aspect of s5(1) which permits attaching of debts which are accruing due. Tradewinds is contrary to Spiritwood and misapplies the law summarized in Barsi v. Farcas. The historic review demonstrated that there have been gradual changes in the law of garnishment. Based on the cases reviewed the assignability of a GIC is not the type of condition which has been held to affect the determination that a debt is accruing due. 5)Because of the early payment to the estate there were no intervening claims and no priority issue arose. It would be inappropriate to deny judgment in the circumstances. DISSENT: The appeal would be dismissed for reasons other than those reached by the chambers judge. 1)The statement that the creditor cannot be in a better position than the debtor to demand payment under the GIC is probably correct but was not a factor as the Bank was not seeking payment before its maturity date. The Bank's position was the debt had been garnisheed and payment should have been made to the Bank on maturity. 2)The chamber judge's comment that the Bank could have seized the GIC under execution and then had it sold by the sheriff was obiter. 3)The debt was a present debt due on its maturity date and therefore qualified as one that was accruing due. 4)Whether it was conditional depended upon whether the opportunity of assignment constitutes a conditional obligation. There is no significant difference between a promissory note and a GIC as they both contain a promise to pay a sum certain at a designated date. 5)Some jurisdictions specifically provide that a debt payable within six years of the service of the garnishee is garnishable."
"The sales agent for Allstate was terminated as a result of a two-year, non-competition clause in his employment contract which provided for monthly compensation based on the net written premium on new policies written during the previous month together with renewal compensation calculated by reference to the net premium on renewal policies recorded in the terminated employee's account during the two production quarters preceding that particular month. Allstate sought to justify the termination on the basis of cause, but alleged that this did not constitute a failure by the employee to mitigate his damages. Awarding 20 months salary, as damages in the amount of $1,800 to $3,000 per month, that the employee did not pursue the possibility of alternative employment with enthusiasm or commitment and, as a consequence, had not been compensated during his period of employment with the defendant. The defendant rejected the argument that there was no month for which the plaintiff had not received pro-rated amount to November 5, 1991, when Allstate informed the plaintiff's employment contract with Allstate that no further conversions to the Neighbourhood Office Program status or the new compensation contract would be available to agents on staff prior to the introduction of these programs. Rather, the termination of the contract had no effect on the employee's efforts to seek alternative employment.","The plaintiff was terminated as a sales agent after being employed by the defendant for 26 years. As part of the termination package he received 14 months salary continuation. The plaintiff claimed that he had not received 'reasonable notice' and sought damages. He also claimed that he was owed arrears of salary at the time of his dismissal. The defendant argued that the plaintiff had failed to mitigate his damages. Dismissing the action, that the appropriate period of notice was in the range of 14 to 15 months. Since the calculation of a 'reasonable period of notice' is not an exact exercise, either period could have been justified. Thus, it could not be said that the 14 month period given by the defendant was unreasonable. Furthermore, the plaintiff was not owed any arrears. Finally, in view of a non-competition clause in the contract of employment, it was not unreasonable for the plaintiff not to have pursued employment with other insurance companies any more than he had."
"FIAT. The plaintiffs sought an order preserving and detaining certain proceeds from certain oil production properties, those proceeds now being held by an escrow agent pursuant to an order of the bankruptcy court in Alberta and a further order preservingand detaining all future proceeds from those properties. HELD: 1)A mandatory injunction can only be granted where the plaintiff shows a very strong probability upon the facts that grave damage will accrue to him in the future. This test goes much further than the 'prima facie', or strong prima facie, case that must be proven in a negative injunction application. 2)The applicants failed to meet the first and second tests. 3)Saskatchewan courts must be careful to see that the defendant knows exactly what he has to do and this means not as a matter of law but as matter of fact. 4)If the court decides that it is proper case to grant a mandatory injunction it must be cautious to see if the plaintiffs have established a'very strong probability' of irreparable harm. If not, the applicants would be required, under Queen's Bench Rule 390, to pay full compensation before the order was issued.","FIAT. The plaintiffs sought an order preserving and detaining certain proceeds from oil production properties which were being held by an escrow agent pursuant to an order of the bankruptcy court in Alberta and a further order preserving and detaining all future proceeds from those properties. The applicants claimed such orders were necessary to protect their claims under the approximately 408 builders' liens filed against those oil properties. The contents of the statements of claim in each of the five actions were identical. HELD: The application was dismissed. The escrow agent was ordered to remit to Herc the lien property revenues with any interest earned less the agent's appropriate costs. With the exception of SEM the parties appearing through counsel were awarded their costs against the applicants. 1)The tests set out in Bean on Injunctions for granting a mandatory injunction were summarized in Cupar School Division. The tests really state in different forms the generally recognized test for prima facie case, irreparable harm and balance of convenience but with more stringent requirements. 2)Only one lien holder filed an affidavit, no invoices or other information were filed substantiating the amount claimed in any of the liens. The word 'or' used in one of the liens indicated that the person subject to the lien did not know whether the water or oil was transported. Whatever prima facie case the lien holders might have was weakened. 3)The applicants had not established a very strong probability that grave danger will accrue. The risk to the respondents if the order should be granted was far greater than the risk to the applicants if the order were not granted. The oil properties would continue to decline without further development or recovery efforts to maintain or increase production. If a preservation order issued SEM would likely exercise its extensive powers under the Oil and Gas Conservation Act. 4)While s33 of the Builders' Lien Act provides for a lien on the holdback of any trust funds held by the contractor, it does not give the lienholder a charge against any other moneys. A builder's lien cannot be looked on as 'proof' that the amount claimed is what is actually owing. The only remedy open to the lienholder is to enforce its claim under Part VIII of the Builders' Lien Act. The statement of claim said nothing about dates and times. On the material filed it was impossible to know whether any of the respondents were intervening parties within s49(5)(a). 5)The second and third tests were not met. The order would guarantee irreparable harm by freezing the capital necessary to hinder the decline in value. It would be unacceptable to SEM that lien holders should receive the income from the properties without being responsible for the environmental costs. 6)The fourth test required that the defendant know exactly what he has to do. If the order were to issue it would be difficult to determine the proper amount of lien property revenue that should be paid to an escrow agent. There was no definition of net revenues in the Plan. The applicants would have been required pursuant to Rule 390 to pay full compensation before the order was issued."
"A claim for damages to the plaintiff's leased motor vehicle arising out of an automobile accident. The plaintiff claimed damages for the damage to the vehicle and sought reimbursement of the $503.73 deducted for depreciation. The insurer argued that SGI elected to repair or replace the vehicle's exhaust system under statutory condition 8(4) of s. 39 of The Automobile Accident Insurance Act. HELD: The claim was dismissed. 1)An express election is not necessary. If the plaintiff wishes to reinstate, he must give the assured unequivocal notice that he intends to exercise his option. 2)The claim was not made within the time limit set out in the Act. The fact that the insurance company took no notice of the alternative claim for reinstatement and did not send out a roving appraiser to determine the damage did not constitute an election. 3)SGI was not responsible for the entire repair. 4)The conduct of the insurer in this case was not an election according to the definition provided in the legislation. Rather, it was an election by conduct. The express election was not necessary as the damage was not ascertained by the appraiser but by the insurer's control over the repairs and repairers. 5)If the plaintiff wished to take advantage of the reinstatement but was denied the right of action under the terms of the policy, he had to pay the full cost without any contribution from the insured.","A claim for damages to the plaintiff's leased automobile arising out an accident. The action against the defendant Ruhr had been discontinued. An SGI adjuster appraised the damage but during the course of repairing the vehicle further damage was found. A roving adjuster authorized the replacement of the exhaust system but deducted 20% for depreciation. The plaintiff brought an action for reimbursement of the $503.73 arguing that SGI elected to repair or replace the exhaust system under statutory condition 8(4) of s39 of the Automobile Accident Insurance Act. SGI took the position that as Crestview was the registered owner of the vehicle the plaintiff was not entitled to bring this action as he was not the insured within the meaning of the Act. SGI also argued that Crestview authorized the repairs and acknowledged the 20% deduction as registered owner and that if the plaintiff paid the $503.73 he did so under his private lease contract with Crestview. It also argued that it is entitled to deduct for depreciation in any event. HELD: The claim against SGI was dismissed with taxed costs.  1)An election under statutory condition 8(4) amounts to an irrevocable decision to repair regardless of costs of repairs. Once an election is made the insurer is bound to pay or reinstate. An insurer by its conduct may be deemed to make an election to reinstate. The insurer's election to reinstate unilaterally creates a new contract which the insurer may not unilaterally revoke. On the facts the insurer neither expressly nor by its conduct elected to reinstate. The roving appraiser provided an appraisal to Crestview which included the depreciation deduction. Crestview repaired the vehicle without advising the plaintiff. 2)The concept of waiver in insurance law encompasses an election to pay or to reinstate. Estoppel was not applicable. Two provisions of the Saskatchewan Act provide that SGI in certain situations is not deemed to have waived provisions of the Act. The roving appraiser reassessed the claim and included the newly found damages. These acts related to the appraisal of the claim and could not constitute a waiver of statutory condition 8(1). They did not constitute an election under statutory condition 8(4). Crestview, not SGI, took the steps to repair the vehicle. As the plaintiff did not receive a written waiver of statutory condition 8(1) pursuant to s77 the insurer could not be deemed to have waived its option to enforce statutory condition 8(1).  3)The exhaust system was three years old and had 46,000 km of wear. A 20% deduction for depreciation was appropriate and therefore allowed.  4)It was not necessary to determine whether the plaintiff was the 'insured' as defined by the Act."
"FIAT The plaintiffs applied for an order pursuant to Queen's Bench Rule 173 striking out the statements of defence and counter-claim of Jeffrey and Karen Rilkoff and the separate statement of defence of Helen. The plaintiffs claim their damages arose in 1994 and that the cause thereof was a different cause than those dealt with in the 1989 and 1992 judgments. The defendants have referred to judgment of this Court in support of their allegation that if the resolutions authorizing the assessments do not also contain resolutions authorized the plaintiffs to recover interest and solicitor/client costs, the plaintiffs are not entitled to do so. They also referred to a judgment of the Court which referred to the doctrine of res judicata, or issue estoppel, which precludes the pursuing of such issues. HELD: The application of the plaintiffs was bedismissed with costs to the defendants in any event of the cause. 1)The issues raised do not appear susceptible of being resolved on a summary basis and certainly not on a summary basis. 2)The Court was not permitted to embark upon the resolution of legal questions in order to determine whether the pleadings should be struck as requested.","FIAT. The plaintiffs applied for an order striking out the statement of defence and counterclaim and separate statement of Helen Rilkoff as not disclosing a reasonable defence or cause of action. The plaintiffs claimed the doctrine of res judicata applied to the claim for damages by virtue of two Small Claims court judgments in 1989 and 1992. The defendants asserted their damages arose in 1994 and that the cause thereof was different than those previously dealt with. HELD: The application was dismissed with costs to the defendants in any event of the cause. 1)The fact that the plaintiffs filed a 55 page brief in support of their submissions and the defendants filed a 14 page brief in response evidenced that the issues were not easily resolved and certainly not on a summary basis.  2)An application to strike out pleadings basically permits only an examination of the impugned pleadings to determine if any justifiable dispute is revealed. If no facts are in dispute, the parties may resort to Rule 188. Only if the defendants consented to the application being converted into an application pursuant to Queen's Bench Rule 188 could the court proceed to resolve the questions of law."
"The plaintiff gave birth to a healthy baby girl on August 25, 1992. She was admitted to the Victoria Union Hospital by ambulance as a result of the sudden onset of profuse vaginalbleeding. The defendant performed a caesarian section to contain the bleeding and stabilized the plaintiff. The plaintiff alleged that the hysterectomy was negligent in the performance of his professional duties and services upon her with the result that the hemorrhage became inevitable. Central to the plaintiff's allegations of negligence on the part of the defendant was that the likely cause of the ongoing or recurring bleeding was the retained products of conception which the surgeon failed to remove from her uterus by a dilation and curettage procedure.HELD: The plaintiff was awarded judgment for irretrievable loss and for the pain and suffering resulting from her treatment and surgery.  1)The Court found that the surgical procedures performed on the plaintiff were realistic and reasonable in that they prevented the bleeding which in turn would have obviated the necessity of performing the hysticomy. 2)The surgical procedures were straightforward and methodical. The only thing that could be expected of a surgical procedure was a detailed description of the procedures performed.","A month following the birth of the plaintiff's only child by caesarian section, she underwent a hysterectomy on an emergency basis. She believed that the post-partum haemorrhage was caused by retained products of conception and that failure to perform a dilation and curettage procedure resulted in the hysterectomy. HELD: The plaintiff's claim was dismissed with costs. 1)The plaintiff failed to prove that the defendant was negligent in his treatment of her. The doctor's treatment and care met the standard of care expected of the average physician and surgeon, specializing in gynaecology and obstetrics. 2)She failed to prove that the cause of the post-partum haemorrhage was retained products of conception or that his failure to perform a D&amp;C resulted in the necessity of a hysterectomy or because of any other negligent act or omission on his part. The most likely hypothesis was that the post-partum hemorrhage was caused in this case by the necrosis of the cervix. Given the rarity of this condition and paucity of documented medical knowledge the defendant doctor could not be faulted. The evidence did not support the suggestion that a D&amp;C would have cured the hemorrhage. ADDENDUM: 1)The first paragraph was deleted and a new paragraph substituted: Kaban v. Sett in applying Ares v. Venner rejected the view that nurse's notes are only prima facie evidence and, if there is sworn testimony contrary to the notes, the notes cease to be prima facie evidence. 2)A paragraph was added after the quote on page 4: The Manitoba Court of Appeal, in dismissing the plaintiff's appeal, agreed with the trial judge's determination of the admissibility of the nurse's notes."
"The primary issue on this appeal was whether the youth court has jurisdiction in proceedings which are commenced in youth court where it is alleged that the offences occurred when the accused was either a young person or an adult. HELD: The decision of the summary conviction appeal court judge is set aside and the matter remitted to youth court to be heard according to law. In the circumstances, either party may apply to a youth court judge for an order under s. 16 of the Act to decide the proper forum to hear the charges. 1) The accused was born in 1967 and, ignoring for the moment the transition provisions of the Young Offenders Act, became an adult on […], 1985. He was therefore charged with certain offences during a period of time when the alleged offences occurred. It is common ground that youth court judges do not have jurisdiction with respect to any offences which occurred prior to the date they became adult. 2) The Court reviewed the factors set out in R. v. A.(E.A.) and found that the accused should be tried under the least onerous regime, the Youth Court. The Court considered the effects of transition provisions in the Act and in particular s.79(4) in the former Juvenile Delinquents Act. The focus of the hearing is not on guilt or innocence and at this stage of the proceedings the rules of evidence applicable to criminal proceedings are not strictly applied.","The primary issue was whether the youth court has jurisdiction in proceedings which are commenced in youth court where it was not possible to determine whether at the time the alleged offences were committed the accused was a young person or an adult. The secondary issue was whether a writ of mandamus should issue. The accused was charged with two indictable offences, sexual assault and incest, as well as acts of gross indecency. The Crown stayed an identical information previously laid against the accused alleging the same offences occurred when he was an adult. The accused became an adult in October 1985 and was charged with certain offences which occurred between 1985 and 1989. The summary conviction appeal court judge found the provincial court judge erred in declining jurisdiction and that because of the uncertainty when the alleged offences occurred, the accused should be tried under the least onerous regime, youth court. The appeal judge then ordered a writ of mandamus directing the youth court judge to render a decision. It was common ground that a youth court judge does not have jurisdiction with respect to offences committed while he was an adult. HELD: The decision of the summary conviction appeal court was set aside and the matter remitted to youth court. Either party may apply for an order under s16 to decide the proper forum to hear the charges.  1)Section 16 is the ideal vehicle for the youth court to make a proper determination of the proper jurisdiction to hear the charges. If the Crown after a complete investigation is unable to particularize the time when the offence(s) occurred and alleges that it (they) occurred over a period of time which included when the accused was a young offender and an adult, the preferable approach is to have the Crown commence the proceedings in youth court because some of the offences occurred while he was a youth. The Crown should then apply to a youth court judge for a transfer hearing under s16 to determine the proper forum to hear the charges.  2)There are two ways to determine which of the two courts should assume jurisdiction: view the facts in a manner most favorable to the accused and deem the offence was committed when the accused was a young person; or order a transfer hearing under s16(1) of the Young Offenders Act to determine whether the offences should be heard in youth court or ordinary court. 3)The transfer hearing must proceed in an impartial fashion in accordance with the principles of natural justice and s7 of the Charter. 4)Section 16(2) provides the factors to be taken into account in determining the competing interests of the youth and the public. 5)The position taken in the Ontario Court of Appeal in R.v. A(EA) does not lend itself to universal application. R. v. A(EA) is distinguishable and should be confined to its particular facts."
"The Plaintiff, who was five and one-half months pregnant, claimed against the defendant for injuries sustained when she fell and injured herself on premises occupied by the defendant. The Plaintiff had paid $5,000 to enter a drive-in theatre and was carrying garbage from the premises. She had parked her vehicle outside the theatre and walked to the canteen to purchase some drinks and food. She tripped on a door threshold at the entrance to the theatre. HELD: The Plaintiff's claim was dismissed. The Court found that there was no unusual danger on the premises of the defendant and awarded damages for pain and suffering in the amount of $6,000.","The plaintiff fell while entering a canteen operated by the defendant. She claimed to have tripped on the concrete sidewalk located in front of the canteen. Others testified that she tripped on the door threshold of the building. Dismissing the claim, that the plaintiff's evidence of where she tripped is unreliable. Furthermore, there was no unusual danger on the premises."
"Two applications before the Court under the Family Maintenance Act s.10 seeking an order for the payment of child support by reducing the maintenance payable from $250 per month for each of the three children to the amounts specified under the Federal Child Support Guidelines as adopted by The Act; Cancellation of the arrears of $13,273.39 in maintenance payments accrued under the order; Variation of access provisions of the order with the view of providing him with greater access to the children. HELD: 1)The respondent was not in a position to pay the full monthly maintenance provided by the Order. The Guidelines do not automatically apply to the variation of maintenance payable prior to 1997. Since the Guidelines were not in force priorto 1997, they do not apply to a variation of support which should be extinguished. 2)The Court was not prepared to hear the application and advised the petitioner to apply by notice motion with appropriate supporting affidavits. 3)The total gross annual income of the respondent was $22,993.00. With respect to the two youngest children the Court was satisfied that he should have access to them not less than one full weekend per month between 6:00 p.m. on Friday to 6:30 pm on Sunday for two weeks prior notice together plus other periods of time when he is available to attend for the purposes of exercising access in a manner consistent with the best interest of the children including their need to be available for school.","In the first application under the Family Maintenance Act the father sought to reduce child maintenance of $250 per child per month to an amount in accordance with the Federal Child Support Guidelines; cancellation of arrears of $13,273.39; and increased access. In the second application the mother sought to have the paragraph in the 1994 order restraining the parents from removing the children from the province without the other's written consent or court order struck. HELD: 1)The mother was advised to apply by notice of motion with appropriate supporting affidavits.  2)The arrears were $11,838.39 as the father had paid money directly which was not accounted for in the Statement of Arrears. Since the Guidelines were not in force prior to 1997, they do not automatically apply to a support payable prior to 1997. The father's income was sufficient for him to pay child support for 1996 and 1997. Arrears for 1993 to 1995 inclusive were reduced as he was not able to pay according to the order at those times. Upon payment of $5,000 the balance of arrears accrued prior to December 31/98 would be extinguished. 3)The father was to pay child support of $325 per month for the two children. Garnishment of his wages by the Maintenance Enforcement Office were to be limited to $175 per month for arrears plus the current maintenance due. 4)The parties agreed the father should have access not less than one full weekend per month upon two weeks prior notice plus when he was available to attend at the city in a manner consistent with the children's best interests and their need to be available for school."
"A medical doctor brought an action against three doctors alleging that each of them owed a duty of trust and a fiduciary duty to act towards him in good faith in connection with an arrangement entered into by all the doctors to perform the on-call services required of them by the defendant, the Pipestone District Health Board. The doctors had been consultants to the hospital and each had a privileges to practise in the hospital. HELD: The action against the doctors was dismissed with costs to be taxed. 1)There was no evidence that the hospital entered into the arrangement by the doctors or of a binding intention by the hospital to deliver continuous care to its patients. 2)The common characteristics defining a fiduary relationship were discussed by Cameron J.A. in Baskerville v. Thurgood and were found to have been defined by the Court as follows: a class or category of doctor having privileges to practice in the Hospital; a doctor performing on- call duties; trustees or fiduciaries; the arrangement was not binding by the court or the hospital; and the doctors were not signatories to the Regulations. 3)The relationship between the doctors and the hospital was not defined by MoHSADA or the Saskatchewan Standards for Trust or a fiducary relationship. The common characteristics of a relationship between a doctor and a hospital are defined by statute and are not defined in the Regulations nor by the Standards. The relationship between all the physicians having privileges at the hospital would operate on a rotation basis to answer the on call services required by the Hospital. 4)The plaintiff was not opposed to the on demand arrangement. The only issue was whether it gave rise to a fiduitary relationship between each doctor and the defendant. The court dismissed the plaintiff's action against Crouse and Kirsch with costs.","The medical doctor alleged the other medical doctors owed a fiduciary duty to act in good faith with respect to their agreement to perform on-call services for the District Health Board. Under the voluntary arrangement doctors who chose not to enter the arrangement remained on-call to look after their own patients and to respond to emergencies. It worked well until Hanna established another clinic and began dividing his time between Regina and the Moosomin clinic. HELD: The actions against the doctors and health district were dismissed with taxed costs.  1)Hanna's exclusion from the roster was authored by his own conduct. When he was habitually late on his weekend on-call duties and sometimes failed to show at all, the remaining doctors set up a new on-call roster which did not include him. Such action was necessary under the bylaws governing the hospital and to provide good patient care to the hospital. He was not only remiss in performing his on-call duties but there were serious questions about his professional competence. He would admit a patient and fail to attend upon him or her for several days. Or he would fail to diagnose an obvious condition. His reasons for his failure to attend a meeting convened by the hospital administrator to resolve the problems was unacceptable. 2)There was no evidence of a legally binding contract between the doctors. The on-call arrangement was voluntary. There was no expressed intention that it be legally enforceable. 3)The common characteristics defining a fiduciary relationship were discussed in Baskerville v. Thurgood. There was no fiduciary with power over anyone and therefore no fiduciary relationship with respect to the doctors.  4)The relationship between the hospital and its doctors having privileges in the hospital is one that is defined by the Hospital Standards Act and Regulations and bylaws of the Health District. Consideration was also given to the relationship with the College of Physicians and Surgeons. A hospital is never, on the facts, in the position of a fiduciary towards its doctors. There was no basis in law or fact supporting the existence of a fiduciary relationship between Hanna and the Health District."
FIAT: The applicant applied for an order severing the issues raised by his claim from those raised by the cross-claim and third party proceedings so that his claim may proceed to trial. The respondent vigorously opposed severance on the grounds that the Government of Canada would be prejudiced in its claim for apportionment of the amount of any judgment as between Canada and the applicant. HELD: The application was granted and the matter which had been raised by cross- claim and third-party proceedings proceeded to an early trial. It was in the best interests of justice that the order of severance sought by the applicant should be granted so that the issue raised in the action may proceed at an early date. The action and the other actions pending resolution of this action were dealt with under the Rules.,FIAT. The applicant applied for an order severing the issues from those raised by the cross-claim and third party proceedings so that his claim may proceed to trial. The Attorney General opposed severance on the ground the Government of Canada would be prejudiced in its claim for apportionment of the amount of any judgment as between the Government of Canada and the Oblates. HELD: It was in the best interests of justice that the order of severance be granted so the issue may proceed to an early trial. The issues of cross-claim and third party proceedings will take a very lengthy period of time. Hundreds of other claimants who have been asked by the management pre-trial judge to regard the plaintiff's action as a test case were awaiting a judgment.
"The parties sought to vary the existing child support order. They have two children, Luke, age 21 and Amanda, age 18. Under the terms of the order, the respondent was paying child support in the amount of $987 per month on the basis of an income of $80,278. The petitioner is attending university. Luke decided not to go to university that fall. He commenced full-time studies at the University of Regina in September. He continues to work part-time. HELD: 1)In the circumstances at hand, it would be appropriate to calculate arrears only for support of Luke during the months of September to December. 2)Both Luke and Amanda are children of the marriage as contemplated by the Act. They are involved in the reasonable pursuit of post-secondary education and neither is able to withdraw from the obligation of their parent. The Court of Appeal in Zaba v. Bradley similarly observed that in determining whether an 'adult child' in attendance at university qualifies as a child under the Act and, if so, the extent of obligation of parents to support their child, it is not inappropriate to award the amount prescribed by the applicable Table. 3)While it would appear beyond debate that an adult child must make reasonable efforts to contribute to his or her support and education, it was not so clear how this is to be applied in an individual circumstance. To revert to such an approach is to undermine the presumptive rule and the legislated objectives of predictability, consistency and efficiency. To be inappropriate, the Table amount must 'exceed the generous ambit within which reasonable disagreement is possible'. It is not clearly excessive given the cost of maintaining the home for the children.","Both sought to vary the June 30, 1999 child support order under which the father was to pay monthly child support of $987 based on an income of $80,278. He ceased paying when the children did not attend school full-time. The 21 year old worked for several years before returning to his mother's home in August 2001 and commencing full-time studies. He continued to work part-time and obtained student loans and a student line of credit. The daughter resumed living with her mother in January 2002 and was attending university full-time. Both adult children were assuming responsibility for most of their education costs by taking student loans. The mother's position was the father should pay the table amount of support for both children and his proportionate share of post-secondary expenses not covered by student loans. At issue also was payment of arrears for July to December 2001. HELD: 1)The father was to pay $1,153 per month for support for the adult children for the months of September to April inclusive, pursuant to s.3(2)(a) and 3(1)(a) of the Guidelines. Based on the criteria set forth in Farden and Zaba, both children were children of the marriage as contemplated by the Act. They were involved in the reasonable pursuit of post-secondary education and neither was able to withdraw from the charge of their parents. It was appropriate to determine the obligation in accordance with s.3(2)(a). The student loans covered most direct education expenses of tuition, books and fees. The line of credit was not considered a part of the son's means available to meet his needs. The father has a reasonably substantial income ($96,300) and cannot seek to reduce or avoid a child support obligation by guaranteeing a loan, which the child will have to repay. Child support arrears for July to December 2001 for the son to a total of $2,872 were payable at a rate of $718 per month. The daughter's needs were met while attending university in Alberta.  3)While it would appear beyond debate that an adult child must make reasonable efforts to contribute to his or her support and education, it is not so clear how this is to be applied to an individual circumstance. The principles enunciated in Francis were recast in the context of s.3(2). A similar summary, albeit with respect to an application under s.4, is found in Metzner as reiterated in MacDonald. It is clear from Francis that determining inappropriateness is not a matter of the court determining what the budget ought to be and whether a Table amount exceeds that budget. To revert to such an approach is to undermine the presumptive rule and legislated objectives of predictability, consistency and efficiency. 4)The father was to pay his proportionate share (80%) of any expenses not covered within 30 days of such funds being due. If the parties were unable to work out an adjustment for any unused education tax credit, an application may be brought to court. 5)The mother was awarded her costs of the application fixed at $750."
"The plaintiff claims that the mutual fund ought never to have formed part of his father's estate. It was his father’s intention to name him as beneficiary of the fund but that this plan was defeated by the negligence of the defendants. The defendants’ case is submitted through the affidavit of Nordstrom. HELD: Garry Mayer has cause of action as disappointed beneficiary and that he suffered damages as result of the negligence by the defendant. The plaintiff shall have pre-judgment interest from the date of death of Mayer to the Date of this judgment and his costs to be taxed. The claim against Nordstrom was dismissed. Given that the defendant was a chartered life underwriter and financial consultant and had a business relationship with Mayer, he was intimately familiar with the transaction and was cognizant of the fact that the realization of the deceased”s intent to benefit Garry was dependent upon there being a valid beneficiary designation. Nordstrom’”professional”s knowledge of the death of the client and his failure to advance products that would meet that intent and his reliance on Mayer fathoming that beneficiary designation made was void in law, all evidence of a failure of the defendant to discharge its duty of care to its client and consequently, his negligence.","The plaintiff claims that his father intended to designate him as the sole beneficiary of a $60,000 mutual fund but that this plan was defeated by the negligence of the defendants. The defendant admitted he was aware of the deceased's intention to leave the investment to his son. The defendant entered the plaintiff's name in the beneficiary designation portions of the fund application. However, the beneficiary designation was void by virtue of the mutual fund being non-registered. The defendant gave evidence that he advised the deceased that he would have to make a specific bequest in his will. The deceased made no special designation in his will and, at his death, the investment became part of the residue of his estate and was divided between the plaintiff and his sister. HELD: The plaintiff was awarded judgment against the defendant Nordstrom for half the value of the investment at its maturity, plus pre-judgment interest and costs.  1) Nordstrom was a professional, who held himself out as possessing special skill, judgment and knowledge in financial planning. The advice and information provided to the deceased was provided in the course of the defendant's business. The defendant had a financial interest in the transaction and was cognizant of the fact that the realization of the deceased's intent to benefit the plaintiff was dependent upon there being a valid beneficiary designation. The products sold by the defendant are used as estate planning tools. The intervention of death removed any opportunity to correct the matter and, without the application of the Wilhelm principle, this financial planner would go scott free and the plaintiff would bear the loss. The 'disappointed beneficiary' principle was applicable in this case."
"The plaintiff, who had been injured in a motor vehicle accident, applied to set aside the jury notice filed by the defendant and his wife, who died shortly after the plaintiff's treatment. The medical evidence presented by the doctor was of such complexity that it should be assessed by a judge and not a jury. Awarding the plaintiff $2,500 plus disbursements relating directly to the application, that the jury will not be able to understand the complexity of the evidence and that the applicant's substantive right to a trial by jury should be denied. The court found that there were not sufficient cogent reasons to strike the jury in this case.","The defendant doctor in a personal injury case applied to set aside the Jury Notice filed by the plaintiff. Application dismissed; the evidence would not be so complex and scientific that the plaintiff's substantive right to a jury trial should be denied. Although the medical charts exceeded 1500 pages, the more relevant hospital records were less than 100 pages; the essence of the liability issue would be limited in time, in the most relevant anatomical area and in the number of medical personnel involved in the relevant interventions; the factual material did not appear to be in dispute; and the issues were no more complex than most causation issues presented in medical malpractice cases."
"The plaintiffs sued the defendants pursuant to Part Forty of the Queen's Bench Rules for damages arising to them from alleged nuisance and negligence caused by the defendants, Great Plains Leaseholds Ltd. and the Town of White City with respect to their operation of the Emerald Park Golf and Country Club Ltd. The plaintiffs live adjacent to one another and abut the ninth hole of the golf course. Until recently the defendant golf course was owned and operated by the defendant, Emerald Park. In January 2005, the property was purchased by the White City who entered into an agreement with Great Plains and Lorch Associates Ltd. to continue to operate the golfcourse in a manner that causes errant golf balls to enter the plaintiffs' property. HELD: The Court held that few golf balls of 10-20 over a 5-year period with limited damage to property did not constitute continuing nuisance. The defendants were liable to all of the plaintiffs in negligence for the failure over the past years to remedy or eliminate this hazardous and dangerous situation.  1) The plaintiffs were entitled to injunctive relief to put an end to the nuisance which had continued for the past nine years.  2) The Court refused to order the specific course of action that the defendants should take in order to remedy the problem.  3) The plaintiff plaintiffs were ordered to pay $18,000 for the loss of use and enjoyment of their property over the next nine years and $6,000 to settle the claim by Bosenberg and Strassburg who continue to have the same problem.","The plaintiffs seek damages arising from the alleged nuisance and negligence caused the defendants in the operation of the golf course. The plaintiffs also seek an injunction to prohibit the defendants from continuing to operate the golf course in a manner that causes errant golf balls to enter the plaintiffs' property. HELD: 1) The court looked at other jurisdictions for guidance as to what number of errant balls might constitute a nuisance. It would appear that anything from 200 golf balls and up over the span of a year is definitely an unreasonable interference with the use and enjoyment of one's own property. Over a span of 9 years, the plaintiffs have had approximately 1,000 golf balls per year enter their property. In this case, the number of golf balls being hit onto the adjacent properties from the defendant's golf course is far greater than the number cited in many of the cases put forward. There is no doubt then that the present operation of the ninth hole is a nuisance and continues to be a nuisance.  2) The wording of the Optionee's Indemnity clause is of little value to the defendants given the evidence of the parties. The evidence confirms that when the residential area was developed and the contract signed, no one, including the operator, anticipated the extent of the existing problem. Accordingly, the plaintiffs could not have agreed to save the defendant harmless from a problem of this magnitude. 3) The plaintiffs will be compensated for the extensive physical damaged to the plaintiffs' properties, but also for the loss of the use and enjoyment of their yards for 7 months of the year. 4) The plaintiffs are entitled to injunctive relief to put an end to the nuisance that has continued for the past 9 years. The defendants are enjoined from allowing golfers from hitting golf balls on the ninth hole so that they land anywhere near the plaintiffs' property."
The accused is charged with resisting arrest contrary to s. 129(a) of the Criminal Code. The defence argues that there were insufficient grounds for the accused's arrest and that the accused was therefore justified in resisting his detention. The Crown's position is that in these circumstances the police were justified in arresting the accused for being drunk in public. HELD: The Court finds beyond a reasonable doubt that the officers were engaged in the lawful execution of their duty when the accused resisted their efforts to arrest him pursuant to the Summary Offences Procedure Act. The arrest was lawful. The Court makes the following finding of the facts: The Crown has proved beyond a reasonably doubt that The Police were engaged In the lawful Execution of Their Duty when they resisted the arrest of the accused who is over 6 feet in height and weighs more than 3 hundred pounds. OC spray was used but had no immediate affect on the accused. The accused was eventually handcuffed and placed in the back of a police car. The court takes issue with the defence's argument that the police should have questioned the accused as to where else he might go to sleep off his intoxication.,"The accused was charged with resisting arrest contrary to s. 129(a) of the Criminal Code. The defence argued that there were insufficient grounds for the accused's arrest and he was therefore justified in resisting his detention. The Crown's position was that the police were justified in arresting the accused for being drunk in public. HELD: The Crown has proved beyond a reasonable doubt that the officers were engaged in the lawful execution of their duty when the accused resisted their efforts to arrest him pursuant to The Summary Offences Procedure Act. There was a complaint to police concerning the accused. He was heard and seen banging on the door of an apartment. He smelled of alcohol. He was slightly unsteady on his feet and he was yelling and swearing at the police. Given the complaint and the observations made by the attending constables, it was reasonable for them to believe that the accused was intoxicated due to the use of alcohol. He was causing a disturbance to others. Prior to his arrest, the accused began to yell at the officers in a parking lot which is, without any doubt, a public place. No one else was present who may have been capable and willing to take charge of the accused. The defence argued that in these circumstances the arresting officers should have questioned that accused as to where else he might go to sleep off his intoxication. The Crown submitted that in circumstances such as this, the police are not required to sit down and discuss with the accused where he might go. In the Court's view, s. 52(2) of The Summary Offences Procedure Act should be interpreted as meaning that there must be no other person present at the scene who is capable and willing to take care of the person who is subject to arrest. There was no such person in this case. The arrest was, on these facts, lawful."
"The appellant appealed his conviction and sentence for 'unlawfully have sunscreen in front side windows' contrary to's.66(3) the Vehicle Equipment Regulations (VEH)'. The charge, as drafted, was so palpably bad it did not give fair notice to the defendant of the nature of the charge nor the penalties that may be imposed if a breach was established. HELD: The appeal was allowed and the conviction declared void because the charge was not a nullity. The appeal could not be amended so as to breathe life into something that was nullity, such as an 'offence not known to law' such as the one set out in S.6 of the Traffic Safety Act. 1)The Court found that the charge, so palpley bad, does not give a fair and proper basis to disturb the conviction entered or the fine imposed. 2)The count is a null nullity and is void ab initio. The Court invited both the Crown and the appellant to address the issue of the sufficiency of the charges and found that, even if the charge is a correct one, it is not possible to amend the count so as cure the defect.  3)The appeal was permitted and the charge declared void. The conviction was quashed.","The accused was charged with having aftermarket tint on the side windows of his vehicle. He appealed on other grounds. The summary conviction appeal judge raised the issue of the sufficiency of the charge on its own motion. The face of the ticket purported to charge the accused with an offence under s. 66(3) of The Vehicle Equipment Regulations. HELD: The charge was declared a nullity because it was drafted so poorly that it did not give fair notice to the accused of the charge or the penalty to be imposed if breach was established. Section 66(3) of The Vehicle Equipment Regulations purports to make displaying aftermarket tint an offence, but the section is a charging offence and does not prescribe a penalty. The correct way to charge an accused with this offence is under s. 113 of The Traffic Safety Act which makes it an offence to operate a motor vehicle on a public highway that is not equipped in accordance with the regulations. The count could not be amended to cure the defect because the charge was a nullity and void ab initio. The conviction was quashed."
"The accused is charged with aggravated assault and breach of a peace officer. The accused pled guilty to two counts and in the information, being a curfew breach and an alcohol abstention breach on his undertaking. At the argument stage of this trial, the Crown indicated they were not seeking a conviction on the count related to the alleged assault on the complainant. HELD: The Court was left with the issue of whether or not a defence of self-defence was available to the accused and whether it was properly identified and therefore properly acting as a police officer in the line of duty. The Court found that the accused was guilty of both counts. The first count was a breach of the peace and the injury to the complainant's ankle which was a broken nose. The second count was an assault on a public officer which was clearly a wounding as the complainant was on his back on the boulevard beside the van and was being assaulted by the accused when the accused exited the vehicle and literally flew at the complainant, flailing his arms and fists and as result of him defending himself from the assault he fell and the assault resulted in his ankle being broken.","The accused was a passenger in a van where the driver was stunting on the complainant's street. The complainant was an off duty police officer who left his home and knocked on the passenger window. The accused exited the van and assaulted the complainant resulting in the complainant receiving a broken nose and ankle. The accused was charged with aggravated assault and assaulting a police officer. The accused asserted a defence of self-defence to the charge of assault and questioned whether the complainant was properly identified and acting as a police officer in the line of duty at the time of the incident. HELD: The accused was convicted of aggravated assault and acquitted of the charge of assaulting a peace officer. 1) Regardless of whether the complainant was acting in the course of his duties as a police officer, he had a lawful right to intervene to prevent the continuation of the breach of the peace he witnessed. Even if the original actions of the accused might be viewed as originally defensive in nature, he clearly used more force than was necessary to defend himself.  2) Although three of the Crown's witnesses identified that the complainant identified himself as a police officer, none of the versions of what occurred were consistent with the other. The Court was left with doubt as to whether the mens rea of assaulting police officer was proven, namely that the accused knew that the officer in question was in fact a police officer."
"HELD: The application was granted. The court ordered a declaration interpreting the bylaws of the Condominium Corporation with regard to the election of the members of the Board with a view to determining the voting rights of the commercial owners. It found that principles of contract interpretation had no place within the scope of the within application, being the interpretation of a condominium bylaw. As there were only seven positions on the board, a vote was required. The commercial owners were entitled to nominate up to three persons for election to the Board and the board members were not entitled to any more than one vote. The respondent directors were elected as result of a vote by the commercial owner of three of the three commercial units. A decision on the respondent directors was made pursuant to Queen's Bench Rule 319 and the preliminary decision of the Court clarifying what the Court would disregard was provided prior to the argument of the merits of the application.","The applicant is a residential unit owner in the condominium corporation. He sought a declaration pursuant to Queen's Bench Rule 664 interpreting the bylaws of the condominium corporation with respect to the voting rights of the commercial unit owners. The condominium has 32 units with the three largest units being commercial units. The remaining 29 units are residential. The parties agreed that the commercial owners were entitled to nominate and vote for three positions on the Board of Directors. A dispute arose as to whether the commercial owners were entitled to vote on the election of the positions on the Board designated for representatives of the residential unit holders. The Board of Directors passed a resolution interpreting the bylaw such that the commercial owners were entitled to nominate up to three people for election to the Board, all owners were entitled to vote on all nominees, all the owners agreed to cast their votes so as to elect the commercial owners nominees and where that does not happen the commercial owners are entitled to vote as a class to elect their nominees and there is no restriction in the bylaw limiting the right of the commercial owners to vote on positions to the Board. HELD The appropriate standard of review is that of reasonableness and deference must be given to the Board of Directors with regard to its interpretation of the bylaw. There is no specific provision in the bylaws that would restrict the voting rights of the commercial owners. Prohibiting any owner from voting altogether would be contrary to s. 41 of The Condominium Property Act because the Act provides that all owners are to vote on all questions proposed at any meeting. The proper interpretation of the bylaws has nothing to do with the principles of contract interpretation. The application was dismissed. The interpretation of the bylaw by the Board of Directors was reasonable and that Court was not prepared to interfere with it."
"The applicants sought to consolidate their claim against the defendants, with three other actions, all involving the same defendants and allegations regarding the improper negligent conduct of an investment advisor.  They argued that there were common issues and facts between the actions, and that experts would be called to testify about the same matters as well as the common law issues. Motion dismissed; the matters should be heard together or in sequence.  There was no evidence before the Court to establish that the defendants and the plaintiffs were at the same stage of litigation. The Court was asked to consider whether the law with respect to consolidation had become unclear since the advent of the new Rules. It was not possible to determine the degree of commonality, in what the pleadings disclose as being four relatively complex actions.",",  motion denied. The court considered Rule 37.02(c) and distinguished between the terms 'same' and 'similar' with respect to claims involving the 'same transaction' and determined the use of the term 'same' indicated it must involve the same transaction and not merely similar transactions. The court stated that there should be more than a single common question of law or question of fact except in the simplest of cases to grant a motion for consolidation. The more issues and facts in common, the more supportive those factors will be toward consolidation. The court found there was insufficient evidence of commonality between the actions and dismissed the applicants' motion for consolidation on the basis that the actions were based on similar transactions but not the same transactions. The court did not consider the applicant's request to have the matters heard sequentially because it was raised only during their reply oral submissions to the court. The court suggested that Rule 37.04, which would have allowed for common issues to be tried or heard together, would have been most applicable but was not relied upon by the applicants. The court dismissed the motion."
"FIAT: This is an application by Saskatchewan Government Insurance on behalf of the defendant for an order pursuant to Rule 107(c) of the Queen's Bench Rules and s.7 of the Contributory Negligence Act granting leave to the defendant to add the City of Saskatoon as a third party to this action. The plaintiff alleges that the road condition was icy on the exit ramp leading up to the Buckwold Bridge and the city had not taken steps to address the icy road surfaces. To refuse the application would result in the requirement for a second litigation process to be commenced, that being by the defendants against the proposed third party claiming contributory negligence. The applicant argues that s. 308 of The Cities Act, s. 2002, which reads: 308 city is not liable for damage caused by the presence, absence or insufficiency of any earth, rock, tree or thing adjacent to or in along or on a street that is not on the travelled portion of the street. There is no causal connection between the cause of action pled in the statement of claim and the plaintiff's claim.","SGI applied on behalf of the defendant for an order under Queen's Bench Rule 107A(c) and s. 7 of The Contributory Negligence Act for leave to add the City of Saskatoon as a third party to the action. The defendant is being sued by the plaintiff for damage caused to a construction site under a bridge in Saskatoon. The damage is alleged to have been caused when the defendant's truck left the ramp leading onto the bridge and fell into an excavation pit. The defendant argues that the City should be added as a third party because the City did not take proper steps to clear snow from the ramp, which provided a surface for his vehicle to launch off of. HELD: The application to add the City of Saskatoon as a third party was granted. The applicant has made out a prima facie case against the proposed third party. There is no prejudice to the plaintiff because he has settled with his insurer and is requesting settlement with the defendant's insurer. There is a causal connection between the cause of action plead in the statement of claim and the third party notice. It is immaterial at this stage that the City may have an absolute defence."
"FIAT: The wife seeks an order requiring the husband to pay the equalization payment under a consent judgment or alternatively that the consent judgment be set aside and trial dates ordered. HELD: 1) The consent judgment is to be interpreted in the same manner as an agreement. Negotiations are not relevant. The fact it was not specifically spelled out in the judgment is not fatal. Recognition of a discount for tax on RRSPs was explicit in the wife's pre-trial calculations, in her calculations, and in all valuations of property discussed thereafter. If the wife had laid out discounted values for the RRs, one would expect the husband, if he wanted to use unreduced RRSP values, to demand explicit language in the judgement if he wished to use them to satisfy the equalizer payment or not. 2) The court was able to determine the appropriate amount of costs within the meaning of the judgment.  3) The parties were encouraged to try and resolve the matter themselves. They were unable to do so. 4) The judgment speaks from the time it is pronounced. It is common practice in family property distributions to discount RRSP assets to their after tax value. The petitioner shall have judgment as against the respondent in this amount. Should the respondent choose to rollover RRSP monies, the amount of RRSP funds to be transferred must be increased by a factor of 1.3. This is to account for the taxable nature of the RRSP fund. The parties cannot hide behind restrictive and literal interpretation to circumvent the order.","The applicant wife sought an order requiring the husband to pay the equalization payment under a consent judgment or alternatively that the consent judgment be set aside and trial dates ordered. The consent judgment provided that the husband should make an equalization payment of $105,000 to be composed of cash and/or a rollover of retirement funds. The husband wants to satisfy the judgment by paying the sum of $5,000 in cash and rolling over $100,000 in RRSPs, unreduced for tax. Applying a 25% discount for tax, the proposal is equivalent to $80,000. The husband argued that the consent order was not dispositive and that if the tax implications were a controlling factor they should have been specifically addressed in the judgment.HELD: The Court held that it is common practice in family property distributions to discount RRSPs to their after-tax value. The fact that that principle was not stated explicitly in the judgment was not fatal to the application. The evidence introduced at the hearing of the wife's position in pre-trial calculations clearly indicated that she expected the discount for tax on RRSPs. Therefore, the Court ordered that the judgment be satisfied by way of rollover of RRSPs in the amount of $111,600."
"The accused was charged with two counts of sexual assault contrary to s. 271(1) and for sexual purposes touching a person under the age of 16 directly with part of his body contrary to ss. 151 of the Criminal Code. The accused was acquitted of both charges. The Court found that the accused had not believed the complainant's testimony and that she did not wish to be seen by the public. The complainant did not have any problems with the accused. The evidence of K.S. as to what transpired in her bedroom was also found to be unreliable. The court gave the accused credit for 22:9.5 of the trial. The judge was required to instruct the jury that they need not firmly believe or disbelieve any witness or set of witnesses and that this is desirable development. The Crown did not revoke the assumption formerly applied to all evidence of children, often unjustly, that children's evidence is always less reliable than the evidence of adults.",HELD: The Court found that the accused was guilty of both charges. The Court believed the testimony of the complainant.
"The Crown appeals the acquittal of the respondent from a charge of dangerous driving causing bodily harm contrary to s. 249(3) of the Criminal Code. The Crown appeals this acquittal. The respondent was tried on this charge before judge alone and was acquitted on October 10, 2013. The reasons that follow are dismissed. In this view, the Crown has failed to overcome the heavy onus required to overturn appeals from acquittals under s. 676(1)(a) of The Code. HELD: The Crown argues that the trial judge erred in law in three respects. First, the trial court correctly stated and applied the elements of dangerous drive. Second, the court was not satisfied that the Crown had not established beyond reasonable doubt that the speed of the accused's vehicle was anything more than 93 to 99 kilometres per hour or that it was objectively dangerous in the circumstances. The trial judge went on to state that the accused’s speed needed to be proved beyond a reasonable doubt several more times. However, a closer reading suggests the trial did not confuse the factual issue of the appellant’ speed with either the actus reus or the mens rea of dangerous riding. The court found that the appellant had not misapprehended the elements as required to establish dangerous driving. The appeal court found the Crown’ s. 7 Charter rights were violated. The appellant”s right to be free from imprisonment was violated.” HELD : The appeal is dismissed. The Court found that in order to obtain new trial evidence, the Court must first prove that the verdict would not necessarily have been the same if the trial had properly directed the jury. The accused” s. 9 Charter rights was violated because the trial officer did not misapply the law. The evidence was properly presented to the court. The errors of law were not properly addressed by the trial lawyer but were properly addressed in the trial decision. The decision of the trial board was therefore correct. The error of law is not the only one the Crown could have tried to prove. The case law is clear and clear that the only thing that could have been proved beyond reasonable doubts was the speed. The facts do not establish a marked departure from the standard of care expected of a reasonable person at that time of day on a stretch of roadway assuming that there were no construction workers or construction equipment in the area. The law is correctly set out. The judge correctly stated the elements and applied them.","The Crown did not meet the onus under s. 676(1)(a) of the Criminal Code, and therefore the appeal was dismissed. The Appeal Court found that the Crown must satisfy the court of two things: 1) that an error of law was made on the standard of correctness; and 2) that the error had a material bearing on the acquittal. The Court of Appeal dealt with the Crown’s arguments as follows: 1) while it is an error to mistake the elements of an offence the Court found that the trial judge did not do so. The trial judge did, unfortunately, state that the speed needed to be proved beyond a reasonable doubt but the trial judge did not confuse the factual speed issue with either the mens rea or actus reus; 2) the trial judge thoroughly reviewed each of the witnesses’ testimony. The trial judge did not have to refer to every piece of evidence or explain exactly how each piece of evidence was weighed or considered in the reasons; and 3) the trial judge did err in applying the criminal standard of proof beyond a reasonable doubt to the different pieces of evidence going to the vehicle’s speed. The trial judge concluded that the minimum speed must be accepted because the higher speeds were not proven beyond a reasonable doubt. The Court of Appeal concluded that the verdict would not have necessarily been different but for the error in law; speed was the only driving factor suggested to be dangerous. The Crown also questioned the admissibility of the analyst’s opinion evidence on appeal, although they did not at trial. The Crown was not allowed to raise arguments on appeal that were not raised at trial. The analyst was originally a Crown witness at the preliminary inquiry and then he was a defence witness at trial. Further, the Appeal Court declined to give an opinion on the weight that should have been given to the analyst’s testimony because that was a question of fact for the trial judge."
"The Director applied for an order directing the forfeiture of $10,475.00 of property to the Crown in Saskatchewan. The property had been seized by the Regina Police Service from the William Ross Butler in 2008. Since the dispute in response to those proceedings, the Director applied to this Court for a forfeiture order pursuant to Part II.1 of the 2009 Act. HELD: The application was brought four months later and fell comfortably within the two year limitation window prescribed by s.35.1. The Director's application was not statute barred and there was no limitations issue. The Court found that s.34.1 is the correct wording to describe the legislation. The legislation is civil not criminal in nature and it is not made expressly retroactive. The Act provides that the person does not have to be charged with a criminal offence for the Director to pursue civil remedies under this statute. The starting point for the commencement of the limitation period is not the date of seizure as is the date that the director became satisfied that the property was proceeds of unlawful activity. The reality is that the Director commenced proceedings under the 2009 act thus the Director's authority to pursue a forfeiture application must be assessed from that perspective alone.","HELD: The issues were determined as follows: 1) the applicant applied pursuant to The Seizure of Criminal Property Act, 2009, as that version of the Act was in place at the time of the seizure. The respondent argued that s. 35.1 did not apply at the time of seizure, because it was not in the Act at the time of seizure. The respondent argued that the two-year limitation period pursuant to The Limitations Act applied to the application with the date of seizure being the date of discoverability. The respondent also argued that the 2009 Act did not have retrospective application. The court found that the applicant applied pursuant to the 2009 Act and therefore the matter was assessed from that perspective. Section 35.1 of the 2009 Act required applications for forfeiture to be made within two years from the director becoming satisfied that the property sought to be forfeited was proceeds of unlawful activity or an instrument of unlawful activity. The court found that the words “Notwithstanding The Limitations Act” at the beginning of s. 35.1 served to provide an intention to prioritize the content of s. 35.1 over The Limitations Act. An affidavit filed by the applicant indicated that the director became satisfied that the property was an instrument of unlawful activity after August 2016. The director’s application was brought four months later, well within the two-year limitation period. The court then considered whether the 2009 Act had retrospective application and found that B. had the same legal position and faced the same jeopardy regardless of the version of the legislation, and therefore, there was no retrospective problem;  2) s. 7 outlined the test to apply. The court accepted the expert’s evidence with regards to the significance of the factors evidencing drug trafficking and how common they were to the drug trafficking trade. The applicant’s evidence also showed that the person alleging to purchase the truck from the respondent was not the purchaser and the purchase price was $8,000, not $16,000. The court found it more likely than not that the money was proceeds of unlawful activity; and 3) B. did not provide evidence or argument to support the exception that forfeiture would clearly not be in the interests of justice. The property was found to be proceeds of unlawful activity and the forfeiture order was granted."
This was an application by the applicant for an order prohibiting the law firms from acting as counsel for the Trustee of the estate. The Trustee had been appointed by the Bank as custodian of the property of the bankrupt and claimed to be creditor of the bankruptcy. The Bank opposed the Trustees application. The applicant sought independent legal advice on the matter. The Respondent Bank declined to object. The Application was Dismissing. The Court found that the conflict of interest between the counsel for each party was so blatant that it demanded the removal of them. The respondents should not be advised by counsel for both the Trust and the Bank.,"This was an application for an order prohibiting the law firm that represented the respondent bank from acting as counsel for the trustee of the bankrupt company's estate. The applicant argued that there were significant areas where the interests of the bank conflicted with interests of the creditors. The trustee, who must act in the best interest of all creditors, should not be advised by the bank's counsel. Granting the order. The court, applying its supervisory powers, found the trustee should not be represented by the bank's counsel. On Appeal."
"This was an appeal from a decision of the Nova Scotia Municipal Board directing the City of Halifax to amend zoning map ZM‑17 for the purpose of increasing the height restriction on a property in Halifax to 75 feet. The applicant sought to build an apartment building within the city's land-use bylaw. The board denied the appeal. Allowing the appeal, that the board did not exceed its jurisdiction in reviewing the decision of Council.","This was an appeal of a Municipal Board decision which overturned city council's refusal to allow the respondent's application to vary the height restriction on a proposed project. The proposal met all requirements of the Municipal Planning Strategy. Dismissing the appeal, that the Board did not exceed its jurisdiction in reviewing council's decision."
"The plaintiff rented a paint sprayer from a shop which was owned by the defendant. He signed a form of agreement and was told how to clean the gun part of the sprayer after completion of the work. No warning was given respecting any hazards in using the sprayers, and no warning was printed on the agreement. HELD: The plaintiff's finger was amputated at the second knuckle. The Court assessed the plaintiff's damages for pain and suffering and loss ofamenities at $10,000. 1)The non-pecuniary damage issue was uncomplicated. An ordinary user of paint sprayers would not have noticed that his finger was in front of the nozzle when it was injected. 2)The plaintiff was unaware of the waiver term. 3)The waiver was ineffective. 4)The Court found that the defendant was liable for the damage suffered by the plaintiff as a consequence of the defendant's negligence in failing to warn the plaintiff of the danger in using an airless paintbrush. 5)The defendant was awarded judgment for $18,789.50 plus costs and pre-judgment interest.","The Plaintiff rented a paint sprayer from the Defendant. He accidentally injected one of his fingers with paint. The finger had to be amputated. He commenced these proceedings against the Defendant seeking damages for a failure to warn him of the danger associated with the use of the paint sprayer. HELD: Judgment for the Plaintiff.  1)The paint sprayer was of the 'airless' type. It operated at 2,500 lbs. pressure. This would not have been appreciated by the ordinarily prudent user. The Defendant therefore had a duty to warn. 2)The Defendant could not escape liability because the sprayer had been rented from a location owned and operated by an independent contractor. Where an enterprise or activity is inherently dangerous, the duty to warn can not be delegated. In such a situation the party who retains the independent contractor remains vicariously liable. 3)The waiver in the rental contract was ineffective. It was a standard form agreement signed on its face with the terms of the contract on the reverse. 4)The Plaintiff was awarded general damages of $10,000.00, $5,000.00 for loss of earning capacity and recovered $3,789.50 for SHSP. 5)The usual increase in general damages for inflation and pre-judgment interest were both reduced because the Plaintiff had not presecuted his action expeditiously."
FIAT. The Court had preferred to adjourn the discharge hearing for a period of 6 months. This would allow the Court to assess the financial circumstances of the bankrupt and her spouse at that time. HELD: The Court would prefer to adjourn for a further six months. A date for the hearing to reconvene was not decided.,"Fulltext of judgment follows: After careful consideration, I would prefer to adjourn the discharge hearing for a period of 6 months. This would allow the Court to assess the financial circumstances of the bankrupt and her spouse at that time.

"The parties were married in 1973 and separated in 1994. There were two children of the marriage, Chad, born in 1976 and 1978. The parties were engaged throughout the marriage and had two children, Chad and Ryan. Chad was in high school and was dependant on the mother. Through the circumstances of the debts and Scott's bankruptcy, the mother had been employed as a nurse but had not retired. She was also an undischarged bankrupt. HELD: The husband was to pay child support of $260 per month for a period of 36 years. The matrimonial home was to be sold and the proceeds to be divided equally between the parties.","Issues included the division of a pension, child and spousal support and whether to transfer or have sold the matrimonial home which had a small equity. The petitioner was an undischarged bankrupt and any funds in his possession belonged to the trustee. The only marital asset of any value was the petitioner's pension but lump sum payment was not available for five years as there was a liquidity problem. The parties had been 'spenders' not 'savers'. HELD: 1)The respondent was to pay child support for one child. 2)Spousal support was denied. 3)The matrimonial home was to be sold and proceeds were to be divided equally.  4)Three values were suggested for valuation and distribution of the pension plan. The retirement method of calculating the value of the pension yields the fairest value as opposed to the termination method. The practice by the plan administrator on marriage breakdown was to divide the pension on the basis of the commuted value only and excess contributions were not considered for the purpose of the lump sum transfer to a locked in spousal RRSP. The options were to leave the funds in the plan and defer payment until age 65 or have the commuted value transferred to a locked-in RRSP. The respondent was to make the choice between the only two options. If she wished to have the funds in her name immediately, she was to provide written notification otherwise there would be an order that the respondent is to receive a portion when the monthly pension benefit commences."
"FIAT. The applicant sought an order pursuant to s. 159(3) of the Land Titles Act that the caveats set out in itsoriginating notice shall continue until further order of the Court, or until withdrawn. The respondent was seeking to lapse the caveats and served notices to lapse on the applicant. Each of the caveats is based on an agreement taken by Freeholders Oil Company from the registered owner of the minerals. HELD: The application to continue the caveats was dismissed with costs to the applicant and the respondent in the amount of $1,000.  1)The court found that there was a prima facie agreement in existence upon which the Caveator did not have an interest and that each of the agreements were still in existence and that Home Oil was the valid successor of the interest of the Freeholders. 2)The respondent had failed to produce all necessary documents. Further documentation would be required by a trial judge to determine the issue of thevalidity of Home's interest in the leases involved, including the matter of whether Home's lease violates the rule against perpetuities.  3)The applicant did not meet the onus on it to establish the agreement for sale. There was no evidence presented by Home Oil that it had signed any agreements with respect to establishing the validity of its caveats. 4)HELD: Home's application was ordered to continue. The caveats were to be discontinued until a further order is filed in the Land Tittles Office or until such time as they are withdrawn indue form as provided for under the Act.",FIAT. The applicant sought an order pursuant to s. 159(3) of the Land Titles Act to continue caveats until further court order or until withdrawn. The respondent had served notice to lapse all of the caveats which were based on an agreement taken by Freeholders Oil from the registered owner of the minerals. The respondent sought an order directing the caveats be continued on the condition Home Oil commence an action within a reasonable time to determine their validity. At issue was whether the caveator or the challenger should be required to initiate an action. HELD: The caveats were to be continued until a further court order was filed in the Land Titles Office or until they were withdrawn. 1) Each of the agreements was prima facie still in existence as there had been no cancellation or rescission of the agreements and Home Oil was the valid successor of the interest of Freeholders. 2) Further documentation would be required by a trial judge to determine the issue of the validity of Home Oil's interest in the leases including whether Home Oil's lease violated the rule against perpetuities.  3) Home Oil was given its costs of the application.
"The appellant pled guilty to a charge of fraud exceeding $5,000 contrary to s. 380(1)(a) of the Criminal Code. She immediately accepted responsibility for her actions, cooperated with the authorities and pled guilty at the earliest opportunity. No explanation, other than one consistent with greed and envy, was ever given for the commission of the offence. Only about $17,000 was recovered from bank account of the appellant.

"This appeal was from an order of a Barclay J. which quashed an interim order of the Labour Relations Board pending the determination of a grievance by an arbitration board, even though no proceedings were pending before the labour Relations Board, and even though it had no power to make any final order respecting the proceedings before the arbitration board. HELD: The appeal was dismissed with costs in the usual way. Whether one approaches the question from the point of view of the plain meaning of the words of s. 5.3, or from the context of the entire statute, or with a purposive approach, the result is the same. The chambers judge arrived at a correct conclusion. The ordinary meaning of s5.3 require two conditions: the existence of an application or complaint (e.g. an application to and order) and the existenceof power in the Labour Board to make final order.","An appeal from an order which quashed an interim order of the Labour Relations Board (LRB) pending the determination of a grievance by an arbitration board, even though no proceedings were pending before the LRB and even though it had no power to make a final order respecting the proceedings before the arbitration board. At issue was whether s5.3 of the Trade Union Act authorized the Board to make such an order. HELD: The appeal was dismissed with costs.  1)The Board recognized the question to be a jurisdictional question. The standard of review is whether the decision was correct rather than patently unreasonable. 2)The chambers judge arrived at the correct conclusion whether from the point of view of the plain meaning of the words of s5.3 or the context of the entire statute or a purposive approach.  3)S5.3 refers to the 'board' which is defined by s2(c) to be the LRB and accordingly referred to applications and orders of the LRB. The interim power is not only based on the final power but is also part of the final power and both are part of the same process. 4)S25(1), when read with ss(1.1) and (1.2) indicates an intention on the part of the legislators to grant exclusive jurisdiction to arbitration boards to deal with disputes arising out of the interpretation of collective agreements. 5)Whatever the scope of s42, it cannot be used to release the restrictions of a statutory provision the very purpose of which is to define the jurisdiction of the LRB to act in respect of such matters."
"The question in this case was whether the right of appeal to a board of revision against a municipal tax assessment was exercised properly, or at least effectively, having regard for the governing provisions of the statute and the fact of how and when notice of appeal was given. HELD: The appeal from the decision of the Committee will be allowed, with costs as usual, and there will be an order directing the board of revisions to hear and determine the company's appeal. 1)The phrase'may give notice in writing' must be taken by implication to allow for notice to be given by means of registered mail. This is a less formal expression suggesting a less exacting term and it is easier to suggest notice might be given in registered mail than to be applied by local people with no special training. 2)The appeal from this decision of a Committee will proceed with costs and there is an order directed the board to hear the company appeal.","At issue was whether the right of appeal to a board of revision against a municipal tax assessment was exercised properly having regard for s303(1) of the Rural Municipality Act and how and when notice was given. The company posted the notice of appeal by registered mail the day before the expiration of the 20 day appeal period. The notice arrived at the post office on a Friday, the day after the period expired and was picked up by the administrator the following Monday. The Appeals Committee refused to direct the board of revision to hear the appeal on the basis the company failed to give notice within the period prescribed by s303(1) and concluded that the board did not have the power to extend the time. HELD: The appeal was allowed. The board of revision was directed to hear and determine the assessment appeal. 1)The Committee did not err in deciding the prescribed time period for an appeal could not be extended.  2)The less formal expression 'to give notice to' as used in the Act is a less exacting term than 'to serve notice upon'. Wascana Energy exercised its right of appeal properly, or at least effectively, requiring the board of revision to entertain the appeal."

HELD: 1)The father's income from 1995 to the current date is determined to be $27,600. The mother has set out a reasonable basis for disallowing certain expenses. The claim for gas and repairs is significantly higher than in previous years and no explanation is offered. The capital payments for land and machinery and the costs of the step child's pet should properly be excluded. 2)The farm income will be adjusted in 1997 and 1998 by adding back 25 percent of the capital cost allowance for this year.  3)There is no evidence why the child attends high school there, why the expense isnecessary in relation to the child's best interests or whether the child has any means to contribute to the expense. That aspect of the claim is refused, but with leave to return the issue to Court with appropriate supporting materials.","FIAT. An application to vary maintenance for two children under the Federal Child Supprt Guidelines. At issue were the determination of the father's income and whether the expenses of the eldest child attending Grade 12 in Manitoba constituted extaordinary expenses for secondary school education pursuant to s7(1)(d). The father's reduced farm income was explained as due to poor crop yields. He anticipated being laid off from his work at the mine in October. He claimed significant vehicle expenses for his travel to work. The mother contested many of his expenses as being overstated. HELD: The respondent's child support obligation was $347 per month. 1)It was fair and reasonable to take an average of the 1997 and projected 1998 income. The preceeding years were not significant because the father's current income at the mine commenced in May 1997. Travelling expenses would not be considered in the absence of the accounting advice to explain the basis for the deduction and to establish the actual amount and where no deduction has been made in the past. No explanation was offered for why the claims for gas and repairs were significantly higher than in previous years. The capital payments for land and machinery and the costs of the stepchild's horse were excluded. In the circumstances the acquisition of equipment and capital cost allowance, in lieu of renting, was not patently unreasonable. The farm income was adjusted in 1997 and 1998 by adding back 25 percent of the capital cost allowance for the new truck. The acquisition of a $43,000 vehicle was an extravagance given his income bracket and his obligation to support his children. His allocation of one-half its cost to farming was questionable given the distances tavelled during his employment at the mine. 2)There was no evidence why the child attended high school in Manitoba, why the expense was necessary in relation to the child's best interest and whether the child had any means to contribute. Leave was given to return the matter to the Court with the appropriate supporting materials.  3)No order as to costs."
"The defendants sought to set aside a default judgment entered by the plaintiff against them and have the plaintiff's claim struck out. The defendants abandoned their alternate claim to be granted leave to file a statement of defence. The present case is one of those circumstances where the bank has an action in restitution against the holder of a certified cheque as payment does not satisfy just debt. The defendant in this instance had already deposited the replacement cheque when the original cheque was presented for certification and subsequently deposited by the defendants. The certified cheq did not satisfy a just debt as the defendants had already received payment for their services. The plaintiff claims there are exceptions to the irrevocable nature of certified cheques and that there is case law, in addition to that of Barclays Bank v. Simms, that establishes that where drawee bank honours a cheque notwithstanding a valid countermand and the effect is to satisfy just a debt, the bank may successfully defend an action by its customer/drawer/owner. Application dismissed.","The defendants sought to set aside a default judgment and have the plaintiff's claim struck out. The defendants abandoned their alternate claim to be granted leave to file a statement of defence. The defendants, carrying on business as a hauling sub-contractor to Tri-Link, reported a cheque drawn on the plaintiff bank as lost. Tri-Link issued a replacement cheque. The first cheque was certified at a bank branch of the plaintiff in Alberta and deposited to the defendants' credit union account. Default judgments were obtained in January/March 1997 against the defendants who now sought to have them set aside pursuant to Queen's Bench Rules 346 and 173(a). The defendants claimed the statement of claim disclosed no cause of action as a certified cheque is irrevocable and as such any default judgment may be set aside ex debito justitiae, in which case delay in bringing the application is not factor. The plaintiff claims it has a cause of action in either conversion or mistake of fact/unjust enrichment. HELD: The defendants' motion was dismissed as the plaintiff's statement of claim adequately disclosed a cause of action in mistake of fact/unjust enrichment.  1)There are exceptions to the irrevocable nature of a certified cheque. The present case is one of those circumstances where the bank has an action in restitution against the holder of a certified cheque as payment did not satisfy a just debt. The defendants in this instance had already deposited the replacement cheque when the original cheque was presented for certification and subsequently deposited by the defendants. The cerified cheque did not satisfy a just debt. The defendants had already received payment for their services.  2)In recognizing exceptions to the irrevocable nature of certification the commercial utility of certification at the request of the payee is maintained while providing recourse to a bank where a payee seeks to unjustly enrich itself and then purport to seek refuge behind the 'irrevocable nature' of a certified cheque."
"FIAT. The plaintiff's lawyer applied for an order pursuant to the inherent jurisdiction of the Court or alternatively s.50 of the Queen's Bench Act for an ordered order requiring the plaintiff to be examined by a qualified psychiatrist within 30 days and requiring a report from the said psychiatrist as to whether the plaintiff is mentally competent to instruct his solicitor. The applicants recognized that if the plaintiff was found to be incompetent and the action was discontinued, or the defendants were successful in their defence, that they would be at risk of not being able to collect taxable costs against the plaintiff. HELD: The application was dismissed. The Court found that the application was another subterfuge and abuse of process to obtain evidence to support the original findings of incompetency to the benefit of the applicants in this law suit and to possibly obtain a new certificate of incompetencies. It would be inappropriate for the Court to order a single examination for determination of an issue where it would be unwise to act on a single recommendation. A certificate of incompetence issued pursuant to s.38.3 of the Act has the same effect as a finding that the person is incapable of instructing counsel or understanding the proceedings of trial for the simple reason that the issuance of a certificate would result in a litigation guardian being appointed.","FIAT. A defendant applied for an order pursuant to the inherent jurisdiction of the court, alternatively s.50 of the Queen's Bench Act, for an order requiring the plaintiff to be examined by a qualified psychiatrist within 30 days; requiring a report to be filed with the court as to whether the plaintiff is mentally competent to instruct his solicitor; and staying proceedings until a report is filed. The certificate of incompetence issued in December 1998 was revoked (QBG No. 690/1999) on the basis the competency examination was obtained by subterfuge (other parties had asked the plaintiff to attend a physical examination for a fictitious purpose but conducted a competency examination); there was no record of the review panel hearing; no reasons were given for the decision to uphold the certificate. The plaintiff alleged the issuance of the certificate caused mental anguish, emotional suffering, and loss of liberty and alleged conspiracy, abuse of process, breach of fiduciary duty and negligence. HELD: The application was dismissed.  1)Our civil procedure does not contemplate the trial of an issue on a person's competence to bring a lawsuit. A certificate of incompetence issued pursuant to the Act had the same effect as a finding that the person is incapable of instructing counsel or understanding legal proceedings and would result in the appointment of a litigation guardian. This step was not deemed necessary based on the evidence presented. A stay was refused.  2)Costs incurred in defending a civil action against a person who is subsequently found to be incapable of managing his or her estate are recoverable from the estate. 3)Queen's Bench Act s.50 did not apply.  4)The plaintiff was entitled to his costs in any event of the cause."
"The accused was charged with uttering a threat to cause death to his three children contrary to s. 264.1 of the Criminal Code. The accused had lived on a farm for 64 years and had a very bitter family fight. One of the children claimed that the accused had given him money to buy cattle. When the accused hung up the phone, the accused became so angry and his voice was so loud that he woke the baby granddaughter sleeping in the next room. The defence objected, arguing that the convictions were dated and highly prejudicial. HELD: The accused was found guilty of uttering the threat. The Court held that there was no need for the accused to formally make a Corbett application, requesting an order excluding evidence of convictions whose prejudicial effect outweighs their probative value. It was always open to the Accused to make Corbett applications and have ruling on it before electing to call evidence. In a non-jury trial, the Court should look charily at admitting such convictions or giving them any probative weight whatever. There is no need to draw a prima facie inference from the criminal record during a trial such as this one.","The accused was charged with uttering threats to his 77 year old mother to cause death to her and his brothers contrary to s.264.1 of the Criminal Code. HELD: The accused was found guilty. 1)The words spoken by the accused were clearly meant to be taken seriously and implied menace to the listeners. The accused's evidence was disbelieved. His constructed story did not 'hang together'.  2) In a non-jury trial there is ordinarily no need for defence to formally make a Corbett application, requesting an order excluding evidence of convictions whose prejudicial effect outweighs their probative value. The judge must not infer from the record that the accused has a propensity to commit criminal offences. Given the age of the record and other factors considered including his present work and family life, it was concluded that all of the prior convictions should be disregarded as they relate to the accused's credibility. The only conclusion drawn was that the accused had been familiar with the workings of the criminal justice system which was not a negative inference."
"The appellants brought a motion to admit fresh evidence, which if allowed, mandates a new trial. HELD: The Court allowed the application. The strictness of the due diligence requirement should be relaxed in light of the allegation of arson. Although the expert evidence of Mr. Jones was available, his counsel at trial failed to competently present this evidence on behalf of the appellants. The appellants also found that the proffered fresh evidence could have affected the result at trial, particularly with respect to the 'cause of the fire'.","The appellants sought to admit fresh evidence. HELD: 1)A new trial was ordered. The due diligence requirement was relaxed in light of the allegation of arson in the respondent's statement of defence. Although the expert evidence was available at trial, counsel failed to competently present the evidence. The fresh evidence could reasonably have affected the trial result respecting the cause of the fire.  2)The appellants were to pay party and party costs plus the respondent's cost of all proceedings in the Court of Appeal including preparation for the appeal taxed on double column V on or before July 15, 2000. In default of payment the appellant's claim may be struck."
"FIAT. An application to determine the issue of costs. The defendant sought to have the costs reduced because the plaintiff was unsuccessful in part of her claim. HELD: 1) The plaintiff's second counsel was experienced and the plaintiff requested that her costs be reduced. 2) The costs were determined based on either whether the plaintiff's first counsel was experience and capable of handling the case, or whether a second counsel fee should be taxed or allowed. 3) The expert medical evidence introduced by the plaintiff could only be recovered from either party. The costs should not be based on both hardship or the degree of success. The expert's fees must be reasonable; the witness testimony contribution to the case and relevant to the issues are the same. 4) The defendant would not permit the plaintiff to file medical practitioners' reports without calling the doctors for cross-examination purposes. The amount expended by party who obtains leave to call more than five expert witnesses to ensure that their testimony will assist the case. The plaintiff is entitled to recover $1,000 of the fees paid for expert medical reports but no part of the payment for locum tenens or his medical report. 5) The medical report charge was not recoverable from the defendant. 6) The expense of preparing the plaintiff’s report was not a reason to deprive her of costs as it was reasonably necessary to do so. 7) The expenses were determined by party to whom the plaintiff had been referred and taxed at 50 percent of the first counsel fee.","FIAT. The defendant sought to have costs reduced because the plaintiff was unsuccessful in part of her claim for damages for the injury to her ankle and resulting pain disorder when she fell after stepping on a metal plate bolted to the floor at the mall entrance of the defendant's store. The plaintiff was awarded $77,406.15 plus special damages and pre-judgment interest for a total of $120,540.43. The offer to settle for $75,000 plus taxable costs had been refused. The defendant argued the plaintiff's bill of costs should be taxed at 50% as she only received about 13 and 1/3% of the amount claimed; the costs were disproportionate to the judgment and the offer to settle, made in good faith, was never formally responded to. The plaintiff argued extensive witness costs were incurred because the defendant declined to agree to the filing of medical reports. At issue was whether the success of each affects the amount of costs to be awarded to either; the amount to be awarded for expert witnesses; and level at which a second counsel fee should be taxed or allowed. HELD: 1)Taxable costs should not be based on either hardship or the degree of success. Solely because recovery falls short of the amount claimed is not a reason to deprive a successful party of costs. Although costs are in the discretion of the Court, they usually go to the successful party. 2)It was appropriate in this case to reduce by 50% the plaintiff's costs taxable under column 4 since over half of the plaintiff's witnesses who were called to testify and most of the trial time was dedicated to the pain disorder claim, which proved only minor non-pecuniary damages. 3)A great deal of the plaintiff's expert medical evidence was of marginal value. Great care must be taken by a party who obtains leave to call more than five expert witnesses to ensure their testimony will assist the case. Expenses of each was examined separately. In some cases, medical report charges or consultation and preparation time were not recoverable from the defendant as not being of value or too exorbitant. 4)A second counsel fee was allowed at 50% of first counsel fee. A second counsel fee is in the discretion of the Court and is limited to two-thirds of the fee paid for first counsel. The amount at risk and complexity of the pain disorder claim justified second counsel in this case. Although one lawyer could have handled the trial without difficulty as there was considerable down time, that could not be known in advance. 5)Costs of the four pre-trial conferences, unspecified number of management pre-trial conferences, pre-trial brief, medical reports for doctors who were not called as witnesses are matters for consideration by the taxing officer rather than the Court. It was recommended that no fee should be considered when there is simply an adjournment because the pre-trial conference is premature; there is no tariff item for a pre-trial brief and in most cases is included in the attendance charge; a charge of $50 for each management pre-trial conference be allowed to a total limit of $500; costs of transcripts be recovered from the defendant. Costs payable by the plaintiff on an interlocutory application may be deducted from the plaintiff's Bill of Costs."
"The accused was charged with driving while disqualified contrary to s. 89(1) of the Highway Traffic Act. The accused indicated that the motor vehicle accident occurred at time when he was still believing that he had a valid provisional driver’s license. Pursuant to a letter from S.G.I. confirming that, as a result of a roadside suspension on December 18, 2005, his driver”s license was suspended until October 16, 2006 and until he had completed the required education or recovery program. Unfortunately, he had not received the letter until subsequent to the motor car accident in issue. HELD: The accused was acquitted. The Court applied the principles in McKenzie (P.N.) (1995), [1] and (R. v. Kraftchick), (2006), [2) to the accused. While not having heard from SG. I. in the interim, it was reasonable for the accused to rely on the advice received from the peace officer. The evidence was not sufficient to prove the accused had knowingly operated a motor vehicle while disqualified as alleged.","The accused was charged that he did drive while disqualified, contrary to s. 89(1) of The Highway Traffic Act, as it was then. The issues were as follows: 1) should the offence of driving while disqualified contrary to the provincial statute be regarded as a full mens rea offence? 2) is the evidence sufficiently credible for the court to conclude that the accused had knowingly operated a motor vehicle while subject to a driving disqualification? HELD: The accused is not guilty. 1) Driving while disqualified should be regarded as a full mens rea offence, rather than one of strict liability requiring the accused to establish due diligence on a balance of probabilities, given that the accused's liberty is jeopardized with the potential of incarceration. Likewise the automatic disqualification and surrender of a driver's license are serious sanctions. 2) The accused was adamant in asserting that he had no knowledge of his license suspension at the material time. Although he was not able to offer a compelling explanation for ignoring the admonition to him in a letter from Saskatchewan Government Insurance (S.G.I.) of July 11, 2005 that if he consumed any alcohol, an original driving suspension would be reinstated, the accused believed it was appropriate to rely instead on the advice of the peace officer on December 18, 2005 that it was only a 24 hour suspension, unless he heard further from S.G.I. Likewise, it did not appear that the accused had any further communication from S.G.I. subsequent to December 18, 2005, until shortly after the motor vehicle accident, roughly 2 months later. At that time, it was confirmed that the suspension had been extended to October 16, 2006, contrary to his earlier belief. Apparently it is an important part of the S.G.I. administration of driver's license suspensions that there be communication by letter, as has occurred here twice, with the purpose of attempting to ensure accused persons are advised in writing of changes in the legal status of their driving suspensions, with clarity and precision. As such, this accused should be able to rely on that procedure, even when that communication was not as timely as one would hope. Not having heard from S.G.I. in the interim, after December 18, 2005, it was reasonable for him to rely on the advice received from the peace officer. As such, the evidence is not sufficient to prove that the accused had knowingly operated a motor vehicle while disqualified as alleged, and he is not guilty."
"FIAT: The accused brought an application for a change of venue in this matter pursuant to s.599(1) of the Criminal Code. The accused seeks an order granting a trial in the City of Prince Albert or such other judicial centre as the Court deems appropriate. He also sought an order pursuant to the Youth Criminal Justice Act directing the Crown to disclose the names of any witnesses with criminal convictions registered under provisions of the Act, and particulars of the convictions. Crown counsel opposed the application. HELD: The application was denied. 1)A reasonably serene environment for trial is still possible in Saskatoon despite the fact that media reports regarding the offence and related acts of violence often referenced the victim and/or the incident giving rise to this trial. However, a properly instructed jury will be able to deal with the issues in the trial impartially and in accordance with the evidence presented, such that the accused will receive a fair trial. 2)Pre-trial publicity is not alone in allowing public bias to prejudice an accused's right to a fair and impartial trial. There are safeguards in place in the criminal justice system to prevent this from happening. 3)The Court reviewed the cases and found that there was no evidence of general prejudicial attitude or bias in the Saskatoon judicial centre. There was, however, some evidence that the applicant had not met the onus of proof necessary to succeed on this application.","FIAT: The accused applicant brings an application for a change in venue in this matter pursuant to s. 599(1) of the Criminal Code. HELD: 1). The application for a change of venue is denied. 2) There is no evidence of a general prejudicial attitude in Saskatoon as a whole that would justify a change in venue. There has been significant pre-trial publicity in this case from media reports of the case and other similar cases involving knives, as well as ongoing memorial reports. However, the accused has not met the onus necessary to succeed on its application. In other cases the existence of some memorial fundraising and memorials in the victim's names led the courts in those instances to grant a change in venue. However, in allowing the application, the courts in those cases both referenced the relatively small size of the judicial centers in which the trials were to be held, thereby making it more than likely an impartial jury pool could not be found. Saskatoon is not a small judicial centre. It is more populated than the Prince Albert judicial district to where the accused requests the case be transferred and is much larger than the judicial district of Humboldt, which might also be considered."
"FIAT: The applicants seek an interlocutory mandatory injunction preventing and restraining the respondent Board of Education from acting upon a resolution passed by the Board on May 7, 2007 that the Wilcox Public School be closed effective August 15, 2007. The grounds for the application are that the Board provided inadequate notice of an election for the Wilco school community council and it is alleged the election is nullity. As result there was no council for the Board to consult with as required by The Education Act, 1995. The court also notes that the respondent failed to comply with the requirements of procedural fairness in the manner in which they proceeded to pass the resolution closing the school. HELD: A preliminary review of the facts and law does not suggest a strong prima facie case. The application is dismissed.","FIAT: The applicants are residents of Wilcox and have children attending the Wilcox school. They seek an interlocutory mandatory injunction preventing the respondent Board of Education from acting upon a resolution that the Wilcox school be closed. HELD: Both with respect to the statutory breach of the 28-day notice period for the meeting to elect school community council members, and the ground of lack of procedural fairness, the Court concluded the applicants failed to meet the standard of a strong prima facie case. 1) A review of the facts and the law suggest that the applicant's submission on the fact that the notice for election of the school community council was 2 days short of the 28 days required by The Education Act does not meet the test of a strong prima facie case. The Act does not state that non-compliance with formalities will result in a nullity. There was no prejudice caused by the non-compliance with the 28-day notice period before the election of members to the school community council. There is no evidence or suggestion that a different school council would have been elected if the extra 2 days notice had been provided. No one complained at the time and the fact the matter is raised now amounts to a collateral attack on that election. The potential consequences of a Court finding of a nullity militate against such a finding. The relevance of the school community council in the closure of a school arises after the decision to close the school has been made. To nullify all of the process and consultation that went into the school closure on this collateral ground would have serious consequences of causing at least one year delay in the efficiencies or improvements in student education which motivated the decision, and result in a loss of time, energy and money expended in the process. 2) Taking into account the mandate of the Board under the Act with respect to school closures, the consultation process adopted by the Board, and the manner in which it conducted the consultation meetings does not lead to the conclusion the procedure was unfair. A review of the five factors identified by the Supreme Court in Baker v. Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration) does not favour an overly stringent application of the procedural fairness rules in this matter."
"FIAT: The plaintiff applies for orders requiring the defendant and third parties to answer questions and respond to undertakings arising from the examinations for discovery. The plaintiffs also ask for further and better disclosure of documents over which a claim for privilege is asserted and to identify documents which they object to produce by reason of claim of privilege. HELD: 1) The first order is for the defendant to provide the plaintiff with responses to two undertakings concerning the sale of cement.  2) The third parties are obligated to provide its responses to the undertakings before the examination for discovery of its proper officer is concluded so that he can be further examined on the responses. If the defendant revises the position set forth in its initial response based on after acquired information, it may file the questions and objections with the local registrar in whose office the proceedings are pending. The specific orders applied for in relation to each of the third parties will be addressed one at time.","FIAT: The plaintiff applies for orders requiring the defendant and third parties to answer questions and respond to undertakings arising from the examinations for discovery in this action pursuant to Rules 222, 231 and 232 of the Queen's Bench Rules and an order requiring the third parties to provide further and better disclosure of documents in their power pursuant to Rules 212 and 215. HELD: 1) A party to litigation cannot decline to answer questions on an examination for discovery that are intended to elicit the facts on which that party has based its pleading. A party is required to divulge the facts that it has now or admit that it has none if such is the case. The defendant is obligated to provide its responses to the undertakings before the examination for discovery of its proper officer is concluded so that he can be further examined on the responses. If the position of the defendant as set forth in those responses changes as a result of after acquired information, the defendant shall so inform the plaintiff by way of supplemental responses within 90 days following the completion of the defendant's examinations for discovery of the third parties. If it is necessary for the plaintiff to further examine for discovery on the defendant's responses or supplemental responses, the defendant's proper officer shall attend such examination for discovery. 2) The material filed satisfies the Court that PSAC documents relating to the PST issue are at least broadly relevant to the issues and that BJ Services likely has the power to obtain and produce them. The fact that BJ Services may intend to claim a litigation privilege over the documents, or that PSAC may not produce them, does not relieve BJ Services of the obligation to disclose their existence. BJ Services shall provide further and better disclosure of documents by providing a detailed list of documents referred to in the second part of the second schedule of its statement as to documents. If a claim for privilege is asserted over such documents, BJ Services shall identify the basis of such claim, the date of the documents, the name of the sender and the names of the recipients."
"The primary issue was the retroactivity of child maintenance for the period 2001 to 2007. Prior to the 2009 Consent Order, there was no written agreement or court order dealing with child maintenance. The respondent had made overtures to the applicant for increased child support several years prior to the separation, but had resisted such requests indicating lack of income to provide any additional amount. The applicant applied for relief pursuant to the Maintenance and Custody Act in October 2007. Consent Order dated January 9, 2009 provided relief to almost all of the issues raised in the proceeding, including ongoing child maintenance beginning January 4, 2008. What remains for decision is what responsibility, if any, the respondent has to retroactively provide child maintenance since the couple separated in August 2001 up to the end of 2007. The Court found that the respondent's dramatic increase in salary was sufficient notice his child maintenance obligation had to be increased and that his failure to provide income in accordance with the Guidelines should be corrected from the date of their separation. There is agreement as to the status of the child. The mother's request for a retroactive award with regard to the section 7 expenses is denied. The father has a responsibility to provide child support to the mother for the child beginning January 1, 2005 and ending January 31, 2008 and that he is in arrears with respect to this obligation in the amount of $9,833.00. The Nova Scotia Maintenance Enforcement Program will be in contact with the respondent to make arrangements as to repayment of arrearns. HELD: 1) The child is a son of the respondent and he has benefited from an adequate standard of living. He has provided for his son in a manner that is appropriate for his age. Given his knowledge that his obligation was equated to his income, he has provided effective notice that his current payment was deficient. This is not an isolated purchase and has happened quite often since the separation. Given that the parties' income has increased over the years, the Court finds that the applicant has 'effective notice' that the current payment is deficient. 2) The respondent has not made any effort to increase his monthly payment. The evidence does not support conclusion that the payor parent was pressured or intimidated by the applicant to the extent it would be reason for her to delay her application to seek formalized child support.","At issue was retroactive maintenance for the now 16-year-old for a period of time pre-dating the mother's application (in 2007). Although the parties separated in 2001, there was no written agreement/order in place until 2009. The father paid support voluntarily, at an amount that was increased over the years. The mother said the father controlled the amount and knew it was below his table obligation under the Guidelines. She claimed she did not know his true income, and that every time she asked for additional assistance (such as a contribution to extraordinary expenses) he told her he could not afford it. The father said he was unaware of the correct table amount, and that he paid according to the mother's demands. Retroactive support awarded according to the table amount from 2005 onward. The father's hardship arguments rejected. He was aware from the outset that his child support obligation was related to his income. The dramatic increase to his income, and his failure to disclose it to the mother in 2005 constituted sufficient/effective notice that his payments were now deficient. Claim for retroactive s. 7 (extraordinary or special) expenses for the same time-period denied. The father did, on occasion voluntarily contribute to these expenses. During the relevant period of time, the parents spent some time trying to reconcile and acting as a family."
"The Director of The Seizure of Criminal Property Act (the Act) seeks leave to appeal a Queen's Bench Chambers decision which denied his application for the forfeiture of vehicle registered to the respondent Cheryl Brinkman. The Director's application was brought pursuant to s. of the Act on the grounds that the vehicle had been used in criminal activity. HELD: Application dismissed.  1) With respect to issues (a) and (b), the Court was not persuaded that, in the context of this case, questions of evidence are of sufficient importance to engage the attention of the Court.  2) The Director was not at all sure that the Chambers judge overlooked the interests of the public or failed to consider the need to deter crime, undercut the profitability of crime and so forth. He conducted a relatively thorough review of the case law in the course of establishing the framework governing his decision-making.","HELD: The applicant’s first two grounds of appeal related to the evidence of the respondents’ and police. The Court of Appeal was not persuaded that questions of evidence were of sufficient importance to grant leave. The applicant’s third ground was that the Chambers judge failed to take into account the interests of the public, particularly, the need to deter the public and the need to remove profit from crime to compensate victims. The Court of Appeal did not grant leave on the third ground. The Chambers judge reviewed the relevant case law and did not fail to take those items into account. The last ground of appeal was the fact that the vehicle had already been held for 90 days. The Court of Appeal said that this ground did raise some interest but they were not convinced that this was the case to grant the leave to appeal."
"The agency applied for a long term order under s.37(3) of the Child and Family Services Act (the Act) but amended its application to now apply for an order that the current foster parents be declared as persons having a sufficient interest in all three children (under s.23 of the Act and s.35(1)(b)) and an order granting them custody. The children are identified by initials for the purposes of protecting their identity. HELD: 1)Each child is in need of protection pursuant to s.11(b). As the first option, that of returning the children to their parent, is unavailable, the question is whether or not a placement with the proposed persons of sufficient interest would be preferable to a temporary order in favour of the Minister. The current plan proposed by the agency is for each child to remain where they are on a temporary basis; better that they have the added stability of the order being sought. The revised plan is appropriate in these circumstances. The Agency is addressing the concerns of the parents, who fear that the father will not be able to care for the children. 2)It is important that the children continue to have sense of security in their placement, and continuity in their lives, both of which they will have if they remain in their current placement. The Father has not participated in these proceedings.","A Child and Family Services agency applied for an order: 1) declaring that the foster parents of three children have sufficient interest pursuant to s. 23 of The Child and Family Services Act; and 2) granting the foster parents custody pursuant to s. 37(1)(b). The children's mother was deceased and their father indicated that he was unable to meet his children's needs. The foster parents intended to continue to allow the father parenting time with the children. They also indicated that they would care for the children until each is 18 or until the order was terminated. The father consented to a draft order agreeing the children should be in the custody of the Minister and that he have reasonable access. The agency amended their application for the custody order to be made in favour of the foster parents rather than the Minister. HELD: The children were in need of protection pursuant to s. 11(b). The Court found that the agency's amended application was appropriate and preferred to a temporary order in favour of the Minister. Also, the Court noted that s. 39 allows for amendments of orders if circumstances change. The Court, therefore, ordered that the foster parents have custody even though the father only indicated his consent to the order in favour of the Minister. The agency was required to ensure that a copy of the written decision was personally served on the father."
"HELD: The court held that it could not resolve the custody issue between the parties as it was a matter of factly and expeditiously. The court found that the petitioner was a competent and loving mother. The child was also remarkably resilient in coping with the parent's separation and conflict. The petitioner had a traditional residence with two bedrooms, one for the petitioner and one for her children. The respondent was to have one bedroom, one bathroom and one bedroom with an additional bedroom. The parents' relationship was marked by domestic disharmony. The children were exposed to this throughout their lives. The Court found that both parents were capable of providing a stable and nurturing home for the child. The primary residence was in Moose Jaw, which is where the petitioner currently resides. The petitioner described herself as a stay at home mother. She described her role as a parent as being to watch the children while they were in school and to provide support and encouragement to the petitioner in the mother's role. The mother's assessment was high-handed and suggested some considerable negativity existed at the date of separation. The shared parenting regime has worked well while the petitioner is a pre-schooler. However, this coming September Madison will be five years old and will commence school on a regular basis. The inevitable decision as to where Madison will attend school is imminent.","The parties had a shared parenting arrangement since separation where each party parented their four-year-old child for equal times in a two-week cycle, the petitioner parenting in her home in Moose Jaw and the respondent parenting in his parent's home in Regina. The issue before the Court was to determine where the child should primarily reside and attend school. Each party saw the other as a competent and loving parent. The petitioner had another child, a half-brother to the parties' child, who was an infant at the time of the application. The petitioner was a stay-at-home mom on social assistance and the respondent was a student who worked part-time and lived with his parents. The respondent's parents were willing to assist the respondent financially and in the care of the child. The Court ordered custody/access report concluded that the child should primarily reside with the respondent, though the author noted that the decision was almost too close to make. HELD: The Court held that the best interests of the child would be best served by her primarily residing with the respondent and the parties having joint custody of the child. The Court first considered the quality of the child's relationship with each party and their families and concluded there was little difference between the parties but the child had a closer relationship with the respondent's extended family because she resided with them when she was with the respondent. The Court also determined that the child's economic needs could best be met residing with the respondent and his parents. The home environment of the respondent was found to outweigh that of the petitioner's. Further, the Court held that the child would have greater stability and continuity with the respondent, who has a concrete future plan. The petitioner's future plans were wavering and uncertain. The respondent was ordered to bear the responsibility for transporting the child to and from Moose Jaw and Regina. The respondent was also required to accommodate the petitioner and child by supporting Internet communications between them during the week, especially at bedtime. The petitioner was granted parenting time three consecutive weekends and the respondent on the fourth weekend. The second of the petitioner's weekends was extended to include another day as were any weekends with school or statutory holidays. The decision requires the child to miss one day of school every four weeks and the Court therefore left it to the parties to determine whether this can continue once the child begins grade two. The parties were ordered to each parent the child for half of Easter and Christmas breaks and they were to accommodate each other for Mother's and Father's Day each year. Further, the Court ordered that the child spend half of each summer holiday with each parent, suggesting that alternating weeks may be the best for the child, unless otherwise agreed to by the parties. Lastly, if the child has a school break longer than three clear days, the petitioner is to parent at least one-half of those days. The Court also urged the parties to collaborate and discuss the extra-curricular activities best suited for the child taking into account their affordability and disruption to the parenting arrangement."
HELD: The application was granted. The court found that: 1) a claim was made against the defendants based on the plaintiff's policy; 2) that the defendants conspired and combined amongst themselves to defraud and to injure the plaintiffs in order to delay or defeat the plaintiffs' obvious and substantial crop loss because of chemical spray drift; and 3) that each act was done by the defendant with a duty of good faith and in good faith towards the plaintiff. The defendant was obliged to defend the interests of the first defendants and to attempt to limit the plaintiffs’ liability; and 4) that there was no evidence that the plaintiff’s statement of claim disclosed any reasonable cause of action.,"Civil Procedure – Affidavits – Admissibility HELD: The Court could not locate any cases that suggested there was a duty to act fairly and in good faith by an insurance company because of an insurance policy where no claim was made against it. The Court found that it would be impossible for SMI to act fairly and in good faith to the plaintiffs and to concurrently act fairly and in good faith to the first defendants. SMI only had a duty to defend the first defendants pursuant to their policy of insurance. The Court noted the following in making its conclusion: 1) if SMI also had a duty to the plaintiffs, they could not use tactical or substantive errors of the plaintiffs to minimize their payment obligation. The insurer would not be able to vigorously defend the claim; and 2) the first defendant may be required to pay more if there was a duty by SMI to the plaintiffs. Many insurance policies have co-insurance provisions or require deductibles be paid by the insured. The Court held that the claim against SMI, and its employees and agents, had no reasonable chance of success. The Court also awarded costs against the plaintiffs for filing improper affidavit material. The improper material included information on settlement discussions."
"FIAT: The applicant/petitioner applies for a variation of an interim order issued by the Court in August 2007. The order was based upon the petitioner's income of $48,196 and the respondent's income $0. The parties agree that they have reasonable arrangements for the child's support. The applicant seeks an order from the Court terminating his obligations for payment based upon that the petitioner has not obtained employment of any significance since the order and the failure to diligently make and pursue an application for CPP disability benefits for which she may be eligible as required by the Order. HELD: The application is dismissed. The Court has dismissed the applicant's variation application. In the interests of avoiding multiple court proceedings in the future, the Court further orders the respondent to proceed to complete an application to split the CPP credits to the account of the applicant equally, the same to be supported by the applicant until Elizabeth receives her first degree. The application will remain in place until the child receives her First Degree. The respondent is prepared to fully support the applicant once her CPP claim is ruled upon.",HELD: The application was dismissed. The court found that the applicant had not proven that there was a material change in circumstances as voluntary early retirements do not constitute material change of circumstance. It ordered the respondent to immediately proceed to complete an application to split the applicant’s CPP credits.
"The appellant sought to overturn a conviction by the Provincial Court that he operated a motor vehicle while his ability to operate was impaired by alcohol and/or drugs contrary to s. 253(a) and s. 255 of the Criminal Code. HELD: Appeal dismissed. 1)Even if one could find merit in counsel's argument, which was not accepted and even if it was accepted, the trial judge could reasonably convict on the other evidence heidered.  2)The right of the Appeal Court to set aside a conviction on the evidence is set out in s. 613(1)(a) of the Code. It is agreed that counsel for the Crown knew nothing about the telephone call prior to hearing it from the witness at trial. Failure to disclose was not raised before the trialjudge. It should have been raised at the trial. 3)The appeal was dismissed.","The accused appealed his conviction by a Provincial Court Judge on a charge of impaired driving. The accused argued that the Crown had failed to make proper disclosure contrary to s.7 of the Charter and that the trial judge has misapplied the concept of reasonable doubt. HELD: Appeal dismissed. 1)The failure of the Crown to disclose was not raised at trial as it should have been. If the matter had been raised at trial and the judge then thought that the evidence not disclosed impacted the accused's defence, he could have adjourned the trial. 2)The evidence not disclosed would not have affected the accused's defence in any event. 3)On the issue of reasonable doubt, the trial judge could reasonably have convicted on the evidence, and the Court would therefore not substitute its own view of the evidence."
"This was an application to vary the terms of a consent judgment such that the applicant would havesole custody of his daughter from the Province of Saskatchewan. In the alternative the applicant sought an order preventing the respondent from removing their daughter from Saskatchewan. The parties separated in October 1994 and the daughter had been in the care of her mother since that time. The mother had been a stay-at-home mom and raised the daughter with the respondent. She indicated that she and the respondent had discussed the possibility of the applicant selling the furniture that she would not need and allowing the applicant to move back into the matrimonial home in exchange for car payments. The timing of the application raised the suspicion that it was the respondent's decision to sell the home that prompted this application. HELD: 1)The child had a close relationship with both parents, however that only scratched the surface in terms of the relationship between the two. The Court was not able to assess the effect of a disruption as a result of a change in custody or removal of the child from the community.  2)The respondent indicated that if there was an order made that the child not be removed from the jurisdiction until trial, she will not move to Kelowna.  3)The parties were unable to exercise their custody rights after the hearing of this motion. 4)The court was unable to determine whether the affidavits should be permitted on the basis of the motion filed.","An application to vary the terms of a 1995 consent judgment such that the applicant would have sole custody. Alternatively he sought an order preventing the mother from removing their daughter from Saskatchewan. The father obtained an ex parte order preventing the mother from removing the child from the province until the return date of the motion. The mother had always been the primary caregiver and had custody since the separation in 1994. The father had exercised regular and frequent access. She was given exclusive possession of the matrimonial home under the terms of the consent judgment which contemplated the home would be listed for sale and the net proceeds divided between the parties. Subsequent to the consent judgment the applicant went through bankruptcy proceedings in which he transferred his interest in the home to the trustee who then sold that interest to the respondent such that the applicant no longer had any interest in the home. HELD: 1)Relocation was neither foreseen nor reasonably contemplated by the judge making the original order. The threshold criteria was thus satisfied. 2)The trial of an issue was required as the matter could not be decided on the basis of affidavit evidence. The child had a close relationship with both parents. The disruption as a result of a change in custody or removal of the child from the community could not be assessed. 3)The applicant's request for interim relief was denied. If the mother proceeded with her move a revision of the access provision would be appropriate. 4)The child's best interest is the proper test to be applied (Cote) having regard to the factors identified by the Supreme Court of Canada in Gordon. 5)The applicant became aware in early June of the mother's intention to move to British Columbia and did not object. The timing of the application, a few weeks prior to the proposed move, raised the suspicion that it was the respondent's decision to sell the matrimonial home which prompted this application.  6)Costs were left to the trial judge."
"The applicants applied for an order of certiorari to quash a portion of an order dated January 5, 1998, which found that the applicants engaged in an unfair labour practice within the meaning of s.43 of the Trade Union Act by failing to provide the Union and Minister of Labour with notice of technological change. The respondent applied for a restraining order restraining the Labour Relations Board from requiring a rectification plan for violation of s43 of The Trade Union act or for making further remedial orders related to the said violation of ss. 43 of the Act. HELD: The Labour Relations board's decision was quashed. The matter was remitted back to the Labour Board to be dealt with having regard to the decision of the Board on the basis that the closure was not a technological change within the Meaning of s 43(1)(c) of the trade union Act. The Court ordered that the matter be remitted to the Board to deal with the application for an injunction.",The applicants applied for an order of certiorari to quash the portion of the order of the Labour Relations Board which found that the applicants engaged in an unfair labour practice within the meaning of s43 of the Trade Union Act by failing to provide the Union and Minister of Labour with notice of technological change. The applicants challenged the decision of the Labour Relations Board as being patently unreasonable and that the word removal as found in s43(1)(c) read separately or in conjunction with the remainer of the section could not reasonably be interpreted to include closure of a business or part thereof so as to constitute a technological change within the meaning of s43. HELD: The portion of the order which found that the applicants engaged in an unfair labour practice was quashed. The matter was remitted to the Labour Relations Board to be dealt with having regard to the finding that the closure of the vacuum division is not a 'technological change' within the meaning of s43(1)(c) of the Trade Union Act. 1)The Board made a patently unreasonable error. The issue had been settled by the decision in Regina Exhibition. Although this decision was now before the Court of Appeal the Court was bound by it. 2)It was not appropriate at this stage to deal with the application for an injunction.  3)The applicants were awarded one set of costs against the respondents.
FIAT. The accused sought an order for a judicial stay of proceedings pursuant to ss.24(1) and (2) of the Charter on the basis his right under s.11(b) to be tried within a reasonable time had been breached. Defence counsel took the position that at no point along the way did he waive delay and the delay of approximately 7 months which resulted from his desire to have a ruling made on the conflict of interest alleged was solely attributable to the Crown. The Crown did not share in the responsibility for this period of delay. Pre-charge delay was sufficient to raise the issue of conflict of interests. HELD: The application was dismissed. The Court found that the accused's right to a fair trial had not been adversely affected by the 7 month delay. The minor prejudice suffered by the accused was not caused by the delay. His right to privacy was not affected. 1)The delay was caused by factors beyond the expected and normal. The prejudice he experienced as a result of the defence counsel's application to remove the prosecution counsel was not prejudice. 2)The accused was on bail since shortly after his arrest. He agreed the delay had not resulted in a diminution of his ability to make full answer and defence. 3)There was no evidence as to the cause of the delay or how it affected his reputation. It was not for the court to decide how the motion would have been decided. It would not have been appropriate for the Court to go through the Morin analysis.,"FIAT. The accused, charged with trafficking in a narcotic, sought an order for a judicial stay of proceedings pursuant to s.24(1) and (2) of the Charter on the basis his right under s.11(b) to be tried within a reasonable time has been breached. HELD: The application was dismissed. The delay was not unreasonable.  1)The 25 months between when the charge was laid in May 1996 and the trial date in November 1998 was sufficiant delay to raise the issue of the reasonableness of the delay. Defence did not waive delay. 2)There was no reason given for the three and one-half month delay between the swearing of the information and the arrest. The accused's right to a fair trial had not been prejudiced by the total time delay. His right to security of person and to liberty were not affected. 3)Seven months delay was due to scheduling delays resulting from defence's application to remove prosecution counsel who had previously represented the accused. The Crown acted in good faith in opposing the application and had a meritorious position. 4)All other proceedings were within the systemic guidelines. 5)Prejudice to his liberty was minor as he was on bail since shortly after his arrest. He was able to make full answer and defence. He was employed throughout since his release. His inability to enter long term contracts or travel out of province would have existed for 21-1/2 months of the 25 month delay in any event. 6)Individual and family stress is to be expected. The minor prejudice beyond the normal and expected was not sufficient to outweigh society's interest in bringing those charged with criminal offences to trial."
"The Director of Assessment appealed a decision of the Nova Scotia Utility and Review Board. The board held that it had no jurisdiction to hear an assessment appeal because the taxpayer failed to serve notice on the clerk of the Municipality as required by s. 86(1) of the Assessment Act. The Director appealed the decision by filing notice of appeal with the board. He did not deny that the clerk had received a copy of the appeal notice. He took the position that the Board did not have jurisdiction, and that when such a waiver occurs, the failure to comply with the provisions for service do not constitute bar to the Board's hearing the appeal. The appeal was dismissed with costs to each of the respondents in the amount of Five Hundred Dollars plus disbursements to be paid by the appellant.","The appellant appealed a preliminary decision of the Nova Scotia Utility and Review Board which held that it had jurisdiction to hear an assessment appeal where, although the appellant failed to comply with the service requirement of s. 86(1) of the Assessment Act, the party not properly served waived the requirement. Dismissing the appeal with costs, that where the party that was not properly served expressly waived its right to notice as required by statute, the Board had jurisdiction to hear the appeal."
"The appellant body corporate, carrying on business under the name Atlantic Business Systems, agreed to provide materials and labour to build a home for the respondent in Sapporo. After the completion of the construction, the respondent commenced an action against the appellant in the Supreme Court alleging, inter alia, breach of contract and seeking possession of the third container. The appellant applied for an interlocutory recovery order. The prothonotary granted the order for security for costs and the appellant appealed. Allowing the appeal, that (1) an affidavit may contain statements as to belief of the deponent with respect to the sources and grounds thereof; and (2) unless the court otherwise orders, an affidavit used on trial shall contain only such facts as he can prove, with no indication of information and belief and paragraphs which intend to attack the credibility of the plaintiff with regard to the affidavit he supplied to the court in the process of getting the recovery order; or (3) documents contain substantial commentary, opinion and scandalous allegations irrelevant to the matters in issue on the application. The offending material so pervaded the affidavit was so fundamentally defective that the court should not be required to take it apart in pieces to preserve some possibly admissible material.","Respondent obtained ex parte recovery order. Appellant applied for the return of the property under Rules 48.06 and Rule 48.08. Its application was dismissed and the appellant appealed that order. Appeal dismissed. The affidavit material filed by the appellant in support of its application was so defective as to be not admissible.

"The grievor was a hotel employee who had been employed for ten years as front desk manager for the Delta Sydney hotel. She filed a grievance alleging that her work hours were reduced because another employee with greater departmental seniority returned from maternity leave. The arbitrator found that the hotel management had not intended to penalize her for working additional hours, but that the employee with the less hotel seniority would be the one who should have their hours reduced. The hotel applied for judicial review of the arbitrator's decision and sought to have it set aside under s.15(2) of the Arbitration Act. The appellant alleged that the wording of the collective agreement was wide enough to encompass the situation. She sought allotment of work hours based on her hotel position and recovery of her loss of loss of lost of wages. The respondent denied this application and argued that the interpretation of Article 9:01 could not reasonably be read into the language of that agreement and that it was patently unreasonable. Allowing the judicial review application, that the appeal is allowed on the basis that the portions of the agreement with respect to the hotel that were breached are set aside and the portions which were not breached are not set aside. The court also sought the court's intervention to determine the adequacy of the provision in the provision of privative clause provisions under the Trade Union Act and the Toronto City Board of Education v. O.S.T.F. District 15 et al. 1997 CanLII 378 (SCC), [1997] S.C.R. 487) as an appropriate remedy.","The grievor was employed in the front desk department of a hotel and her hours of work were reduced when another employee from the same department returned from maternity leave. The latter had greater departmental seniority than the grievor but less hotel seniority. The grievor filed a grievance claiming that under the collective agreement any such reduction of hours of individual employees should be based on hotel seniority, rather than departmental seniority. The arbitrator upheld the grievance and the hotel applied for judicial review. Application allowed; the arbitrator's interpretation of the collective agreement was patently unreasonable and her award should be set aside. The court's focus must be on the existence of a rational basis for the decision of the tribunal and not on whether it agrees with the decision. Although there was evidentiary support for the arbitrator's essential findings of fact, no logical process could be ascertained by which the final conclusion drawn from the evidentiary foundation was made."
"The accused, a 28 year member of the RCMP, failed to comply with a demand made to him by a Peace Officer pursuant to s. 254(3) of the Criminal Code requiring him to provide then or a soon thereafter as is practicable such samples of his breath as in the opinion of a qualified technician are necessary to enable a proper analysis to be made in order to determine the concentration, if any, of alcohol in his blood. HELD: The accused was found guilty.  1) On the evidence before the Court, it is not concluded that the accused's respiratory problems made it impossible for him to give a sample. The intoxilyzer did not register because he was not blowing properly into the mouthpiece. 2) The Court found that even though the accused was diligent in attempting to reach counsel and had not succeeded in obtaining a sample, his respiratory problems were not a reason to refuse. 3) The law is clear that if a person cannot provide a sample by reason of a medical condition that is a reasonable excuse. This does not mean that it must make it either extremely difficult or extremely painful for the accused to obtain a sample or involve some risk to his health. 4) An accused, who is aware of what triggers his anxiety attacks, for example a hard night of drinking the night before and continues to drink alcohol and operate a motor vehicle cannot be later heard to say and hope to avoid conviction, that the refusal was a result of a known medical condition.","The accused was charged with failure to comply with a demand to provide a breath sample contrary to s.254(5) of the Criminal Code. He argued that he had a reasonable excuse to refuse based on his medical condition of anxiety attacks at the time of blowing. HELD: 1)This case is similar to the Alberta Court of Appeal decision in Topp which stated the accused must not conceal his reasons for refusing to give breath samples. The case has to be decided on the basis of what the police knew or could readily surmise, not on the hidden facts, which the accused had not disclosed. The New Brunswick case of R. v. Dunnett canvassed the law with respect to s.10(b) rights and cited four factors arising from recent SCC decisions concerning detained or arrested person's right to a lawyer. Granted the accused was charged with refusal 51 minutes after the demand for the breath tests, even though he was diligent in attempting to reach counsel, he was not diligent in pursuing his rights after he unsuccessfully tried to contact a lawyer three times. It is not a police officer's obligation to go further if the accused does not appreciate the advice of Legal Aid counsel. 2)His evidence was not believed as to the anxiety attacks. The intoxilyzer did not register because he was not breathing properly into the mouthpiece. He provided an adequate supply of air in the roadside screening device about an hour prior. The statement of law enunciated in Pederson out of the Yukon Territory Supreme Court was adopted. It could not be concluded on the evidence that his respiratory problems made it impossible to provide a sample. The doctor stated he could do so when his breathing returned to normal as did the accused. Further an accused who is aware of what triggers his anxiety attacks, for example a hard night of drinking the night before, and continues to drink alcohol and operate a motor vehicle cannot be later heard to say and hope to avoid conviction that the refusal was a result of a known medical condition. He should not drink and drive."
"The respondent commenced an action for divorce against the respondent on the grounds that she was not aware of her entitlement to share in her husband's pension benefits at the time she entered into the agreement. The respondent also sought a division of assets under the Matrimonial Property Act. In the action, the respondent seeks to set aside the agreement made with the respondent and apply the equitable grounds of fraud, duress and unconscionability. HELD: The application was dismissed. The court had jurisdiction to vary the consent order under the circumstances as determined by the parties. There was no question that the respondent was entitled to commence the divorce action in Nova Scotia on the basis of the precondition. She was also entitled to the same relief the English Court of Chancery accorded to the plaintiff in Welding v. Sanderson. The only question remaining was whether the Nova Scotia court had the jurisdiction to hear the respondent's claim for divorce and her claim for division of property. A consent order is a contract and must be treated as such.","The applicant commenced a divorce action against her husband incorporating a claim for a division of assets under the Matrimonial Property Act. The Ontario Court had previously granted a consent order incorporating an agreement between the parties purporting to divide matrimonial assets. The applicant sought to set aside the agreement on the grounds of unconscionability, harshness or fraud. The court has jurisdiction to vary the agreement on the grounds alleged notwithstanding that the Act does not specifically provide the court with jurisdiction ."
"FIAT The father applied for an order pursuant to s. 29(1)(a) of The Children's Law Act finding the respondent in contempt of court for deliberately disobeying the terms of an access order for a son of the parties. He sought a fine and an order that the respondent bring the child to Saskatoon for access visits. The mother applied for a variation of the terms in the access order. She sought to restrict access to supervised visits in Manitoba. HELD: The application was allowed. The order was denied. The court found that the mother was in contempt and ordered to purge her contempt by paying solicitor and client costs fixed at $1,500 and by obeying access terms of this order. The limited access proposal of the respondent was not realistic because it virtually guarantees that the petitioner and his parents will never be able to develop any relationship with his son, child that the father has been supporting financially on a voluntary basis since birth. Nor was the access proposal realistic because the respondent did not have the financial ability to bring the Child to Saskat for access. The Court awarded solicitor and clients costs fixed as $1k, $60 per month as partial reimbursement of those costs. The August 2002 order was vacated.","FIAT.

The Court raised jurisdiction, service and time issues.HELD: 1)To avoid adjournment counsel consented to the court's jurisdiction, the acknowledgement of service and the abridgement of time. 2)The mother was found to be in contempt of court for deliberately disobeying the order by repeatedly refusing, without lawful excuse, to comply with its terms. Almost without exception she refused to make the child available for the bi-weekly supervised access visits. She did not abduct the child.

"The mother, who lives with the maternal grandmother, plans to have the child placed in the permanent care and custody of the paternal grandmother, who will be responsible for the child's nutrition and physical well-being. The father, V.M., is a convicted child abuser whose name appears on the Child Abuse Register, having been sentenced to thirty-nine months in prison as a result of his conviction. His access to his son is by court order, supervised only, but there was evidence he had the care of his own son in an unsupervised situation. The mother is 66 years old and lives with her sister. The parties agree that the child is in need of protective services. Evidence used at the protection hearing was not disputed. However, it was clear neither party was willing to work with assistance towards learning sufficient parenting skills to take care of the child. An order will issue under the Maintenance and Custody Act granting custody to the grandmother who will facilitate access to the child and be required to facilitate access amongst the various parties, some of which will be supervised within her discretion.","The mother was unable to care for the child and the father, who had been convicted of sexual assault, was only entitled to supervised access. Both the paternal and maternal grandmothers presented plans of care to the court, with the paternal grandmother seeking custody and the maternal grandmother seeking care and control of the child. The child had a younger sibling who was in the maternal grandmother's custody and her daughter, the mother of the child, supported the plan of the maternal grandmother. The Agency supported the paternal grandmother. Custody granted to the paternal grandmother with reasonable access to the maternal grandmother and supervised access to the parents. The paternal grandmother was better able to care for the child financially and her circumstances were such that it was in the child's best interests to grant her custody. The issue of separation of siblings was only one factor in considering an alternative (relative) placement; the children were very young and there was no evidence of a bond between them."
The plaintiff filed a claim against the defendants for breach of contract and general damages and exemplary damages. The defendants counterclaimed for additional rent and unpaid business taxes for 1992. At pretrial conference it became clear that there was an application by the plaintiff to add or substitute another plaintiff and to seek relief from the provisions of the Limitation of Actions Act. HELD: The plaintiff's application was dismissed. The court found that the delay in this case was full nine years after the cause of action arose. The plaintiff had not sought or received any legal advice during this time period as she had not responded to requests for advice respecting the matter. The delay was also a presumption that the evidence would be less cogent than it otherwise would have been. As the plaintiff had acted neither promptly nor reasonably by'sitting on her rights' for nine years.,"The plaintiff brought an action against the defendants for breach of contract in regard to the defendants' refusal to return to her the substantial security deposit that she paid as part of a motel lease. After being clearly told that the money would not be returned, she waited 9 years before commencing the action. The plaintiff applied for an order disallowing the defendants' limitation defence. Application to disallow the limitation defence dismissed; plaintiff's action dismissed. The plaintiff's evidence did not show any valid reason for such a lengthy delay and the defendants thought that all outstanding issues with the plaintiff had long since been settled. Not only was there a presumption that the evidence would now be less cogent than it would have been, but the defendants' storage warehouse was destroyed by fire 3 years ago resulting in the loss of many old records, including those relating to the motel."
"The petitioner sought a divorce and custody, child support and an order directing that the respondent's equity in the matrimonial home be postponed until the youngest child was 19 years old. The respondent sought to sell the home and build a new house and claimed that he was entitled because he stayed home and cared for the children throughout the marriage and lost his opportunity to enter the work force earlier. HELD: The court ordered the respondent to pay child support of $25,000 per year, with the exception of $1,400 for one child, and that the parties should have regular monthly expenses of $30,000 to $35,000. The court was not able to find any special or extraordinary expenses for the respondent. The parties' relationship was strained and the court was unable to find an appropriate solution.","The wife sought a divorce, custody, child support, a division of matrimonial assets and an order directing that the husband's equity in the matrimonial home be postponed until the youngest child reached 19 years of age.

HELD: The application was dismissed with costs to the applicant to be brought on that basis.  1)The applicant had arrived at the conclusion that the two claims did not arise in the same time frame but were separated by a minimum of 120 days being the disability qualification period under the disability plan. 2)The limitation period was not set aside and the applicant was allowed to bring her amendments within 30 days of the deadline to bring this application.  3)The amendments sought were allowed in respect of the applicant's existing claim alleging breach of contract of disability insurance and her application to make S.A.H.O. a party to the action for the benefit of her 65-year-old disability pension.  4)The Court dismissed the application to substitute the amendments.","FIAT: The applicant's motion seeks to amend the statement of claim dated December 31, 1999 in which she alleges wrongful dismissal by her employer on January 10, 1994. The purpose of the amendment is to join the Saskatchewan Association of Health Organizations (SAHO) to the action. The applicant seeks to make SAHO a party for the purpose of claiming from it a disability pension from the date of her termination until she turned 65 on July 29, 2000. HELD: The application to join SAHO is dismissed. The claims do not arise in the same time frame but are separated by a minimum of 120 days being the disability period under the disability plan. There is no connection between the two claims. The existing claim alleges a breach of contract of employment. The claim proposed against SAHO alleges a breach of a contract of disability insurance. There are no common facts. The facts relevant to the breach of contract of employment are the applicant's performance on the job and the actions of the employer. The facts relevant to the disability claim are the applicant's health commencing at least 120 days after her employment terminated."
"The accused was convicted of aggravated assault for wounding his sister. The Crown applied pursuant to s. 753(1) of the Criminal Code to have the accused designated a dangerous offender. The defence position was that the accused should be designated a long-term offender. HELD: The Court held that the Court must now consider whether the Crown has established beyond reasonable doubt that the offender is 'dangerous offender' and must be sentenced to indeterminate detention. The Court sought to review the applicable law at the outset, given that there were significant amendments to Part XXIV of the Code in 1997 which have been interpreted by both the Supreme Court of Canada and the Court of Appeal, and given the unusual nature of this sentencing procedure. These cases all involved trial court decisions which pre-dated Johnson. The standard is not whether cure is guaranteed but whether there is a reasonable possibility of eventual control in the community. There must be more than an expression of hope that the person can be treated, but we must not require an absolute guarantee of treatability.","The Crown has applied pursuant to s. 753 of the Criminal Code to have the accused designated a dangerous offender. There is no question that the accused was convicted of a 'serious personal injury offence' as that term is defined in s. 752 of the Code. It is also clear that the accused's predicate offence and past behaviour lead to the conclusion that the requirements set out in s. 753(1) of the Code have been met. The sole issue left for the Court to determine is whether the evidence permits the Court to find that there is a reasonable possibility of eventual control of the risk the accused poses to the community so that he could be designated a long term offender rather than a dangerous offender. This is not a case where a definite term of imprisonment would be appropriate, as was conceded by defence counsel. HELD: The accused is a dangerous offender. He is sentenced to indeterminate detention. 1) The accused does not have significant gaps in his violent offending, except for one period of about 19 months beginning August 2000. While there is a significant time period between his offences concerning T.R. (1993) and those involving P.M. (2003) there are also the other violent offences concerning women which are of concern, both with respect to MZ, which is a third example of that type of controlling, violent behaviour and the incidents concerning F.B. and S.O. which denote more explosive violent behaviour. 2) The expert evidence supports a finding that the accused is not someone who can be treated so as to reduce the risk of re-offence he presents to the community to an acceptable level.  3) Although many of the accused's offences were committed while he was under the influence of drugs or alcohol, it is doubtful that the continuous beatings which he inflicted on his domestic partners can all be attributed to violence while under the influence of substances. 4) The accused does not pose a risk to just a single person. Any woman he has contact with either through family relationships, intimate relationships, or purely social relationships is at risk of his penchant to punch or kick them in the face. Those he is involved with in a domestic situation or intimate relationship are at grave risk of his controlling, violent and torture-like abusing behaviour over a lengthy period of time. It is unlikely that restrictions in his living arrangements would be effective in preventing him from being intimately involved with women, who would be at risk. 5) The Court was of the opinion that the accused has significant psychopathic features of his personality that are so entrenched as to be impervious to change such that the sentencing principle of public protection can only be achieved by an indeterminate sentence."
"The father petitions for sole custody of his 7 year old daughter, while each of her father, mother and maternal grandmother independently seek joint custody with the father. Hayley's mother seeks to be designated as her daughter's primary caregiver. HELD: 1) Hayley is seven years old. Since the commencement of these proceedings, each of the parties and their extended families have chosen to relocate from the City of Moose Jaw. The Court has no other facts before it relating to the physical aspect of where Hayley might reside or go to school if she moves with her father to the city of Calgary.  2) The mother testified that she and her father had agreed that she would be the homemaker for the foreseeable future. It is clear that this child is slower, but the same cannot be said about the opportunity to earn a living in Moose Jaw other than the fact that she is the eldest of the five children at the time of this child's birth. This child is the product of tumultuous relationships between father and daughter. The mother's relationship with her daughter has not been fostered in a meaningful way. The father has had no effective communications with either of the respondents, J. O. or C. H., and information is generally passed through his wife or through his own mother and on to himself. 3) There is no evidence as to how the mother would parent the child should be placed in the custody of the child. It would be unfair and unjust to place the child in the hands of her biological father and require him to assume a more traditional and secondary role in the child's life.","Hayley is 7 years old. In this application each of her father, mother and maternal grandmother compete for some form of custody over her. The father seeks sole custody. The mother and grandmother seek joint custody with the father. The mother seeks to be designated as her daughter's primary caregiver. HELD: 1) The father and his wife Patricia have been the primary caregivers and psychological parents of Hayley for in excess of 2 years. The preservation of that important relationship when added to all other factors in this case tips the scales in favour of the father. 2) The family which has been Hayley's experience for the past 2 years, even if relocated to Calgary, is where the continuity, consistency and stability necessary to attain Hayley's best interests will be found. 3) The father must be the sole custodian of Hayley. He must consult with her mother. The evidence shows that the parties have not been able to maintain a functional parental relationship. Whether the mother establishes a new residence in Moose Jaw or Cold Lake, the distance relative to Calgary is significant. 4) A grandparent may be a person of sufficient interest if the relationship leads to the conclusion that such a relationship is beneficial to the child and consequently harmful if terminated. That is the first step. The second step arises only where the grandparent is found to be a person of sufficient interest. It proceeds with a review based on the best interest principle as enunciated by s. 9(1) of the Act. 5) The court was satisfied that the grandmother is a person of sufficient interest in Hayley's life and that if her relationship as grandmother to Hayley was thwarted by the actions of Hayley's parents, the result to Hayley would be harmful. There are situations, and this is one of them, where the court should curtail the tradition of access to a grandchild flowing from the parents who have the right to control the upbringing of their child and to determine what relationships the child shall be a party to. An independent right of access is needed to attain Hayley's best interests. The history and intensity of Hayley's relationship with her maternal grandmother weighs in favour of specifying access."
"The plaintiffs applied for an order compelling the defendant to respond to written interrogatories; an order permitting further oral examination for discovery of the plaintiff on issues arising from his responses to the written interrogations; and an order directing him to provide a copy of the report of neurologist Dr. Vrbancic. HELD: The application was adjourned sine die. An order pursuant to Rule 173 of The Queen's Bench Rules requiring the plaintiffs to provide further and better particulars of their claim as set out in the Demand for Particulars dated November 28, 2005 and an additional order requiring them to provide additional particulars as well as undertaking responses.  1) The plaintiffs did not have a cause of action for aggravated or punitive damages. Nor could it be said when assessing the merits of the considerable allegations that have been made that claim for aggravated and punitive damages is scandalous, frivolous or vexatious. 2) It would be somewhat presumptuous at this stage of the proceedings to conclude that it is plain and obvious pursuant to rule 173(a) of the Queen’s Bench Rules that the plaintiffs do not Have a Cause of Action. Rather, it is the position of the plaintiffs that they require particulars of reviews and inquiries in order to determine the level of skill of Dr. Graham in performing laparoscopic gynecological surgery. His performances both before and after the surgery performed on the plaintiff, Lisa Dawson, they claim, are relevant to that issue.  3) The Court was limited to looking at the claim and particulars provided, if any, when deciding whether to strike paragraphs. 4) Counsel would not agree to allowing further examination. The plaintiffs were not required to reply to any undertakings or requests for further particulars.  5) The Rule 173(c) of The Queens Bench Rules allows a party to proceeding, without order, to examine for discovery, before trial, an adverse party touching matters in issue. Such an order would be contrary to the statute and violate the plaintiff's duty to provide the plaintiff with full particulars of the claim.  6) The claim was dismissed with costs.","FIAT: The plaintiffs apply for an order requiring the defendant doctor to answer the interrogatories and attend a further examination for discovery. The defendants seek an order striking portions of the statement of claim, and requiring the plaintiff to provide answers to undertakings given at his examination for discovery. HELD: 1) Rule 222 of The Queen's Bench Rules allows a party to a proceeding without order to examine for discovery, before trial, an adverse party touching matters at issue. If the plaintiffs are in effect seeking to obtain particulars of similar fact circumstances, the prejudicial effect of such evidence far outweighs any prohibitive value. At the same time, s. 60(2) of The Medical Profession Act, 1981 protects against disclosure of information or evidence given during proceedings conducted by the College of Physicians and Surgeons. Likewise, s. 35.1 of The Saskatchewan Medical Evidence Act grants a similar privilege relating to quality assurance committees that have evaluated care given to patients in hospitals. Insofar as the interrogatories relate to patients, surgical procedures or proceedings not related to the subject litigation, they are either not relevant or privileged. Since the statement of claim has twice been amended, the court was satisfied that special circumstances exist permitting further examination for discovery and/or interrogatories. Wide latitude is permitted at this stage of the proceedings. The trial judge will be in the best position to determine the admissibility of information obtained in relation to the doctor's skills, techniques, judgment and competency. The plaintiffs are entitled to responses to specific interrogatories. If further elaboration is required, the plaintiffs may at their own expense re-examine the doctor. Such examination should not include inquiries as to other patient names, hospitals involved or details of the surgical procedures or surgeries performed.  2) Pursuant to Rule 173(a) of the Rules of Court it must be plain and obvious that the paragraphs of the statement of claim disclose no reasonable cause of action. Punitive damages are awarded in situations where the defendant's misconduct is so malicious, oppressive and high-handed that it offends the court's sense of decency. Such damages are only awarded where the combined award of general and aggravated damages are insufficient to achieve punishment and deterrence. The defendant's misconduct does not have to be an independent actionable wrong to attract punitive damages. The breach of a duty that is owed will attract an award of punitive damages. It is not the degree of negligence but the mental element that accompanies the negligence that give rise to a claim for aggravated or punitive damages. The amended statement of claim alleges the doctor failed to inform one of the plaintiff of the risks associated with the surgery leading her to believe there were no risks involved. Such negligence, if proven, could lead a trier of fact to conclude that both aggravated and punitive damages are warranted against this doctor. It would be somewhat presumptuous at this stage to conclude that it is plain and obvious that the plaintiffs do not have a cause of action for aggravated or punitive damages against the doctor. In the courts view humiliation, indignity, degradation or shame could be the consequences of the wrongful behaviour pleaded. If those emotions must be specifically pleaded, the plaintiffs can apply for a further amendment of their claim. 3) The obligations of a party to comply with undertakings given at an examination for discovery are contained in Rule 231 of The Queen's Bench Rules. To the extent that the doctor has been required to respond to interrogatories relating to his skill and training and to the extent that any further cross-examination may show defects in his competency, the plaintiff's undertaking must be answered. If the plaintiffs have further or other facts, those facts must be provided. 4) The defendants are not entitled to know or to take advantage of or receive any credit for or accounting relating to trust funds gratuitously set up for the plaintiff. However, an accounting regarding the bank records and the records produced for the Public Trustee by the Trustee for the trust fund will be complied with as it may impact on the claim by him for loss of income as a result of being required to be in attendance to provide care for the plaintiff."
"HELD: The application was dismissed. The court found that s. 20 of The Limitations Act applied because no limitation period expired after the original claim was commenced and before the claim was amended to add Saskatchewan as a defendant. As well, a number of plaintiffs' claims were prima facie statute-barred. They could either apply for orders determining that no time limitation period applies or allowing the claims to be brought. In either case, the applications must satisfy the applicable legislation and the Rules of Court.","FIAT: The plaintiffs are former students of a school at Ile a La Crosse, Saskatchewan. They commenced this proposed class action against the Attorney General of Canada (the Government) in December 2005. In January 2007 the plaintiffs' counsel filed an amended statement of claim which added the Government of Saskatchewan (Saskatchewan) as a second defendant. Saskatchewan applies for an order pursuant to Rule 166 and 168 of the Queen's Bench Rules disallowing the amendments to the statement of claim. The amended claim alleges that the Government and Saskatchewan funded and were responsible for the school in a supervisory and oversight capacity and that they are liable to the plaintiffs for physical and sexual abuse, loss of language and culture, failing to provide an adequate education and holding them against their will and the will of their parents. HELD: 1) This application is based on the proposition that s. 20 of The Limitations Act applies to the plaintiffs' amended claim. However, s. 20 does not apply because no limitation period expired after the original claim was commenced and before the claim was amended to add Saskatchewan as a defendant. Section 19 of The Limitations Act applies to the original and the amended claims. The application is dismissed. 2) Accepting the pleadings as true, a number of the plaintiffs' claims are prima facie statute-barred. The plaintiff may choose to apply for orders determining that no time limitation period applies or allowing the claims to be brought. Alternatively, the defendants may apply for orders determining that some or all of the claims are statute-barred. In either case, the applications must satisfy the applicable legislation and the Rules of Court."
"FIAT The petitioner applies to vary the consent parenting judgment and the consent child support order. The parties were the parents of twins, born August 28, 2005. The petitioner went on maternity leave from her position at the Calder Centre in Saskatoon. She then relocated to Regina to be with her family where the children were born. The respondent as single parent was able to access family supports after the twins were born in Regina. HELD: The application is dismissed. 1) There has not been a material change of circumstance with regard to the petitioner's increased costs as a result of the shared parenting arrangement. However, there is some evidence that the petitioner has not worked well with the support system as it was not set out in the original parenting judgment. 2) The petitioner has failed to meet the onus upon him to establish that a material changed of circumstance has occurred. The original judgment contemplated in detail the parenting arrangement that was followed. The parenting judgment provided that when an equal parenting arrangement occurred, the petitioner would continue to provide basic Guidelines maintenance as he currently does, with no deduction based on increased parenting time.","The petitioner and respondent are the parents of twins. The petitioner father sought variation of a consent order. The consent order provided that the parties would have joint custody of the children with the primary residence with the respondent. The order also provided that the respondent would have the final decision with respect to health and education matters, after consultation with the petitioner. The situation had evolved to the point that the petitioner had relocated to the same city as the respondent and children. For the past two and a half year, the petitioner had access to the children 50% of the time. The petitioner acknowledged that under the current arrangement, the respondent consulted him before making decisions regarding the welfare of the children. The consent order dealt with child support payable, provided that tax returns be exchanged annually and set out how child support should be calculated on an ongoing basis. The petitioner sought to have the child support arrangement varied so that his support obligation would not increase or decrease in the years to come. The petitioner cited increased personal costs to exercise access to the children. HELD: The petitioner had not established a material change in circumstances sufficient to justify a change to the parenting arrangement. The original consent order provides that the respondent must consult with the petitioner on issues of health and education and the current arrangement has worked well for the children. The petitioner also failed to establish a material change in circumstances sufficient to alter the agreed child support arrangement. The issue of increased costs for the petitioner to exercise access to the children was dealt with in the original consent order. The only change in circumstances is that the petitioner's income has increased. The petitioner's application to vary the parenting arrangement and child support order was dismissed. The respondent was awarded costs."
"The landlord appeals a decision of a Hearing Officer of the Office of the Residential Tenancies, which decision ordered the landlord to pay the tenant $787.13, of which $562.13 represents utilities that the Hearing Officer found the tenant had overpaid and $225 which was ordered to be paid as abatement of rent for the tenant's inconvenience of having to deal with the caretaker's threats of the water being turned off and for repeated notes from the caretakers. The landlord also appeals the decision of the hearing officer. HELD: The Court is statutorily restricted to addressing questions of law or of jurisdiction. This function means that where there is some relevant evidence to support a finding of fact, that finding may not be disturbed on appeal. Only when there is no relevant supporting evidence is the line between valid and invalid appealable finding crossed.

It is not open to this court to overturn those findings of fact. The appeal is dismissed."
"The defendant applied for an order sealing the affidavits of two young persons. Counsel for the plaintiffs and the defendant granted leave to speak to the matter. The defendant submits that the young persons were victims of a brutal hazing assault conducted by senior students, including the plaintiffs. The plaintiff seeks costs. HELD: The order is at the top of the range of protections which the court may afford to individuals in our society and the onus is on the applicant to establish on a continuing basis that this remedy is required. The affidavits contain significant personal injury and psychological harm to the plaintiffs, their families and others. The assaults and related proceedings have already generated strong emotions on all sides. Any further publicity of the allegations made by the defendants can only serve to aggravate the controversy and detract from the education and well-being of the student body as whole. The Court refers to the two part test set out by the Supreme Court of Canada in Dagenais (1994 CanLII 39), [1994] S.C.C.; and R. v. Mentuck, 2001 S.D. 442 (CanLII), to determine whether restrictive publication should be ordered: the necessity to prevent serious risk to the proper administration of justice because reasonable alternative measures will not prevent the risk; and, the positive effects of the rights and interests of the parties and public, including those of the right to free expression. Bearing in mind the efficacy of the high school grapevine in this electronic age, publication of the factual accounts of the young person in their affidavits will not cause further harm to them in the view of the court. The public, especially fellow students of the Young Persons, have the right of know their version of the facts. However, other portions of the affidavit speak to effects of their assault on the two young people and ramifications to others should be sealed since there is a real and serious risk of further harm. The Supreme Court refers specifically to Dagenaises v. Canadian Broadcasting Corp., 1994 CanLii 39 (SCC), [94] SCC 76 and R v. mentuck, 2000 SCC 77 (CanlII), [2001] SBC 76. The two part tests set out in Dageneis are: the necessary to prevent a serious risk, the proper maintenance of justice; reasonable alternative means will not succeed; and the positive effect of the law and the right on the rights of the Parties and public","The defendant applied for an order sealing the affidavits of two young people who were the victims of a brutal hazing assault conducted at a high school by senior students, including the plaintiffs. The defendant argued that public disclosure of the affidavits would exacerbate the harm that was done to the young people.

"The accused was charged with operating a motor vehicle while his blood alcohol content exceeded 80 milligrams of alcohol in 100 millilitres of blood, contrary to s. 253(1)(b) of the Criminal Code. After being detained at the police station, the accused attempted to reach three different lawyers but ultimately spoke with Legal Aid duty counsel. The accused argued that the officer's grounds for making the demand were not made forthwith and that his s. 10(b) Charter rights were not breached. HELD: The accused was arbitrarily detained for 11 minutes and a sample of his breath was obtained. The admission of the Certificate of Analysis would not bring the administration of justice into disrepute. The Court found that the accused's Charter right to be secure against unreasonable search and seizure was violated. The Certificate of Analyses would not be excluded.  1) It is the Court's view that Charter breaches were moderately serious and the accused was not given an opportunity to exercise his right to counsel provided for in s. 254(2). However, the officer appeared to have acted in good faith. The officer placed the accused in the police vehicle because he was investigating a possible drunk driving charge, but also because it was cold outside and he had no jacket on, he was injured and his vehicle was seriously damaged. 2) There is no rule with respect to the exact number of minutes which must elapse before the demand is made. 3) The Court finds that the delay of 11 minutes can be attributed largely to waiting for the ASD to arrive. The officers knowing the accused had not reached either of their office numbers, took no steps to provide the accused with their after-hours contact numbers or obtain their home numbers. 4) In R. v. Rilling, the Court found there is a range in the potential impact upon an accused, fromfleeting and technical to profoundly invasive. The more serious the effect of the breach, the greater the risk that the admission of a breath sample must be taken 'forthwith'. The accused's right to consult counsel is suspended upon a demand to provide sample of breath. 5) The certificate of analysis is admitted into evidence.","The accused was detained by a police officer at the scene following a motor vehicle accident. The police vehicle was not equipped with an approved screening device (ASD) and was requested at 3:02 a.m. Upon receiving the ASD, a demand was made for a breath sample at 3:10 a.m. and a 'fail' reading was obtained at 3:12 a.m. The accused unsuccessfully attempted to reach three different lawyers at the police station and ultimately spoke with Legal Aid duty counsel. The accused was charged with driving over .08. The defence argued that the ASD demand was not made forthwith and the ASD results were unlawfully obtained. The defence submitted the accused's rights under s. 8, s. 9, and s. 10(b) of the Charter were breached and sought exclusion of the Certificate of Analysis. HELD: 1) The accused's s. 10(b) Charter right was not infringed. While the police were obliged to afford the accused a reasonable opportunity to contact counsel and to facilitate that contact, they were not required to monitor the quality of the legal advice once contact was made. 2) Although the accused was arbitrarily detained for a period of 11 minutes from time of detention to making of the ASD demand contrary to s. 8 and s. 9 of the Charter, the officer acted in good faith by placing the accused in the police vehicle because it was cold outside, the accused had no jacket on, he was injured and his vehicle was seriously damaged. The detention was of relatively short duration and there was no evidence that the accused's bodily integrity or dignity were compromised. The admission of the Certificate of Analysis would not bring the administration of justice into disrepute."
"The Crown appeals the acquittal of the accused on a charge of carrying a concealed weapon contrary to s. 90 of the Criminal Code. The Crown appeals on the grounds that the learned trial judge misapprehended the evidence, ignored other evidence and improperly admitted opinion evidence. The accused submits that the verdict was unreasonable and not supported by the evidence and seeks conviction on the charge. HELD: The Crown's appeal is dismissed. 1) The Crown argues that the sword should have been found by the trial judge to be a prima facie weapon in the same manner that a firearm, or brass knuckles or other inherently dangerous items are considered weapons. The only evidence before the trial court was that the accused probably bought it as a decorative item and (b) that it likely came from a novelty store. On this basis the learned judge concluded that she had a reasonable doubt that the blade was designed to be used as a weapon. 2) The trial judge properly placed the accused's evidence in the context of the issues she had to address. The appeal is allowed.","The Crown appealed the acquittal of the accused on a charge under s. 90 of the Criminal Code for carrying a concealed weapon. The accused was spotted at a recycling facility with a sword stuffed in the back of his pants. At trial, defence called evidence suggesting that a sword of that type could be purchased at a novelty store and had a blunt edge. The accused testified that he bought the sword with the intention of hanging it on the wall or putting it on his television. The trial judge found that the Crown had not established that the sword was a weapon or that the accused intended to use it as a weapon. The Crown appealed on the basis that the trial judge misapprehended evidence, ignored other evidence and improperly admitted opinion evidence. HELD: The evidence from the defence 'expert' indicated that he had particular experience that allowed him to recognize the sword and he was able to be of assistance to the Court because of his experience. No attempt was made by the Crown to contradict the evidence that the sword could be purchased at a novelty store and had a blunt edge. The Crown bore the burden of establishing that the sword was a weapon within s. 2 of the Criminal Code and the only evidence before the Court was that the accused probably bought it as a decorative item and that it likely came from a novelty store. On that basis, it was open to the trial judge to conclude that she had a reasonable doubt that the sword was designed to be used as a weapon. The trial judge properly considered the evidence in the context of the issues to be addressed. The Court held that a sword is not prima facie a weapon. The Crown appeal was dismissed."
"The appellant seeks leave to appeal an order by the Chambers judge acting in his capacity as an Administrative Judge appointed pursuant to the Court Administration Protocol (CAP) established as part of the settlement of the Indian Residential Schools litigation. The parties are disputing the respondent's obligations under the CAP. Each party has made an application for directions for directions. The respondent, which is not seeking leave, applies to have the Chief Judge of the CAP refer to its legal fees and disbursements as a comprehensive database for verification. The Administrative Judge made no error in requiring the respondent to supply the redacted electronic billing records as whole from the 'live data' for the residential schools litigation. HELD: Leave to appeal is denied. The order appealed from was simply a discretionary order designed to move the verification process along and ensure the process meets its overall objective of determining if the amount of MLG's fee is reasonable and equitable. An appeal will unduly delay the proceedings and will unnecessarily add to the cost of proceedings. There are no issues of importance to the administration of justice to warrant consideration by the Court.","The prospective appellant applied to leave to appeal an order made in Chambers. The Merchant Law Group and the Crown had been involved in protracted negotiations regarding the manner in which Merchant would bill the Crown for legal fees regarding their representation of Indian residential school claimants. The parties eventually reached a 'Verification Agreement', respecting the verification of Merchant's legal fees and disbursements. In order to protect solicitor-client privilege, Merchant's software company was able to develop redacted electronic billing records with the privileged information removed. When Merchant did submit a bill, it was discovered that the electronic billing records were inaccurate. The parties then became involved in a dispute regarding the Merchant's obligations under the Agreement. They had each made an application to a Chambers judge acting in his capacity as an administrative judge for the purposes of the Agreement for directions. The judge ordered (see: 2012 SKQB 517) that Merchant should contact its former software company and arrange for them to re-create the redacted electronic billing records as a whole from the 'live data' in the appellant's present billing program. Before the software company would perform this task, the Court ordered Merchant to pay the outstanding fees. Merchant had disputed these fees and had refused to pay them. Merchant took the position that the administrative judge had exceeded his jurisdiction by requiring the law firm to make this payment: the judge had over-reached his authority. In addition, the judge had based his decision on emails that were not evidence.HELD: The Court noted that leave to appeal under Court of Appeal Rule 11 is granted in accordance with the criteria established in Rothmans, Benson &amp; Hedges Inc. v. Saskatchewan. Leave to appeal was denied. The order appealed from was simply a discretionary order designed to move the verification process along and ensure the process met its overall objective of determining if the amount of Merchant's fee was reasonable and equitable. The prospective appellant failed to establish that there was a matter of sufficient importance to the proceedings or to the field of practice, the state of law or the administration of justice to warrant a determination by the Court."
"The plaintiff puts forward that he loaned $5,000 to the defendants, with an additional $1,000 being paid to the plaintiff. The defendants were living in the plaintiff's home with their wife and children. The plaintiff claims that the defendant signed the cheque and returned it, with the return of the $960 being a deduction from his December cheque. The issue of damages is whether there was a loan of $1 million, as there was no loan documentation prepared and/or signed, which one would anticipate considering the plaintiff is a corporation. The defendant testified that he received the money in a demand letter close to the time of issuing the Statement of Claim, but there was never request to pay it back earlier. The claim that the defendants asked the plaintiff to pay back the $5k000 and the $1k000 were never proven. HELD: 1) The plaintiff's claim is dismissed. There is no evidence to support the conclusion that the $2,000 was a gift from the defendant to the plaintiffs. 2) The defendant's counterclaim is not proven. 3) The defendants had the free use of the defendant's home and the defendants' car whenever they needed it. There was no basis to withhold the money from the plaintiff on the last cheque as there is no substance to the money filed by the defendant with respect to wages and vacation pay. 4) The $5K000 cheque was never given to the defendant. The statements of claim filed as exhibits do not show the money was actually paid back. The balance of probabilities are not satisfied. 5) The claim for wages is not known at this time and as the defendant may be able to now qualify and receive funds retroactively for the special benefits from Service Canada, in light of the Court's finding that she has worked 604 hours. It may be that there are no damages incurred by the plaintiff if she now qualifies for payment from service Canada. If she is not able to obtain the payments that she lost, the Court will hear evidence and argument on the quantum of damages to be paid by the plaintiffs to Lilia.  6) Lilia's claim was adjourned.","HELD: The Court concluded that the $1,000 loan did not exist, there was nothing on the books showing an advance of wages as submitted by the plaintiff. The Court was not satisfied that the defendant husband received a loan from the plaintiff in the amount of $5,000. There was no loan documentation, which would be expected given the money was advanced from the plaintiff corporation. The plaintiff never demanded any of the money be paid back until just before issuing the statement of claim. The Court also held that the $5,000 to the defendant wife was a gift. The counterclaim of $2,400 was not proven; there was no evidence that these payments were not made with consent. The $960 should not have been taken off of the defendant husband’s cheque because the $1,000 and $5,000 loans were not made out. The defendant husband was successful in this portion of his counterclaim. The Court found that $2,400 given to the plaintiff by the defendant wife was also by agreement. The defendant wife’s testimony with respect to her hours worked were favoured over the plaintiff’s. The defendant wife was overpaid for work in November so the plaintiff was only owed $32.32. The plaintiff filed an inaccurate Record of Employment knowing that the defendant wife was trying to obtain employment insurance. The amount of damages owing to the defendant wife was adjourned to allow her to make a new claim with Service Canada for employment insurance given the Court’s determination of her hours worked, which would be enough to qualify for employment insurance."
"The accused was convicted of possession for the purposes of trafficking cocaine. He had been bound by a youth probation order for failing to comply with a previous order to not attend a youth court event despite having been convicted of the same offence two months prior. The accused had been in La Ronge, Saskatchewan selling cocaine and had a previous criminal record of 39 days. The Court found that with this not being a violent offence and with his limited criminal record, the accused was not subject to custody under either s. 39(1)(a), (b) or (c) of the Youth Criminal Justice Act. The most aggravating factor was the fact that the accused had returned to La Rongee, Saskatchewan, after serving 9 months pre-trial custody, and had sold cocaine for the purpose of trafficking. The court found that the youth had concentrated his sales mostly on a geographic area that was frequented by youth and that the drug being possessed for the trafficking was highly addictive and very often results in horrifying violence. The Crown had tried to use the cocaine as a weapon in the trafficking operation and had been unsuccessful in obtaining a conviction. The youth was sentenced to 6 months deferred custody followed by 12 months probation. The sentence imposed on the accused, who had been prohibited from attending a youth youth court gathering place for the past 3 years, had been subject to a 6 month deferred custody order. The aggravating factors were that the young accused was only 1 month into a probation order after having been found with possession for purposes of the trafficking cocaine and he had sold the cocaine in the back seat of his vehicle. The Youth Criminal justice Act requires that youth be subject to some form of custody in order to promote their rehabilitation. The application of s. 40(1) of The Youth Code is based on the principle that the circumstances of this offence are so aggravating that nothing less than custody will satisfy the principles of sentencing set out in s. 38 of the Code.","The accused was convicted after trial of trafficking cocaine and breach of probation. The issue was whether the accused could be sentenced to a custodial disposition under s. 39(1)(d) of the Youth Criminal Justice Act. HELD: The youth was sentenced to deferred custody. The amount of cocaine was significant, the accused was the only person involved in the offence, it was a fairly unsophisticated operation, the impact on the small northern community where the offence occurred was huge, it is aggravating that the drug being trafficked was cocaine, the accused has a previous criminal record for trafficking, the place where the offence was committed is a friendship centre and a popular gathering spot for youth in the area and the offence was committed for financial gain. The Court held that the most aggravating factor on sentence was that the accused was less than one month into a probation order imposed for trafficking cocaine and was to stay out of the province. The Court held that it was impossible to conclude that the probation order the accused had previously been placed on had in any way achieved its goal of rehabilitation and reintegration of the offender."
"FIAT: This is a high-conflict family law matter. The mother wants to change her residence (and that of the two young children) presently. The father has a significant history of criminal behaviour, is presently incarcerated and will be for at least the balance of this year and beyond. HELD: 1) The mother's move with the children is an interim basis. She has formed a new relationship with the father and he is currently incarcerated. While he has been in jail for a number of months, he has not seen the children for the last few months. This is not a tenable situation. The children cannot remain 'on hold' while he awaits release for, inter alia, beating the mother of the children.  2) The Court is of the view that the children's best interests are best served by the mother remaining the primary parent and that this be done here. While the father's new relationship and his incarceration means a new sibling will be introduced into their lives, this is not an exceptional case. 3) The move is not for job, nor for any other sort of economic opportunity. He does not presently (nor in the near future) present a viable parenting alternative. In any event, the children have access with their father while he is incarcerated. 4) There is nothing suggesting the two boys have anything other than a close and loving relationship with her. While she has a duty to promote and foster this access, the Court has insufficient evidence to conclude, on a balance of probabilities, that these two children would benefit from this relationship.","The petitioner mother has entered into a new relationship and is pregnant. She wants to move with the parties' two children to live with her new spouse. The respondent father is currently in jail and will be incarcerated for the balance of the calendar year. The respondent opposes the move and wants access to his children at the jail. The mother had unilaterally moved with the children prior to making this application in the face of an existing court order. One of the reasons that respondent is in jail is because he assaulted the petitioner. HELD: The Court was of the view that this was an exceptional case that warranted permitting the move on an interim basis. The petitioner's new relationship and the impending birth of a new sibling for the children is a material change in circumstances. The move is justified because the petitioner is the only parent available to the children and it would defy common sense to deprive the children of a relationship with their new sibling, particularly when the respondent is unavailable as a parent and there is no reasonable basis to conclude that matters can be resolved in the father's favour. The respondent asked to have the issue of custody and access delayed until his release. This is not a realistic option. It was clear that the father had not truly considered the best interests of his children in opposing this application and that the mother's position would likely prevail at trial. With respect to access with the father in jail, there was no evidence that visiting the respondent in jail would be beneficial to these young children. The respondent was granted telephone access and, if it was possible to arrange with corrections officials, access via Skype or Face Time."
"HELD: The accused was found not guilty of count 2, over.08. The Court found that the stop was proper and lawful. The police officer was checking for driver's licence, registration and sobriety. The evidence did not support a finding of guilt on count #1. The observation period was not properly conducted. The officer did not look 'eyeball to eyeball' at the accused for the entire duration of the observation period as that is viewed as a reasonable limit prescribed by law and justified under s. of the Charter. The video had no audio component to it and the accused's burp could be heard by the camera. The Crown cannot rely on the presumption of accuracy in s. 258(1)(c) of the Code.","HELD: The accused was not guilty of either charge. Although the accused was lawfully stopped, the roadside demand was valid and the accused declined to exercise his right to counsel on two occasions following his arrest, the observation period at the detachment was not conducted properly. The officer was sometimes focused on other things. As the observation period comprised part and parcel of a breath test, the breathalyzer test was not properly administered and the Crown could not rely on the accuracy of the readings."
"This was an appeal against the sentences imposed by the trial judge. Although the appellant pled guilty to each of the two offences, the appellant was sentenced to four years imprisonment for the armed robbery and 1 year for the weapons offence, to be served consecutively, and an order prohibiting him from possessing firearms for ten years from the date of his release, as is provided by s.100(1) of the Code, and having regard to the principles advanced in making the sentencing recommendations, the Court dismissed the appeal.","The appellant contended the trial judge erred in sentencing him to four years for an armed robbery charge, one year on a weapons charge to be served consecutively and a 10 year prohibition order because there were extenuating circumstances which should have resulted in a reduction in sentence. Dismissing the appeals, that the trial judge made no errors in his considerations. The sentences were consistent with the range the Appeal Court had approved in numerous judgments."
"An appeal from a decision declaring that the respondent Guardian was not liable to contribute to payment of a fire loss that was insured against by the appellant Hartford. The respondent had entered a contract with Fraser-Brace for the construction of a hospital and required the insurer to obtain fire insurance. Without acknowledging liability, the insurer paid $400,000 to Hartford to facilitate progress payments to Delta by the insurer. The trial judge found the policy had been issued under the mistaken belief that it was required to carry builder's risk insurance. The policy was never at the insured's risk; the policy was void and the insurer ordered Hartford to repay the advances with compound interest. The appellant appealed. Dismissing the appeal, that there was no evidence nor even suggestion that the fire had caused the fire nor that the agreement between the respondent and the Province was implied by the contract to be a pre-judgment interest.","This was an appeal of a decision declaring that the respondent was not liable to contribute to payment of a fire loss that was insured against by the appellant. Dismissing the appeal, that the insurer of a subcontractor on a construction project was not liable to contribute to payment of a fire loss by the insurer of the principle contractor where the risk was allocated by the contract documents to the principle contractor and not the subcontractor."
"FIAT. The accused applied to quash a preliminary hearing order made by the Provincial Court judge committing him to stand trial on a charge that he committed a defamatory libel against a police officer contrary to ss.300 and 301 of the Criminal Code and his complaint with respect to an ongoing investigation of another potential offence. HELD: The application was dismissed. There was not a scintilla of evidence to suggest either the judge was biased or that there was an apprehension of bias by the accused. As the preliminary order was not reviewed by the Court, the application for an order quashing the conditional recognizance was not dismissed.",FIAT Application (1)to quash committal to stand trial on a charge of defamatory libel and (2)to quash certain conditions of a recognizance issued at the preliminary hearing. HELD: (1)Application dismissed. The Provincial Court judge was not biased and the accused received full disclosure with respect to the charge. In an application to quash committal for trial there is only one ground for action by the reviewing court and that is lack of jurisdiction. (2)Application dismissed. The conditions imposed by the Provincial Court Judge were justified. He did not err in law or in his application of the facts.
"The mother brought a motion for variation of child support pursuant to the Federal Child Support Guidelines. She also brought an application for an order fixing the amount owing under the previous child support order of Baynton J., dated September 5, 1990. HELD: 1)The respondent had not paid the applicant's 1996 tax liability for the child support in the amount of $1,713. However, immediately prior to this matter being heard in chambers, he made the payment. The children continued to live with the mother and she remarried and babysited. The applicant claimed child support and claimed s.7 expenses. This claim was based on orthodontic costs for Kurtis. 2)The guidelines require the court to use the most recent information. 3)The financial evidence filed by the respondent with respect to 1997 was not sufficient to determine income. In that regard, the respondent was going to impute 15% of the capital cost allowance claimed on personal property to the respondent pursuant to s.19 in each of the above years. Findings that the applicant has appropriately deducted expenses from her gross income as she has only deducted a portion of her home and vehicle expenses; that portion is attributable to her business. 4)The court declined to include the 1997 income information in this calculation, despite the fact that the guidelines require it to be used.","An application for variation of child support pursuant to the Federal Child Support Guidelines including an amount for extraordinar expenses of $3,900 for orthodontic work. The parties married in 1981 and were divorced in 1990. The father was $1,713 in arrears until immediately prior to the matter being heard in chambers. He consented to $1,800 owing for 1997. HELD:1)The father was to pay $454 for child support for the two children who lived with the mother. His proportionate share of orthodontic expenses was 86% ($1,677) to be paid by five payments of $280. 2)The respondent's average income over 1994-96 for the purpose of determining child support was $32,243.39. The 1997 income information was not included because the financial evidence was insufficient. 15% of the capital cost allowance was imputed pursuant to s19 for the 1994-96 taxation years. Deducting all of the respondent's capital cost allowance was not a reasonable expense. An adverse inference was not drawn from the failure to produce the financial records of the respondent's farming partner. 3)The applicant's average income for 1994-96 for purposes of calculating the s7 expense was $5,278.40. 4)The father was to pay $1,800 prior to April 30/98 as payment under the 1990 order. 5)The father was ordered to produce the documents referred to in s21 to the applicant by May 1st each year. 6)The applicant was awarded solicitor/client costs of her application to determine the amount of outstanding maintenance owing for 1996 and 1997 and her taxable costs on the balance of the application."
"The trial judge found no negligent misrepresentation but awarded damages equivalent to five months notice for wrongful dismissal and also the notice period for the wrongful dismissal. The appellant cross-appealed, claiming the five-month notice period should be reduced due to her failure to mitigate her loss. The Supreme Court of Canada confirmed the long standing legal right of employers and employees to terminate an employment contract at any time provided there was no express provision to the contrary. If an employer dismisses an employee without good cause, he must give the employee reasonable notice or compensation in lieu of notice. Here the employee was mistaken if she honestly believed that partnership would come, as matter of course, after two or three years employment. In any event, the term in the contract providing for dismissal on notice was an effective disclaimer precluding any separate action in tort.","The respondent was recruited by the respondents. Her job was to start quality assurance practice. She accepted an offer of employment, giving up her own company to do so. After 15 months she was dismissed. The trial judge in her action for wrongful dismissal and negligent misrepresentation did not find any negligent misrepresentation but awarded damages equivalent to five months notice for wrongful dismissal. The appellant appealed the dismissal of her claim for negligent misrepresentation and the notice period for her wrongful dismissal. The respondent cross-appealed the damage award, claiming the trial judge failed to take into account the appellant's failure to mitigate. Appeal and cross-appeal, that the evidence supports the trial judge's findings, and he did not make any errors in law."
"The action concerned alleged negligence and reckless helicopter transportation by the defendants, the defendants and their corporate parent, KOC. The plaintiff corporations alleged the defendants carried on a negligent and reckless chopper shuttle operation to and from the work site. The defendants deny they or any of them were the alter egos of the deceased, but state that KOC was and is a separate and distinct corporation which operates the Kumtor Project independently and of its own will by its own Board of Directors. The Certificate of Disclosure was prepared for the purpose of providing a safety report to the defendants. It was also prepared for all parties. The only significance of the plaintiffs identifying the theories they may hold behind any questioning with respect to these issues is that by disclosing the theory it is easier to determine whether such questioning is or could be logically relevant to a fact or position in issue. The Court found that allowing questions on whether insurance was obtained does not mean the plaintiffs are entitled to question the details of the budget, or why money was spent in certain areas as opposed to other areas, which is relevant to the issue of unsafe operation. The Law of Privilege is claimed. The issue is whether the respondents knew of the necessity of having two Kyrgyzstan persons on board the defendants' chopper to evaluate the liability issues. The plaintiffs allege the defendants knew the helicopters were unsafe, yet continued to use them. The Code of Conduct for the plaintiffs was reviewed and the claim for solicitor client privilege is claimed by the Court. The following issues were raised: 1) which of the defendants was entitled to insure the safety of the passengers on the helicopter; 2) which liability was assumed by the respondents; 3) which individuals were entitled to insurance for the operation of the road from the site to the mine; 4) which which individuals entitled to payment for the helicopter transportation; 5) which whether the defendants were entitled for the cost of such insurance or insurance; and 6) which were not entitled to pay for the flight. The court found that the claim was not inherently or identically connected to the deceased's claim. The 7 theories were not allowed on the application. The application was dismissed. The Judge found that there was no evidence before the Court to justify the granting of the right to examine the theories in question. The defendant corporations were obliged to answer questions directed at whether insurance or payment were obtained, and if so who arranged and paid for the same. The questions related to the insurance policy and the number of consultants retained were irrelevant.","FIAT. One of the nine plaintiffs, legal representatives of passengers killed in a helicopter crash in 1995, and two defendants sought better testimonial and documentary discovery. Objections to questions or to the production of documents at the examinations for discovery fell under relevance and privilege. The plaintiffs alleged the defendants carried on a negligent and reckless shuttle service to and from the work site and that the Cameco group could not avoid liability by reason of having hired the Kyrgyzstan National Airline as an independent contractor. HELD: 1)Relevancy. The plaintiffs were entitled to question officers of the corporations and receive production of all documents touching on the issues of why the helicopter and the airline were selected; who made these decisions and whether KOC was the alter ego or agent for Cameco in this respect; whether the airline was unsafe; if so, should any of the defendants have known it was unsafe; was it inherently dangerous; and if so, could the defendants rely on the independent contractor defence. Questions relating to availability, cost and reliability of alternative forms of transportation were logically relevant. Questions as to topography were relevant as background information and supported the allegation the shuttle was inherently dangerous. Whether the project was over budget was relevant but the budget itself was not. Although questions directed at whether insurance was arranged and by whom were to be answered, the information is not automatically admissible at trial. Questions relating to the e-mail system and when survival gear was placed on board were properly answerable. Records as to when the tickets were reserved and purchased were to be produced. Counsel is not required to justify why every particular question is asked. The relationship between Cameco and it various subsidiaries was in issue and the information as to when the president met certain people was broadly relevant. Leave was granted to reapply for direction. 2)Privilege:(a)The defendants were ordered to date any document for which privilege was claimed. The document must be sufficiently identified to allow the opposing party to assess whether the claim for privilege should be challenged. (b)The request for names of the persons who prepared documents was simply an attempt to investigate the investigation and was not permitted. The Rules of Court do not require the names of expert witnesses who prepared reports for which privilege is claimed. The same rationale applies to non- expert privileged memoranda. (c)Pre-accident observations disclosed to someone in the subsequent privileged investigation are disclosable. The plaintiff is entitled to ask the name of any employee who expressed safety concerns about the shuttle prior to the accident. While matters of opinion only, such concerns are disclosable. A reciprocal order with respect to the names of potential witnesses was made in favour of the defendants. (d)Litigation privilege attaches only until such time as party determines to utilize the document at trial. Under the Rules of Court party must disclose any such document and produce any existing expert reports prior to the pre-trial conference. (e)The report on safety equipment and survival gear prepared by the KOC Safety Superintendent was to be reviewed by the court to assess whether or to what extent it was privileged. It was not known whether the Report prepared after litigation included matters other than what the Superintendent was requested to report on prior to the accident. (f)It was ordered that information given by a former senior level KOC employee would not amount to a breach of the confidentiality agreement. The agreement not to disclose any proprietary information, including business information, was broad enough to include privileged investigations carried out by the employer. Counsel for KOC and Kilborn were permitted to be present at the interview. (g)The chronology document was privileged on the basis it represented the product of a privileged investigation. 3)The necessary criteria under Rule 222(a) was not established to justify examining for discovery the two former employees. The request to explore post accident conduct of senior executives was dismissed. Seeking to establish alternate forms of transportation was irrelevant to the issues. 4)Particulars of the statutes and regulations referred to in the statement of claim, sought under Rule 142, were to be supplied within 45 days. 5)The question asking the spouse if in her opinion her husband would have boarded an aircraft he felt was unsafe was improper as framed. The question was relevant only to character. Character evidence is limited to reputation in the community and does not allow for personal opinion. 6)There was no order as to costs as success was mixed."
"The applicant sought an order declaring that the land use by-law of the respondent permits the operation of a billiard club open to the public. The applicant had a special premises liquor license, granted by the Province of Nova Scotia, which allowed the sale of liquor on the premises. The club was in a rural area and subject to the respondent's Land Use By-laws. The development officer at the time determined that the club's use was a 'change in use' which constituted a change in use requiring a development permit. Application allowed; change in the liquor license sought by the applicant would only have the effect of moving the applicant's use from one subcategory of drinking establishment to another. A development agreement was not required as the club was not a 'drinking establishment' as defined in the By-law; nor was it development within the meaning of that word as defined by the Municipal Government Act. Both remoteness and neighbourhood effects had role to play in the proper disposition of this type of case.","The applicant operated commercial private billiards club with liquor licence and served bar food. The applicant applied to amend the liquor licence to another category to allow public access and slightly longer hours of operation. The Municipality refused to issue a letter to the effect that the premises were properly zoned for that purpose, arguing that the proposal would result in a change in use requiring a development agreement. The applicant applied for an order declaring that the land use by-law permitted the proposed use. Application granted; the proposal did not constitute a change in use as the essential use of the premises was the sale of liquor and food in a pool hall and that would not change. There was no evidence that the proposal would result in a nuisance or increased traffic, neither of which could be presumed."
"Paddy Lemaigre applies for relief pursuant to the Charter of Rights on the basis of post-charge delay denying him the right to have his trial in a reasonable time. There was no Charter breach. HELD: The application was dismissed. The Court found no actual or inferred prejudice and that the conditions of release subject to release were not soerous as to result in any significant prejudice. The prejudice to the accused in the delay was not something that he could overcome. The delay of three months between the first and second trial dates was considered as attributable to the Crown, it being necessary because of the non-attendance of the complainant who was under subpoena to attend, and there was no evidence of any efforts by the accused to overcome this prejudice. As the accused had pled guilty to three offences of breaching his undertaking and was sentenced to three intervening offences, this prejudice did not outweigh the prejudice to society that would result if he was not to face trial.","The accused applies for relief pursuant to the Charter of Rights on the basis of post-charge delay denying him the right to have his trial in a reasonable time. The accused was charged on July 3, 2003 with common assault contrary to s. 266 of the Criminal Code, threatening to use weapon contrary to s. 267(a) of the Code, and destroying property of value less than $5,000 contrary to s. 430(4) of the Code. On July 31, 2003, the accused first appeared in court. The information was adjourned until October 6, 2003 due to lack of Legal Aid resources. On November 3, 2003, not guilty plea was entered and trial was set for May 6, 2004. On May 6, 2004, the trial was adjourned on application by the Crown due to the non-attendance of the complainant and new trial date was set for October 7, 2004. HELD: There was no Charter breach and the application is dismissed. 1) The length of delay from the date of release to the date of trial is approximately 15 months. This is not a complicated case and the delay warrants an inquiry. 2) The Court did not accept the accused's submission that he suffered actual prejudice because the undertaking prevented him from accessing his children. There were no efforts by the accused to overcome this. 3) The restrictive condition in the undertakings prohibiting him from drinking alcohol has resulted in him being charged with and pleading guilty to offences of breaching his undertaking. As these offences all occurred within what could be considered a reasonable time for the matter to proceed to trial, there is no actual prejudice to the accused. 3) This is a charge that involves an offence of domestic violence and is so serious that it carries the heightened public interest that exists in offences of violence."
"The plaintiff, who was pursuing a shoplifter, was run down in a cross walk in a mall parking lot by the van that was being used as the getaway vehicle in the shoplifting heist. The plaintiff and his insurance company, ING, joined the action against the van's alleged owner and his co-accused under his Section (uninsured motorist) coverage. The Court found that the plaintiff had no documentation whatsoever in proof of the sale of the van to the accused and that he retained a lawyer to prepare a Statutory Declaration. HELD: The Court awarded the all inclusive sum of $162,500. It remained for the court to decide whether that sum was to be paid by Allstate or by ING. The facts were very much in dispute which necessitates a number of credibility findings to be made. The only clear evidence on the identity of the accused was his admitted poor memory of the events that occurred within the general time frame. He admitted that he sold the vehicle to the woman who supplied his cocaine addiction, the fact that it was a grey cargo van with a shabby paint job and a rear mounted post light, which perhaps explained why he was unable to discern the license plate identification or even whether license plate was on the vehicle at all. There were numerous inconsistencies in the plaintiff's evidence, most of which related to the issue of credibility.","The plaintiff, while working as security officer in mall, was run down in the parking lot as he was pursuing shoplifter. The van that struck him, driven by second individual, was being used as getaway vehicle. The issue before the court was whether the agreed-upon damages were to be paid by the liability insurer of the registered owner of the vehicle (who was not the driver) or by the plaintiff's Section D (uninsured motorist) insurer. As the first defendant remained the registered owner of the vehicle at the relevant time and failed to rebut the statutory presumption that it was being operated by the second defendant (who had now disappeared) with his consent at that time, the vehicle's insurer was responsible to pay the plaintiff's damages. The action against the plaintiff's Section D insurer is dismissed. The case turned on numerous credibility issues as the registered owner of the vehicle professed to have sold it few days prior to the incident (although he maintained insurance on the vehicle for several months afterwards), and it was argued that the second defendant (whom the plaintiff had detained for shoplifting earlier that day) was not the driver of the vehicle."
"The Bank of Montreal (the Bank) presents a motion to the Court to determine the priority position of the Bank and the respondent Patchrite (Patchrite) respecting assets leased by the Bank. The applications are brought pursuant to ss. 63 and 66 of The Personal Property Security Act. HELD: The Court finds that the Bank is'regularly engaged in the business of leasing' within the meaning of the PPSA and therefore it is not entitled to the exemption from the registration requirements of s. 3. The lease in question was therefore a lease for a term of more than one year and it required registration. Having failed to register its leasehold interest at the personal property registry, the Bank's claim to the equipment is subordinate to the registered and first priority claim of The Bank.","The Bank presents a motion to the Court to determine the priority position of the Bank and the respondent corporation respecting assets leased by the respondent to Sweeprite. By agreed statement of facts and issue, the parties have agreed that the issue to be determined is whether the Bank has priority to, or entitlement to, the equipment subject to the Lease. This requires a determination of whether the Lease was a 'lease for a term of more than one year' as defined by s. 2(1)(y) of The Personal Property Security Act. HELD: The respondent was 'regularly engaged in the business of leasing', within the meaning of s. 2(1)(y)(iv) of the PPSA and therefore is not entitled to the exemption from registration requirements of s. 3 of the Act. The lease in question was therefore 'a lease for a term of more than one year' within the meaning of the Act and it required registration. Having failed to register its leasehold interest at the personal property registry, the respondent's claim to the equipment is subordinate to the registered and first priority claim of the Bank. 1) There is no evidence of any business activity at all that the respondent engaged in until May 2001 when it had transferred back to it Sweeprite's land, building and equipment. The respondent in turn rented back the building, land and equipment, none of which ever left Sweeprite's possession, to Sweeprite under the terms of non-written agreement. Sweeprite paid rental to the respondent. Ultimately the respondent and Sweeprite entered into the equipment lease for term of years. 2) In 2001 when the non-written lease/rental agreement first began, the respondent had no other business except the ownership and lease to and/or rental of the land, building and equipment to Sweeprite. It was not until December of 2001 when it obtained the research and development contract with Rite Way. 3) The business of leasing, which had started in the spring of 2001 under the non-written arrangement and which continued thereafter by virtue of the equipment lease until the bankruptcy of Sweeprite, was from May to December of 2001 the only business of the respondent and thereafter continued to be a significant part of the respondent's business."
"This was an appeal from a decision of Madam Justice Rothery who granted a motion to withdraw the case from the jury in an action for damages in negligence brought by the appellant (plaintiff), Kevin Miezianko, against the respondents (defendants), Bjorkdale Lions Club Inc. and Village of Bjorksdale (Defendants). The action arose out of burns suffered when gasoline from the gas tank located behind the driver's seat of the vehicle he was driving splashed on him and was set on fire shortly afterwards, after he had signalled his desire to have the contest halted and his vehicle had come to stop. HELD: The appeal was dismissed in its entirety. 1)There was no tenable basis to interfere with the decision of the jury. 2)The Court was of the view that the action was preordained to failure in light of the evidence and the burden upon the appellant to prove each of the elements of his cause of action. To put the case on appeal at its highest, let us assume without deciding that, as the appellant contends, she made too much of the need for expert evidence in relation to the standards of care in issue. Even then, the Court found that the Court could not have found the requisite causal connection between the appellant's injury and the acts of negligence committed by the respondents. 3)Had the case been permitted to go to the jury on the theory of the appellant, the jury would have been asked to conclude on a balance of probabilities that, but for the actions of the flagman who failed to immediately halt the competition and alert the Fire Department to the condition he had observed, the appellant would have suffered less serious burns than he in fact suffered. The Court was also of the opinion that it could not rationally have concluded that either of the respondents caused or contributed to the extent of his injury.","This is an appeal from a decision of the trial judge who granted a motion to withdraw the case from the jury in an action for damages in negligence brought by the appellant plaintiff against the respondent defendants. The action arose out of burn suffered by the appellant while participating in demolition derby run by the defendants. The motion was granted on the premise there was no case to go to the jury because the appellant had failed to adduce sufficient evidence of the requisite causal connection between his injury and the alleged acts of negligence, and the standard of care required of the respondents. In consequence, the trial judge dismissed the action with costs to the respondents. The issue on appeal is whether the trial judge applied the test correctly in light of the evidence. HELD: Appeal dismissed. 1) Had the case been permitted to go to the jury on the theory of the appellant, the jury would have been asked to conclude on a balance of probabilities that, but for the actions of the flagman who failed to immediately halt the competition and alert the Fire Department to the condition he had observed, the appellant would have suffered less serious burns than he in fact suffered. Similarly, the jury would have been asked to conclude that, but for the failure of the volunteer fire fighters to take more effective action, the appellant would have suffered less serious burns. The jury could not have arrived at either conclusion, given the evidence of the duration the appellant was on fire, about 30 seconds, and the expert evidence that his injuries would have occurred virtually instantaneously or within 5 to 6 seconds of his having caught on fire while still in his vehicle. In the light of this evidence, and in the absence of further evidence of the standard of care required of each of the respondent, the Court is of the opinion the jury could not rationally have concluded that either of the respondents caused or materially contributed to the extend of the appellant's injury. On the basis of the expert evidence, the damage would have occurred just the same, fault or no fault on the part of the respondents. That being so, the damage could not be seen to have been caused or materially contributed to by the respondents. 2) There is no tenable basis for this Court to interfere with the trial judge's award of costs."
"The respondent applied to vary the original custody judgment, which provided for joint custody of the child with shared parenting according to a specified schedule. The issues were that the mother failed to abide by the terms of the original judgment and refused to provide the father with any information as to the location of herself or the child. The application also requested an order allowing the father to relocate with the child to Whitehorse, Yukon, for residential purposes. HELD: 1) There had been a material change in the circumstances which existed at the time of the Original Custody Judgment when it was thought that the cooperation of the parties, which would be necessary for a joint custody arrangement, was possible. As the mother demonstrated that it was not, a review of the order as to custody is justified. 2) The evidence confirmed each of the seven points outlined by the father in support of the proposed relocation. The respondent had been granted sole custody in June 2006 and by this judgment has now been granted interim custody. The child is currently enrolled in kindergarten and daycare close to her father's apartment in Saskatoon. However, her kindergarten teacher confirmed that the child copes well with changes in her environment. 3) The respondent has made significant efforts to improve his parenting skills, the strong bond he has forged between himself and his daughter, the desirability of maximizing contact between the child and both parents and the desirable prospect of exposure to both parents. The court is satisfied that there has been a significant change in circumstances that would allow the respondent to have sole custody. There is no question that there will be significant changes in the child's life and the circumstances of this case. There will be a significant increase in the number of visits by the respondent and the increased contact with her extended family in the Yukon provides an increased social network that would be in the best interest.","The respondent father applied by way of notice of motion to vary a custody judgment that provided for joint custody of the child with shared parenting according to a specified schedule. The grounds for the application were that the mother had failed to abide by the terms of the original judgment and had refused to provide the father with any information as to the location of herself and the child since the date of that judgment. The mother had left Saskatoon, taking the child with her and, subsequent to police involvement and several Court orders to assist in locating the child, was arrested on Canada-wide warrant in Edmonton, Alberta and charged pursuant to ss. 281(1) and 283 of the Criminal Code of Canada with child abduction and contravention of custody order. The applicant submitted that the mother had placed the child at risk of harm and accordingly it was in the best interests of the child that the father be granted sole custody. The applicant also requested an order providing only supervised access to the child by the mother. The father filed a further application seeking an order allowing him to relocate the child to Whitehorse, Yukon, for residential purposes. The mother opposed the father's application for relocation, and prayed that she be granted less restrictive access to the child. The issues were as follows. 1) Should the father be granted sole custody of the child? 2) Should the father be allowed to relocate with the child to Whitehorse, Yukon? 3) What access to the child should be granted to the mother? HELD: Application allowed. The father shall have the costs of the trial on party and party basis. 1) The starting point for the Court's review is whether the father has demonstrated material change in the circumstances affecting the child. The Court is satisfied that there has been a material change in the circumstances that existed at the time of the original custody judgment when it was thought that the cooperation of the parties necessary for joint custody was possible. As the mother has demonstrated it was not, review of the order to determine whether change in custody or access order is in the best interests of the child, having regard to all of the circumstances of this case. Based on the original findings and the evidence at trial that the father has cared well for the child, as well as the mother's conduct in attempting to avoid shared parenting, the Court is satisfied that it is in the child's best interests to grant sole custody to the father. 2) The evidence at trial confirmed the seven points that the father outlined in support of the proposed relocation to Whitehorse. In reviewing each of seven factors set out in the case law and considering the best interests of the child, the Court approves the father's plan to relocate to Whitehorse. 3) It is in the child's best interests to continue the mother's existing access arrangements with the child until the child moves with the father to Yukon, at which time the new access arrangements set out in this decision will apply. Detailed orders are issued accordingly."
"This is an application for judicial review of a Board of Arbitration Award which held that the First Nations University of Canada had violated certain provisions of a Collective Agreement in force between the parties. The facts of the case are reasonably straightforward. The applicant is a First Nations faculty member who is First Nations. The grievance alleged that the University had interfered with his academic freedom. The allegation had to do with the withdrawal of an invitation to the applicant to be the keynote speaker at a symposium. The Board of Governors met in April and the applicant received his Ph.D. degree from the University of Regina. That meeting ended with no decision having taken place regarding the matter raised in the applicant's letter. HELD: The application is dismissed with costs. The reasons as a whole support the decision. The decision meets the reasonableness test. 1) The applicant failed in his obligation to refrain from interfering in and to defend the academic freedom of a faculty member.  2) There is no question that the applicant violated the collective agreement. However, the Board made a clear finding of fact that the alleged breach of the Collective Agreement occurred while the Board was acting in its capacity as Chair of the University's Board and not as an officer of the Federation. That finding brought the issue within the purview of the Agreement. 3) The formal grievance specifically refers to interference with the respondent's academic freedom in the second paragraph under the heading NATURE OF DISPUTE. These actions by FNUC and its Board are an abuse of authority and are harassing and intimidating actions against the respondent. In addition, the actions by the Board have interfered with the academic liberty of the applicant in violation of the FNUC/URFA Academic Collective Bargaining Agreement.","Application for judicial review of a board of arbitration award that held the First Nations University of Canada had violated certain provisions of a collective agreement in force between the parties. The grievance alleged that the University had interfered with faculty member's academic freedom. The allegation concerned the withdrawal of an invitation to that faculty member to be the keynote speaker at National Symposium on Post Secondary Education Policy and Funding that was held on campus, although the University was not directly involved. After one of the chief organizers examined the faculty member's thesis and determined it would not provide suitable foundation for the symposium's keynote address, the invitation was withdrawn. The faculty member sought to have the decision reversed, and requested the University's Board of Governors' intervention. When the faculty member's request came up at one of the Board's meetings, one of its members made some inappropriate comments and expressed personal animus towards the faculty member. No decision was reached at that meeting. The respondent Board of Arbitration found that, in failing in his obligation to refrain from interfering in and to defend the academic freedom of a faculty member, the Board member's comportment amounted to a violation of the collective agreement by the employer. The applicant argued that the Board of Arbitration exceeded its jurisdiction by entertaining a grievance that did not involve parties to the collective agreement. Further, it argued that the Board of Arbitration made a determination of an issue not raised in the grievance, namely, a finding that there was a violation of academic freedom. HELD: The application is dismissed with costs. The Board of Arbitration found that the member of the University's Board of Governors' comportment at the meeting did not accord with the requirements of certain articles of the collective agreement. The reasons of the Board of Arbitration support that finding and the decision meets the reasonableness test. The fact that the member of the Board of Governors was acting in his capacity as Chair brought the issue within the purview of the collective agreement. The Court disagrees with the applicant's contention that the Board of Arbitration made a determination of an issue not raised in the grievance directly."
"FIAT: The first access issue was for an order that would enable the petitioner to exercise increased access to the two young children born of his relationship with the respondent. HELD: 1) The court found no evidence of any material change in circumstances that would warrant a change in the petitioner's regular access. The access provisions in the February 2007 fiat were for two non-consecutive periods consisting of no more than five overnights each during July and August and for a period subsequent to April 10, 2007, she ordered that the petitioner have access. This was not so much in the nature of a variation as an extrapolation of the previous order. When coupled with his regular access, the increase the petitioner seeks would result in his having the children for two months in the spring. It is reasonable that, during this period, his contact with the children should be increased. Unfortunately, more than a year has passed and the matter has not even been set down for a pre-trial.","FIAT: A previous interim order detailed specific access in the period leading up to pre-trial or trial, however more than a year has passed and the matter has not even been set down for pre-trial. The petitioner seeks to increase access to the two children of the relationship and an order to address holiday periods not covered in the previous order. HELD: There shall be no change in the previously ordered access schedule.  The Court found no change in the material circumstances that would warrant a change in the petitioner's regular access schedule. Because of the petitioner's work schedule, the increased access is unlikely to result in any meaningful time with the children. The holiday access requested was in the nature of an extrapolation of the previous order and the Court ordered holiday access in such a fashion as to continue that order."
"The appellant appeals his conviction for common assault under s. 266 of the Criminal Code on the basis that his non-lawyer agent, Richard Klassen, provided him with ineffective assistance resulting in a miscarriage of justice. HELD: The appeal is dismissed. 1) There was no procedural unfairness to the appellant. He did not get the standard of representation that a competent lawyer could provide, that came as a result of the decisions he freely made. Nor did the fact that the agent was not a lawyer create any presumption as to the agent's competence. The law in this area is well established and there is little reason to embark on further analysis of the factors that may have led to the decision not to testify. 2) The trial judge believed the complainant and there was nothing in the evidence led either by the Crown or the defence that he found to detract from her evidence. The tactical decision to attack the credibility of the complainant through challenge to the audio tape was not based on a lack of confidence in the lawyer's ability. The decision to not testify was made solely on the advice of the trial judge and was not supported by the evidence.  3) The evidence at trial and the fresh evidence offered by the police officer did not establish a miscarriageof justice. 4) The Court was not in a position to decide whether the appellant's right to fair trial was diminished because of the tactics used by the agent and his lack of ability to demonstrate the ineffective assistance of the lawyer.","The appellant appeals his conviction for common assault under s. 266 of the Criminal Code on the basis that his non-lawyer agent, Richard Klassen, provided him with ineffective assistance resulting in a miscarriage of justice. HELD: The appeal is dismissed. 1) Klassen's lack of ability by itself is not a ground for determining that a miscarriage of justice occurred. There was no unfairness in the trial process. The appellant was entitled to have Klassen represent him. He made that decision freely based on information fully at hand that he consciously chose to rely on. There was no procedural unfairness to the appellant. He did not get the standard of representation that a competent lawyer could provide but that came as a result of the decisions he freely made. On appeal the appellant cannot rely on the fact that the standard of representation received was not equal to that of a competent lawyer. 2) The tactical decision to attack the credibility of the complainant through challenge to the audio tape was personally approved by the appellant. The appellant saw many lawyers in the assault case. He did not have confidence in them and pursued his original line of defence through Klassen. The Court cannot see a miscarriage of justice as a result of the tactics of the appellant and Klassen. The evidence at trial and the fresh evidence offered by the appellant's testimony and his affidavit to not establish a miscarriage of justice that may have occurred outside of the appellant's choice of agent, which is the test in R. v. Romanowicz (1999), 138 C.C.C. (3d) 225 (Ont. C.A.)."
"The accused was charged with committing an offence under s. 254(5) of the Criminal Code and knowing or ought to have known that his operation of the motor vehicle caused an accident resulting in bodily harm to another person. The Crown had called all of their witnesses on the preliminary inquiry and asked Defence Counsel if they had any witnesses to call. Defence Counsel advised that they had one witness they wished to call but that he was not available to testify on this date. Defence counsel requested an adjournment to allow Defence Counsel to make arrangements to call Sergeant Barbar as a witness for the Defence in the Preliminary Inquiry. The defence objected. HELD: The Court was satisfied that the Defence was guilty of neglect in procuring the attendance of Sergeant Barbar. The Defence was not negligent in not having made arrangements to have Sergeant Barbar available for the preliminary Inquiry. As the accused was not a material witness, the Court was not satisfied that Defence was negligent in failing to call him. The Court granted the Defence request for adjournment so that they could make the necessary arrangements to bring Sergeant Barbar into the Defence's witness list and to be able to cross-examine Sergeant Barbar when he appears as their witness. The preliminary inquiry proceeded July 26, 2010. The inquiry was set for July 26/2010 and Case Management hearing was set May 4/2010. The accused is expected to be back in Saskatoon at the end of the month.","Defence sought an adjournment of a preliminary hearing to call a police accident reconstructionist as a witness. Prior to the commencement of the hearing, defence counsel was aware that the Crown did not intend to call this person as part of its case. One month prior to the preliminary hearing, defence counsel requested that the accident reconstructionist be made available as witness. The Crown advised defence that the officer was out of the country on peace keeping mission. The officer was expected back within months of the commencement of the preliminary hearing. HELD: The defence request for an adjournment was granted. The Court could not be satisfied that the officer was not a material witness to the preliminary inquiry. The Court was not satisfied that defence was guilty of neglect in failing to procure the officer's attendance when they had been advised by the Crown that he was out of the country. The length of the adjournment would not be lengthy."
"A review of the issues of parenting and support as directed by the interim order of August 18, 2010. HELD: 1) The court was not persuaded on this review that it was in the best interests of the children to change the interim access order made in August, either by restricting access or by enlarging it. Those questions are best left for trial where full and complete evidence and issues of credibility can be considered and adjudicated. 2) Considering the existing means and needs of the parties, I declined to order interim spousal support since I was not satisfied that the respondent had the existing ability to pay it. However, the respondent must immediately obtain employment and work to his earning potential.","The parties had obtained an interim order in August 2010 and applied to vary the order pertaining to access and child support. HELD: 1) The Court declined to vary the interim access order and ordered the matter to trial. 2) The respondent is intentionally under-employed and the Court imputed annual income to him of $130,294 and child support was varied accordingly. Section 7 childcare expenses are to be shared pro rata. 3) The Court declined to order interim spousal support as the Court was not satisfied that the respondent had the existing ability to pay it. 4) The issues regarding retroactive child support, ongoing child support, access and spousal support were directed to pre-trial conference. 5) Costs of $1,500 were awarded to the petitioner and payable no later than May 31, 2011."
"The accused was charged with driving while disqualified contrary to s. 259(4) of the Criminal Code. The evidence was straightforward and uncontradicted. The only evidence was that an in-court identification was not necessary; it was sufficient that the individual with whom the police officer dealt had surrendered to the Court as demonstrated through the Appearance Notice. HELD: The accused was found not guilty. 1) The Certificate of Disqualification or Prohibition is admissible. Although there was no identification in court, the accused was provided with a copy of a letter from SGI showing the accused's name and date of birth. The letter was marked as Exhibit P-1 for identification. 2) The accused admitted that he knew that he was prohibited from driving. The Crown argued that this constitutes prima facie proof of identity and there was therefore no basis from which the Court could conclude that a s 259 offence had been committed as opposed to a violation of the Traffic Safety Act. The Court was referred to authorities who examined driver records, obtained a photograph of the accused and set a date for trial. 3) The Court had no doubt whatsoever that the person named on the letter was the same person who had stood trial.","The Crown found the accused not guilty. With respect to the issue of identification, it held that the officer was empowered by s. 209.1(2)(a) of The Traffic Safety Act to require an operator of a motor vehicle to provide his name and address. The accused had admitted that the statement given was voluntary. Although there had been no identification in Court, the officer had seen the accused operating a motor vehicle and had properly obtained his name and date of birth. That person was arrested and released on an appearance notice. Counsel for the accused appeared on the scheduled date and entered a guilty plea and then appeared on the trial date and the accused was noted as present. All of these facts constituted prima facie proof of identity. Regarding the other issues, the Court held that notice under s. 260(6) of the Code can be given to counsel of record without proof that counsel consented to the receipt of such notice. However, the Crown had not established that proper notice was given either to the accused or his counsel as required by s. 260(5), either by way of viva voce or affidavit evidence from the person effecting service or an admission of counsel. Without such compliance with s. 260(6), the certificate was not admissible in evidence. There was no other evidence of disqualification and no evidence as to the nature of the disqualification on which the Court could conclude that a s. 259 offence had been committed."
HELD: The Court held that the exhibits were not entitled to be admitted into the courtroom. The Court found that the accused had not consented to the discovery of the exhibits and that the officer had proceeded to use the assistance request of another officer (who had been assigned to the investigation of the accused's computer) as an amplification evidence. The accused's application to exclude certain evidence discovered by the police during the execution of the search was not allowed to enter into s. 24(2) consideration. The issue of exclusion of evidence pursuant to s.24(2)(a) of the Charter was not determined at the initial voir dire as there had not been any evidence presented of either the nature of the evidence seized nor the location from which it was seized. The evidence was determined to be the principal issue to be decided.,"HELD: The application was allowed in part and the balance of images found on the computer were excluded from the evidence at trial pursuant to s. 24(2) of the Charter. The court found that the evidence found through temporary Internet sites was admissible. The reason for obtaining the warrant was apparently abandoned by the police at the beginning of the search of the computer. The police had no authority to search the computer generally. They were only authorized to look at the Internet history. The search of the non-Internet history was a serious infringement of the accused’s s. 8 Charter right. The temporary files created as a result of the visits on the Internet was evidence of Internet history, and because of this connection, this evidence was not excluded."
