The appeal on the first ground was dismissed, however, because the Crown could rely on the presumption in s. 258(1)(c); the accused had been driving 10 minutes before the stop and within two hours of the breath tests, so whether he was in de facto care and control at the time of the stop was irrelevant and did not result in a miscarriage of justice; 2) there was no evidence of the failure to observe the appellant while the breath tests were administered, nor was there a suggestion of the significance of the failure to do so, therefore, the appeal on that ground was dismissed; 3) the trial judge also addressed the issue of evidence if the 2008 amendments did not apply and the appellant was therefore not prejudiced in this regard. The appellant nonetheless argued that the trial judge erred in law by misapprehending evidence. The appeal court concluded that the trial judge did not err in law because his reasons did not disclose that he failed to consider relevant evidence relating to a material issue;  4) the Crown conceded that the 2008 amendments did not apply retroactively.

The trial judge’s comments strongly suggested that the only expert evidence that would be relevant would be with respect to equipment malfunction and not operator error. The appeal was granted on this ground because the trial judge’s comments were found to compromise trial fairness resulting in an error of law; 5) the s. 9 Charter breach was not raised by the appellant at trial but it was raised in his brief following trial, and therefore the appeal court found that the trial judge was obliged to decide whether or not to consider the issue.

The appeal court found that the trial judge was incorrect in giving a strong message to the unrepresented appellant that there was no point in tendering evidence on the accuracy of the Intoxilyzer results. The trial judge’s comments strongly suggested that the only expert evidence that would be relevant would be with respect to equipment malfunction and not operator error. The appeal was granted on this ground because the trial judge’s comments were found to compromise trial fairness resulting in an error of law; 5) the s. 9 Charter breach was not raised by the appellant at trial but it was raised in his brief following trial, and therefore the appeal court found that the trial judge was obliged to decide whether or not to consider the issue. The appeal was also allowed on this ground because the trial judge did not comply with his duty to consider the issue and the appeal court could not determine whether the failure to give reasons resulted in a miscarriage of justice; and 6) there was no issue of trial fairness. The appeal court concluded that there would be prejudice to the integrity of the justice system that would be manifested if the appellant had a fourth trial. Nine and a half years passed since the offence date and the facts of the case were less serious than some drinking and driving cases. Also, there was no other remedy available to remedy the wrong. The balancing of interests also led the court to conclude that this was one of those clearest of cases calling for a stay of proceedings.","The appellant was convicted of having care or control of a motor vehicle while his blood alcohol content exceeded 80 milligrams of alcohol in 100 millilitres of blood, contrary to s. 253(b) of the Criminal Code. He appealed his conviction. Corrigendum received dated March 6, 2015 and added to fulltext. HELD: The appeal was granted.  1) Given that the presumption of care and control was rebutted, the trial judge next considered whether the accused had 'de facto control' as defined by Boudreault (2012 SKPC 129), [2012] SCR 157, and found that he did. 2) The trial judge found that even if he was wrong in concluding that the appellant did not provide evidence to the contrary so as to rebut the presumption in s. 258(1)(c)(iv) so as rebutting the statutory presumption of accuracy, he had no reasonable doubt as to the guilt of the accused. The Court of Appeal allowed the appeal from the bench and, rather than ordering a fourth trial, stayed the proceedings.","He has appealed that conviction pursuant to s. 813 of the Criminal Code. The readings achieved on both the roadside instrument and the subsequent Intoxilyzer readings simply could have not been obtained by the consumption of one or two beer while stopped at the roadside in the manner the accused described. [16] In my respectful opinion, the learned trial judge’s reasons disclose that he applied the wrong legal test as to de facto care and control. Further, given that he did so less than two hours before the administration of the Intoxilyzer test, the Crown was entitled to rely on the presumptions in s. 258(1)(c) of the Criminal Code to prove that the appellant’s blood alcohol level was the same at the time of the offence as that disclosed by the breath tests. As such, the fact that the learned trial judge committed an error of law in relation to the test to be applied in determining whether the appellant had care and control after the appellant stopped did not result in a substantial wrong or miscarriage of justice. The appeal on this ground is accordingly dismissed. The appeal on this ground is accordingly dismissed. Accordingly, the appellant was not prejudiced by the trial judge’s error of law. [30] That said, it is my view that the trial judge’s reasons do not disclose an error within the meaning of the third part of the test outlined in Morrissey.  That is, they do not disclose that the trial judge failed to consider relevant evidence relating to a material issue which played an essential part in the reasoning process which resulted in the conviction. This unrepresented accused was given a very strong message by the learned trial judge that there was no point in leading evidence in an attempt to challenge the accuracy of the Intoxylizer results. Further, and although the learned trial judge initially referred to the fact that the appellant could prove either equipment malfunction or operator error, his comments, taken as a whole, strongly suggest that the only expert evidence that would have been relevant would be evidence relating to equipment malfunction. [51] In these circumstances, it would be inappropriate to hold the appellant responsible for the failure to press the issue of operator error, or to refuse relief because he did not do so. [52] In the result, it is my respectful opinion that the trial judge’s comments compromised trial fairness, thereby resulting in an error of law within the meaning of s. 686(1)(a)(ii) of the Criminal Code. The appeal is accordingly granted on this ground. [56] However, this is not a case where the alleged Charter breach was first raised on appeal. In the result, the appeal should be allowed on this ground as well. [73] In this case, it is my view that there would be prejudice to the integrity of the justice system that would be manifested or aggravated if the appellant is tried a fourth time. [76] To the extent that there is any doubt remaining, it is also my view that the balancing of interests called for by the third test confirms that this is one of those “clearest of cases” which call for a stay of proceedings. [77] The appeal is allowed, and it is hereby ordered that the proceedings against the appellant are stayed. Further, given that he did so less than two hours before the administration of the Intoxilyzer test, the Crown was entitled to rely on the presumptions in s. 258(1)(c) of the Criminal Code to prove that the appellant’s blood alcohol level was the same at the time of the offence as that disclosed by the breath tests. As such, the fact that the learned trial judge committed an error of law in relation to the test to be applied in determining whether the appellant had care and control after the appellant stopped did not result in a substantial wrong or miscarriage of justice. Rather, it is quite clear, based on the evidence as a whole - including the appellant\'s admissions as to when he drove to the grid road - that the appellant had care and control, not more than approximately ten minutes before he was first approached by the police. The appeal on this ground is accordingly dismissed.",0.08978675645342313,"The appellant was convicted of having care or control of a motor vehicle while his blood alcohol content exceeded 80 milligrams of alcohol in 100 millilitres of blood, contrary to s. 253(b) of the Criminal Code.

5_2007skca90.txt,"These appeals concern a referendum on the question of whether the University of Saskatchewan Student's Union should join the Canadian Federation of Students (the Federation). The referendum was held in the fall of 2005. A majority of the students voted in favour of joining the Federation. The respondent Robin Mowat then applied to the Court of Queen's Bench pursuant to The Non-profit Corporations Act (the Act) and obtained an order declaring the referendum to be of no force or effect. The Federation and the Student's Union now seek to overturn that order. They argue that Mowat had no standing to bring his application and that the Chambers judge erred in his application of the relevant statutory provisions. HELD: The appeals must be dismissed. 1) The respondent is a 'proper person' to bring the application pursuant s. 222(d) of the Act. He was attending the University and very actively involved on campus and the referendum campaign. Over 44% of the students voted against joining the Federation. The Act gives the right to make an application to a complainant, not to a complainant who speaks for a significant portion of the members of a corporation. The fact that the respondent's application was argued a few months after the respondent had convocated should not defeat his right to bring his concerns forward. An individual's status as a student is inevitably temporary. There is no justice in denying the respondent's standing only because the process for reviewing the referendum results played out so slowly that he was unable to bring the matter before a court prior to the date of his convocation.  2) The Controverted election cases are not applicable in the circumstances of this case. Section 225 of the Act creates and delimits a statutory remedy for particular kinds of corporate conduct. The assessment of an application pursuant to s. 225 of the Act must be measured against the concepts of oppression, unfair prejudice and unfair disregard as provided in that section. Administrative law concepts should be imported into that analysis only with considerable care and only for the purpose of giving meaning to the statutory terms found in the section itself. 3) The critical point is that the Council abandoned a formal process which had been put in place specifically to address the very significant concerns raised by the respondent and other about the referendum. Whether that turn of events was somehow inevitable is not the real issue. Rather, the essence of this case is the unfairness and prejudice the Council's decision involved for those who had opposed joining the Federation.

What the verdict would have been, absent the trial judge's consideration of the certificate, is not clear. The matter must be resolved in favour of the accused.

The evidence as to the accused's pattern of driving, his unsteadiness and fumbling, coupled with his admissions and the odour of alcohol are matters which, if accepted by a properly instructed finder of facts, could have resulted in conviction.","[1] On March 16, 2003, the appellant was charged, firstly, with operating a motor vehicle while his ability was impaired by alcohol under ss. 255(1) and 253(a) of the Criminal Code of Canada and, secondly, with having consumed alcohol in such a quantity that his blood alcohol level exceeded .08 contrary to ss. 253(b) and 255(1) of the Criminal Code. An initial question therefore is whether the trial judge’s decision quoted above reflects a conviction on both counts or a conviction only for impaired driving. The entry of a judicial stay on the .08 charge was not used by the trial judge to avoid a multiple conviction issue. Consequently, I am obliged to resolve the matter in favour of the accused, and the conviction is set aside. [21] As noted above, however, I am of the opinion that the remaining admissible evidence could have resulted in a like verdict so rather than direct an acquittal, it is appropriate to order a new trial.

The accused was convicted of impaired driving. An initial question is whether the trial judge's decision reflected a conviction on both counts or a conviction only for the impaired driving charge. HELD: The appeal is allowed and the conviction is set aside with an order that a new trial be held. 1) The court found a conviction was not entered on the .08 charge and the judicial stay was not used by the trial judge to avoid a multiplicity of convictions. 2) There was an error in law in that the trial judge relied at least in part on the certificate readings for his conclusion of impairment.

The Board decided that the appellant purchased the documentation independent of the valves and were subject to tax under ss.5(9) unless exempted under ss.8(1)(f). The parties agreed the documents fell within the definition of tangible property as set out in the Act. At issue was the interpretation by the Board of the word 'published' as used in ss.5(1)(b) of eg. 1 when defining the word 'books' and whether the drawings were exempt from tax. HELD: The appeal was allowed and the decision of the Board reversed. Costs were awarded to the appellant. 1)The role of the Court was in the nature of judicial review and supervisory in nature.

e_2004skqb372.txt,"This is an appeal by the City of Regina (the City) and Canadian Union of Public Employees Local 21 (CUPE) from a decision of the Tribunal under The Saskatchewan Human Rights Code (the Code) in the matter of complaints filed by the respondent against the City and CUPE. It became clear that the main issues on the appeal were the duty to accommodate and the alleged resignation of the respondent. The respondent filed a complaint under Part II of the Code alleging that CUPE and the City discriminated against him on the basis of his disability. The Commission substantiated this allegation before the Tribunal by showing there was a discriminatory impact on the respondent as a result of the seniority system established by the collective agreements in force from time to time between the City and CUPE. The Tribunal found that all of the efforts made in response to the respondent did not deal directly and effectively with his claim that the seniority standards in the collective agreement were discriminatory towards him on the basis of his disability. The Tribunal agreed with the Commission that their efforts were too little too late to reverse the systemic discrimination. The accommodations did not meet the duty to accommodate short of undue hardship. The Tribunal found that the City and CUPE contravened s. 16 and s. 18(1) of the Code by discriminating against the respondent on the basis of his disability. HELD: The appeals by the City and CUPE on liability are dismissed. The parties were allowed to refer the issue of damages to the Tribunal. 1) The superior expertise of human rights tribunal is confined to fact finding and decision making in the context of human rights and therefore reasonableness is the test for judicial review. If the issue is one of law, the standard of review is one of correctness. In other words, the appropriate standard of review by superior court of factual determination is whether the decision is patently unreasonable. Where human rights commission is required to interpret laws of general application, the correctness test applies. 2) The Court agreed with the Commission that the seniority system prevented a person such as the respondent from ever getting a permanent position, without accommodation, by giving priority to all those who could work more hours or gain permanent status by being flexible enough to work at the wide range of positions that the City had to offer. The respondent could not take advantage of this reward system because he could only bid into truck driver positions. The City and CUPE were too late in developing the plan. The plan was conceived in early 1999 to be executed when the respondent reached the top of the seniority list, probably in about 2000. But by this time, he was unable to work. 3) The characterization of the order of the Tribunal is not to direct the respondent be given a permanent position despite the seniority rights of others. It is to give him the benefits he would have had if his seniority had accrued in a non-discriminatory manner. 4) Whether CUPE had knowledge of the problem is irrelevant. The breach occurs as soon as there is discrimination. The City and CUPE are jointly responsible where a collective bargaining agreement that they negotiated is discriminatory. 5) For either the City or CUPE to avoid liability they must discharge their duty to accommodate up to the point of undue hardship. 6) The Tribunal's finding that there was no undue hardship is supported by the evidence. There are approximately 1,400 casual and permanent positions. Moving the respondent up the seniority list would have relegated certain union members in a large bargaining unit by one, which is insignificant. If this occurred, although the respondent would obtain the next permanent position, this would not be in disregard of the rights of other employees. Neither the City nor CUPE presented any evidence that would establish that a retroactive adjustment itself would create an undue hardship in the context that it would cause the seniority list to become unmanageable or ambiguous. It is not without significance that even if the membership of CUPE opposed the placing of the respondent into a permanent position, this by itself does not justify a finding of undue hardship. 7) The mandate of the Tribunal, once a finding of discrimination is made, is to determine what losses are caused by the discriminatory conduct. The Tribunal found that the respondent's resignation was one effect of the discrimination. The Court found there was no merit to this ground of appeal.","HELD: The appeal was dismissed. The tribunal found that the City was not prejudiced by the considerable time that has elapsed since the complaint took place; the tribunal also found that it was not responsible for the discrimination against the applicant. The applicant had been a casual employee for 16 years and had been employed by the City for 15 years. He had received 4% less in wages than other city employees because of his disability; the court also compensated the applicant in the amount of $8,902.00.","[1] This is an appeal by the City of Regina (the “City”) and Canadian Union of Public Employees Local 21 (“CUPE”) from a decision dated October 10, 2003, of Roger J. F. LePage, sitting as a Tribunal (the “Tribunal”) under The Saskatchewan Human Rights Code, S.S. 1979, c. S-24.1 (the “Code”), in the matter of complaints filed by Gary Wayne Kivela (“Mr. Kivela”), against his employer the City. [6] Mr. Kivela filed a complaint under Part II of the Code, alleging that CUPE discriminated against him on the basis of his disability. The Commission substantiated this allegation before the Tribunal by showing that there was a discriminatory impact on Mr. Kivela as a result of the seniority system established by the collective agreements in force from time to time between the City and CUPE. While not disregarding the efforts of the Respondents going to great lengths to accommodate Mr. Kivela, I agree with the Human Rights Commission that their efforts of accommodation were “too little, too late” to reverse the systemic discrimination experienced by Mr. Kivela over the years. 117. In conclusion I find that the City of Regina and the Canadian Union of Public Employees, Local 21 contravened sections 16 and 18(1) of the Code by discriminating against the complainant Mr. Kivela on the basis of his disability. [61] I agree with the Commission that in effect, the seniority system prevented a person such a Mr. Kivela from ever getting a permanent position, without accommodation, by giving priority to all those who could work more hours or gain permanent status by being flexible enough to work at the wide range of positions that the City had to offer. [64] Here, the characterization of the order of the Tribunal is not to direct that Mr. Kivela be given a permanent position despite the seniority rights of others. It is to give Mr. Kivela the benefits he would have had if his seniority had accrued in a non‑discriminatory manner.

The employer and CUPE are jointly responsible where a collective bargaining agreement that they negotiated is discriminatory.

It became clear that the main issues on the appeal were the duty to accommodate and the alleged resignation of the respondent. The respondent filed a complaint under Part II of the Code alleging that CUPE and the City discriminated against him on the basis of his disability. The Commission substantiated this allegation before the Tribunal by showing there was a discriminatory impact on the respondent as a result of the seniority system established by the collective agreements in force from time to time between the City and CUPE. The Tribunal found that all of the efforts made in response to the respondent did not deal directly and effectively with his claim that the seniority standards in the collective agreement were discriminatory towards him on the basis of his disability. The Tribunal agreed with the Commission that their efforts were too little too late to reverse the systemic discrimination. The accommodations did not meet the duty to accommodate short of undue hardship.

The respondent claimed that the City had discriminated against him on the basis of his disability. The tribunal found that the respondent had made his complaint within the Code's limitation period and that, because of this disability, he was not prejudiced by the considerable time that has elapsed since the complaint took place. HELD: The appeal was dismissed with costs. 1)The tribunal failed to take into account the respondent's disability or the fact that he was a casual employee in the City. It was impossible for the respondent to gain employment with the City because the entry-level position was something he could not do because of his disabilities. The requirement of building up seniority as a driver presented an insurmountable barrier for the petitioner because of the entry level position and he received 4% less in wages than other comparable City employees. The wage differential was inappropriate and the respondent was compensated in the amount of $8,902.00. 2)The respondent's numerous attempts to gain permanent status over the years were unsuccessful. His frustration with the city and CUPE heightened once he became aware of other casual employees, hired after him, who passed the respondent on the seniority list and then assigned him as permanent employee to drive tandem truck. The decision was based on an informal arrangement whereby casual employees were given priority over permanent employees in bidding for any permanent position, amongst those who were qualified. The City was able to accommodate the respondent by allowing him to move between truck driving duties.

The plaintiffs brought a claim in contract and tort alleging Hagblom caused a fire in their building. The third party claim alleged negligence by the city's fire department in managing the fire and in the post-fire investigation. The third parties argued that, subject to their duty to act in good faith, they could not be found liable to the defendants in negligence. In issue was whether s.136.1(2) of the Urban Municipality Act and s.34 of the Fire Prevention Act prevented the defendants from taking proceedings against the third parties; whether certain paragraphs should be struck on the basis the common law does not recognize a cause of action for spoiled or destroyed evidence and failure to assist in gathering evidence on the basis the third parties did not owe a statutory duty to the defendants; whether certain paragraphs should be struck as the defendants had not obtained leave to bring third party proceedings as required by s.7 of the Contributory Negligence Act.

It is arguable on the pleadings that the fire department failed to properly fight the fire, and that they omitted certain actions prior to the fire that supposedly contributed to its spread. 4) The essence of the claim is that every allegation of fact in the Statement of Claim is true, even if it appears to be very unlikely allegation that will be difficult to prove.

At issue was whether Hyndman had an obligation in contract or equity for the lease payments and repairs from September 1993 until February 1994 based on discussions in 1993. There was no correspondence between the parties confirming the terms of the agreement. It was agreed that the discussions concerned the fact that Standard was not solvent at that date and that Hyndman entered an arrangement with Standard to operate under Hyndman's authority; Hyndman would make payments but would not agree to having the leases assigned to them. In issue was for how long the lease payments were to continue and on what conditions. HELD: The action against Hyndman was dismissed with taxable costs. Standard did not enter a defence to Redhead's claim and had been noted in default. Judgment was entered against Standard for $63,267.49 for the outstanding lease payments and parts and service account plus pre-judgment interest calculated from March 1994 to the date of judgment pursuant to the Pre-judgment Interest Act. 1)Redhead's claim against Hyndman was dismissed as there was no contractual relationship between the companies respecting the lease payments.

It was clear that Hyndman refused to assume the obligations on the leases; that Redhead knew of the risk because of Standard's insolvency and was prepared to take that risk. 2)The facts did not establish appropriate circumstances for an award based on either quantum meruit or unjust enrichment. The actions taken were for the benefit of Standard in an attempt to keep it operational.  3)The claim against Hyndman for unpaid repairs was not proven. Hyndman did make some payments on behalf of Standard for repairs although there was no specific contract to do so.  It was not established that the accounts were forwarded, that Hyndman had notice of the unpaid invoices or issued a purchase order number authorizing the repairs. Hyndman gave notice to Redhead that they would not be obligated for repairs without a purchase order number.","HELD: The Court dismissed the plaintiff's claim for breach of contract for the outstanding lease payments on the vehicles and for the repairs to them for the period from September 1, 1993 until February 11, 1994. The defendant, Hyndman Transport (1972) Limited, shall have its taxable costs.

(""Standard"") and Hyndman Transport (1972) Limited (""Hyndman"") with respect to amounts owing for payments on vehicles leased by Standard from Redhead and for parts and labour supplied by Redhead to these leased vehicles. [10] It is clear, however, from Cox’s notes and Duda’s evidence at the trial that, (a) Hyndman would not assume the obligations on the Redhead and Standard leases, and (b) that Redhead knew at that meeting that there was a risk to the arrangement because of Standard’s insolvency and that Redhead might not be paid on the leases. Contract [12] On the evidence as a whole it is apparent that there was no contractual relationship between the parties, Redhead and Hyndman, with respect to the lease payments. [14] The plaintiff’s claim against the defendant, Hyndman, with respect to the leases is therefore dismissed. [17] The facts of this case, however, do not satisfy me on a balance of probabilities that this is an appropriate circumstance for an award in favour of the plaintiff based on either quantum meruit or unjust enrichment. [19] The plaintiff’s claim on this ground is also dismissed. On the issue of the unpaid invoices, the plaintiff\'s evidence does not establish that Hyndman had notice of the invoices, or that there was a purchase order number obtained from Hyndman authorizing the repairs. In fact the evidence indicates that Hyndman gave notice to Redhead that they would not be obligated for repairs without a purchase order number once they realized there may have been a misapprehension by Standard’s creditors with respect to the payment of these accounts. [22] I therefore find that the plaintiff\'s claim with respect to the unpaid repairs against Hyndman has not been proven and that portion of the claim is also dismissed. [24] There being no defence entered to the claim by Redhead against Standard and the defendant, Standard, having been noted for default, judgment is therefore given against them in the amount of the plaintiff\'s claim for:

(a) damages for breach of contract for the outstanding lease payments and the outstanding parts and service account in the total amount of $63,267.49;

(b) pre-judgment interest to be calculated from March 28, 1994, to the date of judgment pursuant to The Pre-Judgment Interest Act, S.S. 1984-85-86, c. P-22.2;

At issue was whether Hyndman had an obligation in contract or equity for the lease payments and repairs from September 1993 until February 1994 based on discussions in 1993. There was no correspondence between the parties confirming the terms of the agreement. It was agreed that the discussions concerned the fact that Standard was not solvent at that date and that Hyndman entered an arrangement with Standard to operate under Hyndman's authority; Hyndman would make payments but would not agree to having the leases assigned to them. In issue was for how long the lease payments were to continue and on what conditions. HELD: The action against Hyndman was dismissed with taxable costs. Standard did not enter a defence to Redhead's claim and had been noted in default. Judgment was entered against Standard for $63,267.49 for the outstanding lease payments and parts and service account plus pre-judgment interest calculated from March 1994 to the date of judgment pursuant to the Pre-judgment Interest Act. 1)Redhead's claim against Hyndman was dismissed as there was no contractual relationship between the companies respecting the lease payments. Any verbal arrangement was never verified. It was clear that Hyndman refused to assume the obligations on the leases; that Redhead knew of the risk because of Standard's insolvency and was prepared to take that risk. 2)The facts did not establish appropriate circumstances for an award based on either quantum meruit or unjust enrichment.

The issues include what amounts, if any, are to be added to the sources of income set out in the father's total income in his T1 General form to come to the appropriate level of income for the purpose of calculating child maintenance payments. HELD: 1) The father's income has fluctuated significantly in the last years, and the inherent nature of farming is such that it is more appropriate in the circumstances to this operation to use year average. 2) Non-arm's length salary will be added back into income unless the father established that payments were necessary and reasonable. In 2004 the amount of salary paid to the mother for bookkeeping was $5,000. It would appear that the $15,000 paid in 2003 was means of splitting income. $5,000 appears to be reasonable amount. 3) Some of the personal expenses claimed as farm expenses such as electricity, home heat, telephone, meals and office expenses should be added back to income. The father has added back portion of these expenses based on certain percentages being allocated to personal use. It has not been established that more amounts need to be added back. 4) The majority of the capital cost allowance on personal property owned by the father relates to his motor vehicle. He states the personal use of his truck is 10%. The full amount claimed for capital cost allowance is not necessary for the replacement of the vehicle. This along with significant personal use of the vehicle makes it reasonable to add back 50% of the capital cost allowance claimed in each of the years in question. 5) The mother has asked that the Court add back to the father's personal income the amounts claimed in the partnership and then allocated to the individual partners. The father's income tax return includes personal farm component which consists of much smaller income and expense statement on matters that are totally within his control and for which all benefits accrue to him. His tax return also includes the partnership statement which shows the same types of income and expenses but on partnership basis. There are five partners involved, two are his brothers and the other two are his cousins. There is no evidence to suggest that the income statements of the partnership are fashioned in such way to reflect an inaccurate picture on cash basis of the operation of the farm partnership. There is nothing to suggest that the partnership is organizing its expenses or distribution to artificially lower the income of the father. This is not situation where the father is the sole shareholder in corporation. This is not situation in which there is majority ownership in the partnership which would allow the father to control the activities of income distribution or asset purchase. There is nothing in the Guidelines to suggest that the Court should be adding back any of the partnership amounts to the income of the father automatically. There is nothing in the evidence that would lead the Court to the conclusion capital cost allowance being claimed by partnership is inappropriate or indeed that any of the expenses or accounting functions used by the partnership do not reflect the partnership business over the long term. The Court was not prepared to add back to the income of the father the personal expenses claimed in partnership returns as farm expenses, capital cost allowance on real property or personal property owned by the partnership. 6) The total income averaged over 3 years comes to $29,983 each year. Child maintenance shall be paid on that amount.","The parties met, married, made children and then separated. The petitioner mother has custody of the three children. She is employed with a local auctioneer. The respondent father, before, during and after the relationship, is part of a farming partnership with two brothers and two cousins. They have not settled a division of matrimonial property. Issues [1] What amounts, if any, are to be added to the father's total income to come to the appropriate level of income for the purpose of calculating child maintenance? HELD: The Court found that in 2003, 2004 and 2005 the income of the father was $29,983. In 2003, the total amount of child maintenance was $5,000. In 2004, the father had been making the maintenance payments as ordered. In 2005, the majority of the claim by the father in this regard relates to his motor vehicle. He acknowledges portion of the vehicle is used for personal use and states that portion to be 10 percent. The mother says that the portions claimed as personal use should be 50 percent. Evidence was led that the father used the vehicle to efficiently combine personal and business use whenever he could. In looking at the last three years in total, the truck cost was listed at $23,283 with depreciation taken of $18,855 to date. The father testified that he intends to use the truck for a further significant period of time. The full amount claimed for capital cost allowance is not necessary for the replacement. This along with significant personal use makes it reasonable to add back 50% of the capital cost of allowance claimed in each of the years in question which will result in an addition to income in 2003 of $2,882; in 2004, $3,829; in 2005, $1,733; and in 2006, $4,733. The Court awarded the petitioner mother $24,300. The parties have approached this case on the basis that the most representative and fairest method of determining this self-employed father's income is a three-year average under s. 17 of the Federal Child Support Guidelines. The analysis here is substantially different than that contained in the father’s personal farming statement. Each party achieved partial success in their approach to the issue of maintenance. The case law which focuses on the reasonableness of the expense as it relates to capital cost and alleged personal expenses claimed on partnership returns acknowledges that these are legitimate expenses used to reduce income unless it is shown that they are unnecessary or unreasonable.","(a) The respondent’s income is determined to be $29,983, and he shall pay to the petitioner for the support of Reidar Knudson, born December 18, 1998, and Bronwyn Knudson and Kadence Knudson, both born August 9, 2000, the sum of $568.00 per month commencing October 1, 2005, and continuing every month thereafter until a child is no longer a child within the meaning of the Divorce Act, R.S.C. 1985, c. 3 (2nd Supp.), provided that if he has overpaid child maintenance to this date, he may offset the overpayment against future maintenance payments but only to the extent of $50.00 per month so that the maintenance actually paid will not drop below $518.00 per month until the overpayment has been extinguished.",0.05072463768115943,"The respondent father is part of farming partnership with two brothers and two cousins running mixed grain and cattle operation.

Issues [1] What amounts, if any, are to be added to the sources of income set out in the father's total income in his T1 General form to come to the appropriate level of income for the purpose of calculating child maintenance payments? HELD: 1) The respondent's income is determined to be $29,983. He will be in a small credit position which he can offset against ongoing maintenance but in amount no greater than $50 per month so as not to cause any inappropriate financial hardship on the children. When arrears by the payor occur, this Court often allows those payments to be paid monthly. See no reason why the overpayment by a payor should not be treated in the same fashion in these circumstances.  2) Personal expenses claimed in partnership returns as farm expenses (vi) Capital cost allowance on real property owned by the partnership; and (vii) capital cost allowance have been claimed for personal use for three years. The father testified he intends to use the truck for a further significant period of time. The mother's request to add back half of the respondent's personal income the amounts claimed in the partnership and then allocated to the individual partners was substantially different than that contained in his personal farming statement. It appears that the more appropriate amount would be $5,000. In 2003, the income of the petitioner was $24,300. In 2004, the respondent was in a smaller credit position, but he could offset against continuing maintenance but only to the extent of $50 so that the maintenance actually paid will not drop below $518 per month until the over payment has been extinguished. In 2005, the majority of the claim by the respondent in this regard relates to his motor vehicle. He acknowledges that a portion of the vehicle is used as personal use. However, the mother testified that she intended to use it for further personal use whenever she could. She claimed the vehicle was used for 'personal use whenever possible'. The respondent will be able to offset against any ongoing maintenance payments but in the amount no higher than $60 per month. The capital cost allowances on real and private property are non-subsidized childcare and the health and medical costs in excess of $100 per annum are not included in the calculation of s. expense payments. The parties have approached this case on the basis that","(a) The respondent’s income is determined to be $29,983, and he shall pay to the petitioner for the support of Reidar Knudson, born December 18, 1998, and Bronwyn Knudson and Kadence Knudson, both born August 9, 2000, the sum of $568.00 per month commencing October 1, 2005, and continuing every month thereafter until a child is no longer a child within the meaning of the Divorce Act, R.S.C. 1985, c. 3 (2nd Supp.), provided that if he has overpaid child maintenance to this date, he may offset the overpayment against future maintenance payments but only to the extent of $50.00 per month so that the maintenance actually paid will not drop below $518.00 per month until the overpayment has been extinguished.",0.14462081128747795,"The respondent father is part of farming partnership with two brothers and two cousins running mixed grain and cattle operation. Division of the matrimonial property is at issue. The issues include what amounts, if any, are to be added to the sources of income set out in the father's total income in his T1 General form to come to the appropriate level of income for the purpose of calculating child maintenance payments. HELD: 1) The father's income has fluctuated significantly in the last years, and the inherent nature of farming is such that it is more appropriate in the circumstances to this operation to use year average. 2) Non-arm's length salary will be added back into income unless the father established that payments were necessary and reasonable. In 2004 the amount of salary paid to the mother for bookkeeping was $5,000. It would appear that the $15,000 paid in 2003 was means of splitting income. $5,000 appears to be reasonable amount. 3) Some of the personal expenses claimed as farm expenses such as electricity, home heat, telephone, meals and office expenses should be added back to income. The father has added back portion of these expenses based on certain percentages being allocated to personal use. It has not been established that more amounts need to be added back. 4) The majority of the capital cost allowance on personal property owned by the father relates to his motor vehicle. He states the personal use of his truck is 10%. The full amount claimed for capital cost allowance is not necessary for the replacement of the vehicle. This along with significant personal use of the vehicle makes it reasonable to add back 50% of the capital cost allowance claimed in each of the years in question. 5) The mother has asked that the Court add back to the father's personal income the amounts claimed in the partnership and then allocated to the individual partners. The father's income tax return includes personal farm component which consists of much smaller income and expense statement on matters that are totally within his control and for which all benefits accrue to him. His tax return also includes the partnership statement which shows the same types of income and expenses but on partnership basis. There are five partners involved, two are his brothers and the other two are his cousins. There is no evidence to suggest that the income statements of the partnership are fashioned in such way to reflect an inaccurate picture on cash basis of the operation of the farm partnership. There is nothing to suggest that the partnership is organizing its expenses or distribution to artificially lower the income of the father. This is not situation where the father is the sole shareholder in corporation. This is not situation in which there is majority ownership in the partnership which would allow the father to control the activities of income distribution or asset purchase. There is nothing in the Guidelines to suggest that the Court should be adding back any of the partnership amounts to the income of the father automatically. There is nothing in the evidence that would lead the Court to the conclusion capital cost allowance being claimed by partnership is inappropriate or indeed that any of the expenses or accounting functions used by the partnership do not reflect the partnership business over the long term. The Court was not prepared to add back to the income of the father the personal expenses claimed in partnership returns as farm expenses, capital cost allowance on real property or personal property owned by the partnership. 6) The total income averaged over 3 years comes to $29,983 each year. Child maintenance shall be paid on that amount.","The parties met, married, made children and then separated. The respondent father is part of a farming partnership with two brothers and two cousins. They have not settled a division of matrimonial property. Issues [1] What amounts, if any, are to be added to the sources of income set out in the father's total income in his T1 General form to come to the appropriate level of income for the purpose of calculating child maintenance payments? HELD: 1) The respondent's income is determined to be $29,983. He will be in a small credit position which he can offset against ongoing maintenance but in amount no greater than $50 per month so as not to cause any inappropriate financial hardship on the children. When arrears by the payor occur, this Court often allows those payments to be paid monthly. See no reason why the overpayment by a payor should not be treated in the same fashion in these circumstances.  2) Personal expenses claimed in partnership returns as farm expenses (vi) Capital cost allowance on real property owned by the partnership; and (vii) capital cost allowance have been claimed for personal use for three years. The father testified he intends to use the truck for a further significant period of time. The mother's request to add back half of the respondent's personal income the amounts claimed in the partnership and then allocated to the individual partners was substantially different than that contained in his personal farming statement. It appears that the more appropriate amount would be $5,000. In 2003, the income of the petitioner was $24,300. In 2004, the respondent was in a smaller credit position, but he could offset against continuing maintenance but only to the extent of $50 so that the maintenance actually paid will not drop below $518 per month until the over payment has been extinguished. In 2005, the majority of the claim by the respondent in this regard relates to his motor vehicle. He acknowledges that a portion of the vehicle is used as personal use. However, the mother testified that she intended to use it for further personal use whenever she could. She claimed the vehicle was used for 'personal use whenever possible'. The respondent will be able to offset against any ongoing maintenance payments but in the amount no higher than $60 per month.

d_1991canlii4237.txt,"In this divorce action the petitioner sought to have a separation agreement entered into by the parties incorporated into the corollary relief judgment. The respondent sought to have the separation agreement set aside on the grounds of duress, undue influence or unconscionsability. The couple had a traditional marriage. The petitioner earned $48,000 per year. The wife did not work outside the home and suffered from severe arthritis. For the petitioner and incorporating into the agreement an added provision addressing the respondent's need for drug coverage, that there was nothing unduly harsh about the agreement which would justify setting it aside. The evidence indicated that the respondent had received independent legal advice and she did not establish that she had been dominated by the petitioner to the extent that her signature would have been induced by undue influence or duress. The court determined that the respondent would be far worse off if the agreement was set aside and an equal division ordered.","A divorce and matrimonial property hearing was held. The parties were married in 1960 and separated in 1989. They had two children, aged 18 and 19 years of age. At the conclusion of the hearing and oral argument, the parties agreed that there was no possibility of reconciliation with a permanent breakdown of the marriage as evidenced by the fact that the parties had been living separate and apart for at least one year prior to the hearing. The court found that there were no factors that had been established under s. 13 of the Matrimonial Property Act to warrant an equal division. The respondent sought an order setting aside the separation agreement so as to increase the maintenance provision and at the same time retain the asset division in her favor. HELD: The Court found that the respondent took responsibility for approximately $5,000 indebtedness. It was not an indebtedness that should be taken into account in determining the division of matrimononial assets and liabilities.","Both parties acknowledge having been given the opportunity to obtain independent legal advice, without influence or involvement of the other, and by executing these presents confirm that this clause may constitute a full answer and complete defence to any claim of undue influence, coercion or lack of opportunity for independent advice. The asset division achieved by Mrs. Durocher under the separation agreement is far from being unconscionable, unduly harsh or fraudulent.

The respondent sought to have the separation agreement set aside on the grounds of duress, undue influence or unconscionsability. The couple had a traditional marriage. The petitioner earned $48,000 per year. The wife did not work outside the home and suffered from severe arthritis. For the petitioner and incorporating into the agreement an added provision addressing the respondent's need for drug coverage, that there was nothing unduly harsh about the agreement which would justify setting it aside. The evidence indicated that the respondent had received independent legal advice and she did not establish that she had been dominated by the petitioner to the extent that her signature would have been induced by undue influence or duress. The court determined that the respondent would be far worse off if the agreement was set aside and an equal division ordered.","The parties entered into a separation agreement for the purpose of increasing the maintenance provision and retaining the asset division. The agreement stipulated that the husband should retain the matrimonial home with an equal division of net proceeds if it were to be sold. The husband argued that the agreement should be set aside as a result of the wife's unconscionability and harshness of the previous agreement and that she should have explored using a vehicle as a trade in. Matrimonial Home The parties in their separation agreement indicated that they assumed $60,000 as their gross domestic product at the time of separation. They also agreed that they would not make any claim against the husband's Employee Pension Benefits which they had received as part of the separation agreement. The wife's application for divorce dismissed on the basis that the parties had not entered into the agreement in such a fashion as to require a change in the terms of the contract or agreement as to its maintenance provision. Husband and wife separation agreement set aside; if the court were to find that there were any factors which had been established under s. 13 of the Matrimonial Property Act to warrant such an amount, it would find that it was not subject to review by the court as there were no special circumstances as under the Divorce Act of Nova Scotia.","Both parties acknowledge having been given the opportunity to obtain independent legal advice, without influence or involvement of the other, and by executing these presents confirm that this clause may constitute a full answer and complete defence to any claim of undue influence, coercion or lack of opportunity for independent advice.

The trial judge made no palpable and overriding error in his finding that the father was not in arrears of maintenance and that there would be no order for retroactive child support. Nevertheless, the trial judge was in error in determining that the children were no longer children of the marriage within the meaning of the Act. The matter is remitted to the trial judge to determine the extent to which the father is obligated to pay maintenance for the children after September 2006.  1) The father and daughters did not have a conventional relationship.

The fact that the emphasis of the relationship after 2003 shifted does not imply that they had no meaningful relationship in their own way. The proper conclusion to be drawn from all the evidence of the relationship before September 2006 and the relative silence after that time is that father and daughters were fighting and this mutual fight was prolonged and sustained by the litigation and the intervention of the mother.

The matter is remitted to the trial judge to determine the extent to which the father is obligated to pay maintenance for the children after September 2006.  1) The father and daughters did not have a conventional relationship. The father separated from the mother and daughters early and, since he lived in Hong Kong, could only have a long-distance relationship. The relationship deteriorated in 2006. It would be accurate to describe the daughters as treating their father with disdain. However, this does not necessarily mean that the daughters had withdrawn from the relationship with the father unilaterally. The father could have stayed in contact with the daughters despite the litigation and their failure to provide him with academic records. The father's efforts to contact the daughters were no greater than the daughters' to contact him. The father recognized the financial dependency of the daughters. Their dependency did not end because of the lack of communication. 2) The trial judge placed too much emphasis on the daughters' poor treatment and disdain of the father. His finding that the daughters did not wish to maintain a meaningful relationship with the father misapprehends the evidence respecting the historical and ongoing nature of their relationship. The fact that the emphasis of the relationship after 2003 shifted does not imply that they had no meaningful relationship in their own way. The proper conclusion to be drawn from all the evidence of the relationship before September 2006 and the relative silence after that time is that father and daughters were fighting and this mutual fight was prolonged and sustained by the litigation and the intervention of the mother. This does not mean that they had withdrawn from the relationship with him unilaterally. The high threshold for a finding that it disentitles the daughters to maintenance has not been met.","The mother applied to vary the 1992 maintenance for her daughters, Nicole and Kirsti. She also applied for determination that the father was in arrears of maintenance and that he provide to her years of retroactive child support. The trial judge found that although the mother's efforts to contact the daughter were no greater than those of the daughter's, she was still entitled to maintenance. The father discontinued child support in September 2006. HELD: The appeal was allowed. The court found that the trial judge made no palpable and overriding error in his finding that the daughters did not wish to maintain a relationship with the father and that there was no order for retroactive maintenance. As the mother had not rebutted the father's contention that she had always been entitled to child support, the court held that it would not be just and equitable to require the father to pay the $26,730.54 per month. The fact that the daughter had recently graduated from high school and was employed by the father did not change the fact that she was no longer entitled to support.","Disposition: Appeal Allowed [1] Lori Ann Olszewski (Willick) (the mother) in January 2007 applied to vary an order for maintenance dated January 9, 1992, for her daughters Nicole and Kirsti (the daughters). [2] This appeal is about: (i) whether Nicole and Kirsti, who were over the age of 18, had withdrawn from the father’s charge and were no longer children of the marriage within the meaning of the Divorce Act[1] (the “Act”) and therefore disentitled to maintenance after September 2006 when they attended post-secondary education; and (ii) whether the maintenance the father paid in the past for them was sufficient and appropriate. [3] For the following reasons we have concluded that the learned trial judge made no palpable and overriding error in his finding that the father was not in arrears of maintenance and that there would be no order for retroactive child support. We cannot say that there is any error in principle or significant misapprehension of the evidence with respect to the issue, nor is the finding clearly wrong. [18] In light of the case law, the evidence does not demonstrate that she unilaterally withdrew from her father. His finding that the daughters did not wish to maintain a meaningful relationship with the father misapprehends the evidence respecting the historical and ongoing nature of their relationship. Even if the circumstances as a whole are construed as a unilateral withdrawal by the daughters, the high threshold for a finding that it disentitles the daughters to maintenance has not been met. The matter will be remitted back to the trial judge to determine the extent to which the father is obligated to pay maintenance for Nicole and Kirsti after September of 2006, taking into account s. 3(2) of the Guidelines, either applying the table amount plus s. 7 expenses or, if the Court considers that approach to be inappropriate, an amount that it considers to be appropriate having regard to the conditions and means, needs and other circumstances of the daughters and the financial ability of each of the parties to contribute to the support of the daughters. [44] As indicated at the hearing, the application of the mother for fresh evidence is dismissed.",0.2410071942446043,"The mother applied to vary an order for maintenance for her daughters.

HELD: The appeal was allowed. 1) The trial judge made no palpable and overriding error in his finding that the daughters were no longer children of the marriage within the meaning of the Divorce Act. He found that the daughter had withdrawn from the father's charge and that there was no order or agreement for the father to pay child support in the amount of $3,644.00. 2) The evidence did not show that the mother unilaterally withdrew from the relationship with the father.

The plaintiff did not provide a sufficient evidentiary foundation to establish estoppel by convention as it did not tender the invoices that were paid. Even if such evidence had been led, there was no convincing evidence of detrimental reliance as the plaintiff presented no evidence that it would have turned to alternative and more lucrative work.","Reliable Truck Trailer Inc. is a mobile vehicle and equipment repair company situated in Pense, Saskatchewan.

The plaintiff asks that this Court grant it out of pocket expenses that it incurred in having to retain an expert to give evidence on the issue of a fair and reasonable price to be paid for goods and services. The amount sought was unreasonable. 2) The defendant properly pointed out that this trial had to be adjourned on one occasion because the plaintiff had not adequately prepared and that it had, therefore, incurred the cost of having his expert attend not once but twice. 3) There was no evidence as to how long the supposed 'convention' of paying these assorted costs occurred. The parties were in general agreement that parts which would cost a significant amount would not be purchased by the plaintiff unless it had first discussed the matter with the defendant.

He should be able to comply with this order within 3 years.  1) The bankrupt is 42 years old and a first time bankrupt. He is employed with an excavating company and earns $20 an hour and works as much as 160 hours per week.

However, he still has some funds left with an income level above the Superintendent's Standard for a family of two. 2) His assets are less than $.50 on the dollar.

HELD: The bankrupt is granted an absolute discharge by virtue of s. 172(2) of the Bankruptcy and Insolvency Act. The court found that the bankrupt was evasive, uncooperative and un-attentive to his duties under the BIA and that his practice simply constitutes the routine turn over of inventory in the farming operation.

He should be able to comply with this order within 3 years.  1) The bankrupt is 42 years old and a first time bankrupt. He is employed with an excavating company and earns $20 an hour and works as much as 160 hours per week. He is paying $1,000 per month on his mortgage and is trying to catch up on mortgage arrears to stave off foreclosure. He is working hard and living a subsistence life. However, he still has some funds left with an income level above the Superintendent's Standard for a family of two. 2) His assets are less than $.50 on the dollar. His creditors were put to the unnecessary expense by his frivolous or vexatious defence of their claim and he failed to comply with the duties of a bankrupt by failing to produce proper records and assist the trustee to the fullest. He has been abusive and disrespectful throughout.","The bankrupt applied for his discharge from bankruptcy. His statement of affairs showed assets of $171,255 (mostly exempt or encumbered) against unsecured debts totalling $433,750 and secured debt of $150,000. The bankruptcy judge adjourned the application sine die and fiat issued requiring further disclosure. The bankrupt asserted a security interest over the equity pursuant to s173(1)(d) of the Bankruptcy and Insolvency Act. He argued that the drought, which had occurred five or six years prior to his assignment, had resulted in his inability to grow sufficient feed for his cattle operation and he was forced to purchase cattle feed at great expense. He also claimed that he sold cattle in the year prior to bankruptcy because it simply amounted to a sale of inventory in the ordinary course of business. SCU cross-examined the bankrupt and found him to be evasive, uncooperative and un-attentive to his duties under the BIA and at times verbally abusive. HELD: The bankrupt was granted an absolute discharge by virtue of s172(2) and the appropriate terms of his discharge were set out. 1)The bankrupt was 42 years old. He had one son from a previous relationship who did not reside with him. He was employed with an excavating company earning $20/hr but could only buy cattle at night. His farm and personal accounts were in state of total disarray. He should be able to comply with the conditional order within three years, which is considered an acceptable period of time for a bankrupt to be burdened with a conditional order. The court found that the bankrupt's pattern of breeding and raising cattle with view to selling the calves in the same year constituted the normal course of his farming operation and it made little sense to fault him for selling inventory in that course when it's part of the business operation itself and done for purposes of earning livelihood in a recognized, routine way. 2)In circumstances of significant asset depletion without corresponding satisfactory explanation, the bankrupt failed to meet the onus on him.

The onus is on the objecting creditor to prove the existence of s173 (2)of the Act if it is not otherwise reported by the trustee.

e_2008skca94.txt,"This appeal was brought on a narrow ground from a judgment in the Court of Queen's Bench granting variation of a child support order pursuant to s. 17(1) of the Divorce Act. The appeal challenged the chambers judge's interpretation and application of s. 7(1.1) of the Federal Child Support Guidelines, which defines the term 'extraordinary expenses.' The appellant argued that the chambers judge erred in ordering the appellant to contribute proportionately to the costs associated with the children's extracurricular activities without finding that these were 'extraordinary expenses' within the meaning of the Guidelines. The appellant argued these expenses were ordinary and not extraordinary within the meaning of s. 7(1)(d) and (f) and s. 7(1.1) of the Guidelines. It was the appellant's position that these expenses were covered by the basic child support order which the respondent received tax free, in addition to the appellant's responsibility for 73% of the children's health care and day care expenses. HELD: Appeal dismissed with costs to the respondent. Per Hunter J.A. (Gerwing J.A. concurring): All the information needed to determine the s. 7(1)(f) expenses eligible for proportionate sharing was before the Chambers judge: he knew the total income of the recipient spouse; he knew the previous extracurricular activities and the 11 current extracurricular activities that the children participated in, along with the estimated annual cost. Updated financial statements were filed by both the appellant and respondent. The Chambers judge exercised his discretion and granted an order requiring the appellant to pay his proportionate share (73%) of the extracurricular activities he listed, which is approximately one-half of the children's extracurricular activities. Accordingly, he did not make a palpable and overriding error, nor did he err in law, and his conclusion is supported by the evidence before him on this application. There is no basis to interfere with the decision of the Chambers judge. Per Smith J.A. (in dissent): Significant deference must be given by this Court to the chambers judge in relation to child support orders. This is particularly so to the extent that such orders involve the exercise of discretion. In this case the trial judge erred in law in failing to consider and apply the definition of 'special or extraordinary expenses' in s. 7(1.1) of the Guidelines. First, it is impossible without some evidence, explanation or explicit finding, to understand why even the total of all the children's extracurricular activities would be considered 'extraordinary' in the statutory sense, given the level of child support ordered and the respondent's annual income. There was simply no evidence to support such conclusion. Second, the order did not, in fact, come close to ordering that the appellant pay proportion of half the activities, since it excluded the cost of music lessons for the two older children. In addition, it included the cost of Tae Kwon Do for which there was no evidence at all. In short, such an interpretation lacks any rational basis. Third, it is clear that, up until the argument on the appeal, the parties themselves had interpreted the order more generally, as an order that the appellant pay proportion of all the children's extra-curricular activities. This interpretation certainly makes more sense, for the alternative would require variation in the order, or new agreement, every time the children changed or added activities. It is unlikely that the chambers judge would have confined his order so specifically, absent, of course, an agreement of the parties, or reasonable finding that specific activity constituted an extraordinary expense. The chambers judge erred in failing to consider the definition of extraordinary expenses in s. 7(1.1), or this Court's decision in Ryba v. Schoenroth, and acted without any evidence that the expenses in question constituted extraordinary expenses within the meaning of the Guidelines.

The parties were parents of three children, ages 8, 9 and 10.

c_2002skqb508.txt,"A motion for judicial review of a Labour Relations Board decision awarding a retroactive wage increase to employees. The food services operators, alleging a denial of natural justice and procedural fairness, sought to have the orders set aside on the grounds the decisions were patently unreasonable in that the employer could not afford the wage increases and because retroactivity would not have been a feature of a replicated contract. HELD: The motion was dismissed.  1)In undertaking to replicate a collective bargaining agreement that the parties might have reached, the LRB concluded the contract in 14 months by which time the two year term contract had only three and one-half months to go. The two year contract has now expired and the business has been sold. To elevate this issue to a point where a rehearing would be required would seem counterproductive. 2)The LRB's actions fell well short of substantial compliance with the 45 day limit for review. However at no time was the 'over 45 days' issue raised in the proceedings before the Board. The test of 'substantial compliance' would involve a consideration of the purpose of the 45 day time limit and the probability of prejudice which might arise from a failure to comply. The importance of a retroactive wage increase, which was substantial if viewed as a percentage, would seem prejudicial, even accepting the 45 day limit is directory. The employer sought and obtained an adjournment of the hearing in April which effectively made compliance with the 45 day limit impossible as the employees left once they graduated from their university courses. 3)The errors were not so severe or so obvious as to meet the standard of patently unreasonable as defined by the courts (ie. clearly irrational (Federal Court of Appeal), outrageous, absurd, ridiculous, so beyond the bound of reason as to amount to fraud on the law or deliberate refusal to comply with it (Southam)). 4)The decision to allow employees, who had graduated and left their employment to receive back pay, was not of sufficient import to justify a finding of breach of natural justice. Whether the Board breached natural justice and procedural fairness by awarding retroactive wages depends on whether the issue was one of the points of dispute between the parties. To set aside the entire process because the retroactivity issue was not front and centre in the preliminary discussions would seem contrary to reason and curial deference. Had the raise in pay not been retroactive it would, in light of the late decision, been rather meaningless.","The Saskatchewan Labour Relations Board awarded a wage increase to employees of Four Star Management Ltd., operators of certain food services. The wage increase was part of first collective bargaining agreement concluded by the Board after the normal bargaining between the parties failed. The employer sought and obtained an adjournment of the hearing in April 2000 which effectively made compliance with the 45 day limit impossible. HELD: The motion was dismissed. 1)The question of whether the Board breached natural justice and procedural fairness by awarding retroactive wages was of sufficient import to justify a finding of breach of natural justice. 2)The employer sought an order setting aside the orders of the Board upon the grounds that their decisions are patently unreasonable in that the employer could not afford the wage increases and further because retroactivity would not have been a feature of a replicated contract. 3)Appellate courts are unanimous in instructing the reviewing courts to show deference to the expertise of the reviewing judge because of its experience in the field. However, if the reviewing court is to have any function at all it must be able to assess the decision by some standard. The test of'substantial compliance' would involve consideration of the purpose of the time limit and the probability of prejudice which might arise from failure to comply. 4)The decision to allow the graduated employees to receive their back pay was not, in light of the late decision, of a breach of Natural justice.","[1] This is a motion for judicial review of the decision of the Saskatchewan Labour Relations Board (""the Board"").

Given the need for the sentencing judge to address deterrence in a public welfare statute, the sentence was 'demonstrably unfit.' Oppositely, it was both appropriate and fit.  Opposite of the usual negative connotation of achieving compliance by threat of punishment, there was also a factor of factality to the sentence, namely, the fact that the offences were committed within the context of the common law.",0.45057471264367815
b_2004skqb156.txt,"The appellant appeals the calculation of his income replacement benefit made by the respondent, SGI, as provided by Part VIII of The Automobile Accident Insurance Act. Under s. 198 of the Act, a hearing was held to determine certain facts. The parties agree the appellant was a non-earner as defined by the Act, who was involved in a motor vehicle accident and suffered injuries to an extent that he is not able to carry on gainful employment as a skidder operator. The appellant estimated that he should receive an income replacement benefit (IRB) based on yearly wages in excess of $50,000. This position was based on employment promised to the appellant that would have started during the first 180 days following the accident. The respondent submits that the weighted average approach sets the IRB much lower, as in the previous 3 years the appellant earned no more than $12,000 per year.

Under s. 198 of the Act, a hearing was held to determine certain facts. The appellant was involved in a motor vehicle accident on July 25, 1998 and suffered injuries to an extent that he was not able to carry on gainful employment as skidder operator. Counsel for SGI submitted that the weighted average approach in calculating the respondent's gross yearly employment income sets the IRB much lower than that of the appellant's. HELD: The appellant is entitled to solicitor-client costs.  1)The respondent stands for just this proposition. But, in that case, the court was required to make a determination whether the claimant was deprived of an employment insurance benefit in the first 180 days. This position is based on employment promised to the appellant which would have commenced during the first 90 days. If the appellant was entitled to benefits other than what SGI has paid him, he is awarded interest on the value of those benefits not paid, from June 1, 2001 to date. SGI did not receive information from the appellant regarding promised employment until that date, where the income is annualized, indexed and adjusted pursuant to s28. Other evidence leads to conclusion that the appellant would not have actually been employed at $17 per hour for 60 hours per week for the entire 180 day period. 2)The appellant's earning reality was working for employment income no more than half the time. Working for CLC Logging Ltd. amounted to wage rate of $16 per hour averaging 34.25 hours. Over that six-week period, the non-earner never worked close to 60 hours. The average work week was 34. 25 hours. 3)SGI submits that SGI's evidence that his operation continues in inclement weather is not less than the time that Montgrand would have actually worked. 4)The relevant provisions of the Personal Injury Benefits Regulations, c. A-35, Reg are as follows: s. 19(1)An income replacement benefits for non- earners to be calculated pursuant to section 116 of the PIBR are to be determined based solely on the time the victim would have been employed during the 1,180 days.

6_2009nssc387.txt,"The divorcing parties disagreed about whether the wife's son from a previous relationship (now 13) was a 'child of the marriage.' While they lived together for seven years and had one child together, they were married for less than a year. The wife alleged the husband had stood in the place of a parent to the child. She claimed this was evidenced by the fact that: he started acting like a dad before the parties lived together (when the child was two); he was involved in things like medical appointments and school activities; the child's biological father only recently became involved; and they had discussed adoption early in the relationship. The evidence showed the decision to allow the child's biological father to assume an increasing role in his life was made solely by the wife. The child no longer had contact with the husband. The child is not a 'child of the marriage.' The husband did not stand in the place of a parent to him. He was a big part of the child's life but his role was mostly incidental to the relationship with the wife and a normal part of living with a child. The marriage was short and the father's parenting role was diminished before the marriage (by the mother's choice to allow the biological father back into the child's life, and the parties' failure to pursue the idea of adoption that was raised early on). Applying the Supreme Court's decision in Cook (2000), the threshold for finding parental status is high and reserved for cases where a person can clearly be shown to have assumed a parental role in substantial substitution for the biological parent. Such is not the case here.","The parties married in 2001 and separated less than one year later. They have a child, Ella, born April 3, 2004.

The respondent asserts that the child is “child of a marriage” and seeks child support for him from Delorey. HELD: 1)The threshold for parental status finding must be pegged at a sufficiently high point that it avoids the imposition of obligations and the acquisition of access and custody rights except where the step-parent can be clearly shown to have assumed the role of the natural parent and in substantial substitution for that natural parent's role.

HELD: The purpose of Queen's Bench Rule 139 is to provide the defendant with sufficient particulars to comprehend the nature and extent of the plaintiff's claim and respond with an intelligible statement of defence. Rule 164 allows a defendant to make a demand for particulars and disclosure of documents to assess the merits of the case, assess the merits of settlement and to prepare for examination for discovery. In this case, the defendants are entitled to know the current medical condition of the plaintiff prior to discovery because they might need further medical examinations, medical opinions and the assistance of an accident reconstructionist or mechanic to prepare to represent their client at the discovery. The plaintiff was granted 40 days from the date of the order to reply to the demand for particulars.","FIAT: The plaintiffs were operating a tractor unit bearing Manitoba licence plates and pulling a semi-trailer bearing an Alberta licence plate. On the 22nd day of August 2004, the plaintiffs were involved in a head on collision on a stretch of highway in the Province of Saskatchewan. The plaintiff sustained right leg injury, lacerations, back injury and post-traumatic stress disorder. The defendant auto insurers of each of the three provinces are named defendants. Saskatchewan, at all material times, was governed by a no-fault insurance regime. The plaintiffs claimed DDH had not recovered from her injuries and damages were accruing but the extent thereof was not yet known. The defendants, after delivery of the initial pleadings of the opponent, sought better particulars and disclosure of documents. HELD: The defendants' application was granted. Each of the defendants furnished a draft order. Each defendant's application was to issue as an order of the court, save and except for the request for costs in the cause. It would be premature to award costs. The trial judge will be able to see the reply to demands for particulars and be better positioned to assess the merits of these motions than I was able to infer from the material presently before the court.","[7] Each of the defendants, in groups of three in all, have now brought three notices of motion before the court in chambers in which they seek the court’s order that the plaintiffs “deliver a Statement of Particulars in full response to all particulars sought in the Demand for Particulars served upon the plaintiffs by these defendants”. The defendants each ask for a “further order compelling the plaintiffs to produce copies of all documents listed under the first schedule of their initial Statement as to Documents, as requested by Counsel for these defendants, pursuant to Rule 213 of the Rules of Court”. Unlike Rule 139, which has as its main purpose the provision of sufficient particulars to enable a defendant to comprehend the nature and extent of the plaintiffs’ claim and respond with an intelligible statement of defence, Rule 164 has a different, but similar, scope. Rule 164 enables a party, after delivery of the initial pleadings of the opponent, to demand better particulars and disclosure of documents. The defendants are entitled to this information, at a minimum, before discovery. The defendants may also need the assistance of an accident reconstructionist or mechanic to assist in the preparation of a meaningful examination for discovery.

Matrimonial property owned at the time of separation in 1995 had been divided except for a pension and RSP. The parties agreed to joint custody in 1996 in an interim separation agreement and the father would pay support of $693.80 per month.HELD: 1)The evidence demonstrated a breakdown of the marriage as established by s.8(2)(a) of the Divorce Act. 2)Joint custody was ordered such that the children would reside an equal amount of time in each home, alternating every two weeks. The most important consideration was stability which was to be found in the father's home. Only the best interests of the children must be taken into consideration as determined by the condition, means, needs and other circumstances of the children. 3)The child support payable by the father was reduced by 30 percent. The table amount for four children based on the father's income of $45,900 was $962 per month. The mother's income was below the level at which any support would be payable.

They both received a damage settlement from, and signed releases in favour of, the vehicle's owner and his insurance company ('Citadel'). More than five years later, they brought this action against the car's manufacturer (the defendant, GMCL), claiming the accident was caused by an inherent flaw in the vehicle's design and seeking further damages. GMCL moved for summary judgement on the pleadings in relation to Steven and Jody Johansson, on the basis of the releases. They indicated that, should this matter proceed to trial, they would be joining Citadel as a third party. Motion granted; Steven and Jody Johansson's claims dismissed. There are no genuine issues for trial; the only facts in dispute relate to Mary Johansson. The releases were clear and unambiguous. Although neither plaintiff had the benefit of independent legal advice when signing, they both accepted payment in full and final settlement of any damages arising from the accident. They should not now expect to recover further compensation, especially where pursuing the claim will result in a claim for contribution or indemnity against Citadel. While GMCL was not a party to the release, the release did contemplate third parties being covered insofar as those third parties 'might claim contribution or indemnity'. Both conditions from the SCC case of Fraser River [1999] have been met: the parties to the contract (Citadel and the plaintiffs) intended to extend the benefit in question to the third party seeking to rely on it; and the very activities concerned are those contemplated as coming within the scope of the contract in general. GMCL should be entitled to use the releases to defend the action brought by these plaintiffs. To allow the action to proceed would be an abuse of the court's process.","The plaintiffs were injured in a single vehicle accident while passengers in a vehicle driven by the other plaintiff. The accident occurred on October 25, 1998. Both the plaintiff and the driver were paid damages for the injuries they sustained. The amount paid to each of the plaintiffs was acknowledged in writing and they each signed a release acknowledging full and final settlement of any claims arising from the accident. The releases were given to Citadel General Assurance Company (Citadel), the owner of the motor vehicle involved in the accident and driver of the vehicle involved. The two plaintiffs were paid $25,000 for their injuries as well as a $5,000 settlement for the driver and $7,500 for their insurer. Both parties had agreed to the terms of the settlement and agreed to it voluntarily. They should not now expect to be compensated further, particularly where to pursue a claim for contribution or indemnity against Citadel. This is indeed what could result based on the defence filed on behalf of GMCL. HELD: Both “Fraser River” conditions were satisfied and GMCL should be entitled to use the Releases to defend against the two plaintiffs who have already been compensated for their injury by Citadel. To allow their action to proceed would be an abuse of this Court’s process.","[1] The defendant, General Motors of Canada Limited (henceforth “GMCL”), moves for an Order for Summary Judgment on Evidence to dismiss the claims made by two of the plaintiffs, Steven Johansson and Jody Johansson (formerly Jody Robichaud).

The plaintiffs now claim damages for the injuries they sustained as a result of the accident which they allege was caused by the careless and negligent actions of GMCL in the design and manufacture of the vehicle involved. In short there was no privity of contract and since the alleged manufacturing defect was not known at the time the releases were signed there could be no intention to include GMCL.

2009nsca44.txt,"The municipality appealed the trial court's decision to summarily strike their claim against the province, pursuant to R14.25 of the Civil Procedure Rules (1972). At trial, the municipality argued s. 36 of the Constitution Act compels the province to take appropriate steps to alleviate regional disparities. Arguing this is an enforceable obligation that was breached by the province, the municipality sought a declaration from the court to that effect. The municipality's arguments on appeal focused on the justiciability of s. 36. The province concentrated on the fact the judge had dismissed based on deficiencies in the pleadings, calling the municipality's claim too vague to succeed. Appeal dismissed. The effective standard of review is correctness - whether the judge erred in law by striking the claim. The appeal court carefully framed the issues, and examined s. 36 (its intent, and application). Rule 14.25 is a drastic remedy, and the trial judge was aware the province had a high threshold to meet in order to have the claim struck.

The court struck the claim as disclosing no reasonable cause of action. HELD: The respondent appealed the decision to strike the claim. The Court held that, without a challenge to legislation, the Municipality does not create a justiciable issue by referring in the claim to s.36 of the Constitution Act, when the commitments set out in that section do not alter the Legislature's right to exercise legislative authority. A general attack on “government” action, alleging that the Nova Scotia regime is constitutionally deficient, is too vague a basis for a court to determine under s.52 of the Act that law “is inconsistent with the provisions” and “of no force or effect.” The court also held that the respondent’s proposed interpretation of s. 36 of the Charter could not be struck summarily because it was not plain and obvious that the claim would fail.","Result: Appeal dismissed. 2.

e_2017skqb380.txt,"HELD: 1) The court ordered joint custody and continued primary residence with the wife and specified access to the husband. The child’s interests were best served by a parenting regime that preserved the stability the wife provided as his primary caregiver, while expanding the periods of uninterrupted time with his father. It was best that the parties interact minimally with each other. The mother was generally contemptuous of the husband’s role as parent and sometimes restricted or denied the child’s access with him. There was no credible evidence that the child was suicidal as the mother alleged, nor did any evidence support her allegations of physical or sexual abuse. Rather, evidence confirmed that the child was smart, sometimes sensitive, but generally happy. 2) The husband had professional corporation. His income was determined from his line 150 income, as adjusted to reflect the actual dividend income he received. His income should not be augmented by dividend income equal to his corporation’s net earnings. Only current pre-tax earnings are truly surplus to corporation’s needs, without exposing it to encroachment on its capital or undermining its viability. The relevance of the wife’s income was limited to the apportionment of s. expenses. It was not appropriate to impute income to her. She was intentionally underemployed, but her decision was justified initially by the needs of her son and more recently by her own reasonable educational needs and the obligation to become qualified to practice medicine in Canada. Retroactive child support was not appropriate, except in respect of the two-month period when the wife was overseas, the husband was caring for their child and he admittedly neglected to pay child support in accordance with court order. There was considerable evidence upon which to conclude that a retroactive award would place an undue hardship upon the husband as, pursuant to the terms of this judgment, he was obliged to assume significant family debt, provide a considerable equalization payment and pay increased child and spousal support. 3) The husband retained the family home and sole responsibility for the mortgage thereon. The court ordered him to pay one half of the equity in the home to the wife. Otherwise, the parties were to retain all other items of family property in their respective possession and be solely responsible for any indebtedness in their respective names. The Family Property Act does not mandate the apportionment of debt, equal or otherwise, save to the extent that fairness requires an unequal division of family property to reflect the parties’ respective obligations. The court’s discretion to equalize the parties’ debt by an uneven division did not extend to the family home. 4) The wife was entitled to compensatory and non-compensatory spousal support. The disparity in their incomes was directly attributable to her role in the marriage and their mutual efforts to advance his career. The wife’s income consisted almost entirely of spousal support. However, the high amount of debt assumed by the husband coupled with his limited means for satisfying this judgment, warranted a departure from the range of outcomes suggested by the Spousal Support Advisory Guidelines. Given the genuine and material uncertainty as to the wife’s future need and extent to which she will achieve self-sufficiency, an indefinite award reviewable on the earlier of a date approximately one year from the trial date or the wife becoming qualified to practice medicine was appropriate. The court declined to impute income to the wife or to order retroactive spousal support. 5) Judgment for divorce was granted, with judgment to take effect on the conclusion of the appeal period.","HELD: The Court found the petitioner's Federal Child Support Guidelines income to be slightly in excess of $245,000 and directed that he pay interim child support in the amount of $1,949.00 and interim spousal and child support of $5,250.00 per month. The Court granted the respondent interim primary residence of the child and directed the matter to pre-trial conference.","[266] In the absence of an agreement or court order to the contrary, the petitioner and the respondent are presumed to be joint custodians of their son, D.K. No such agreement exists in this case, and my interim order of August 7, 2014, while providing for interim parenting, did nothing to displace that presumption. [300] The evidence confirms that D.K. is a smart, sometimes sensitive but generally happy child. [304] In assessing the veracity of her claims, I note the respondent acknowledged, under cross-examination, that she had also previously accused the petitioner of threatening her and of sexually assaulting D.K., although she never made a formal complaint. [309] While I accept that the respondent has been D.K.’s primary and psychological parent throughout his life, I am equally satisfied on the evidence that she is generally contemptuous of the petitioner’s role as a parent and she has, except when it has suited her needs, restricted or in some instances, completely denied D.K.’s right to enjoy reasonable access with the petitioner. [310] In the circumstances, I am satisfied that D.K.’s interests will be best served by a parenting regime that preserves the stability the respondent has traditionally provided as his primary caregiver, while expanding the periods of uninterrupted time he enjoys with the petitioner. [343] Finally, there is considerable evidence upon which to conclude that a retroactive award would work an undue hardship upon the petitioner. Pursuant to the terms of this judgment, he will be obliged to assume significant family debt, to provide the respondent with a considerable equalization payment in respect of her interest in the family home, and to pay increased child and spousal support. [344] Applying the D.B.S. factors holistically to the circumstances of this case, I am not satisfied that it is an appropriate instance in which to make a retroactive order, save and except for the two months period in which the petitioner admittedly refused or neglected to pay child support in accordance with the interim order of this Court. As such, the petitioner shall pay to the respondent, on account of retroactive child support, the sum of $3,898.00. As there was no evidence that these proceeds, or any portion thereof continued to exist or are otherwise traceable as of the date of application, they do not meet the definition of family property. The respondent is entitled to an equalization payment from the petitioner in the amount of $36,850.00, representing one half of the parties’ total equity therein of $73,700.00. [373] On the evidence before me, I have no hesitation in concluding that the respondent has established she is entitled to support on both a compensatory and non-compensatory basis. However, the unusually high amount of debt assumed by the petitioner, coupled with his limited means of satisfying such an award warrant a departure from the range of outcomes suggested by the SSAG. [393] There is at present in this case, a genuine and material uncertainty as to the respondent’s future need and the extent to which she will achieve some degree of self-sufficiency. In the circumstances, I conclude that it is appropriate to make an indefinite award, which will be reviewable on the earlier of December 1, 2018, or the respondent becoming qualified to practice medicine. In all the circumstances, I decline to make any order with regard to retroactive spousal support. CONCLUSION [399] The parties shall continue to enjoy joint custody of their son D.K., born --------------------. The petitioner’s obligations in respect of retroactive child support are fixed at $3,898.00.

The petitioner had been residing in Regina for the past few years and claimed that shared parenting and an equal division of family home and property had been his primary motivation for moving to Canada. The respondent, he maintained, wanted him to remain in Canada but felt that, since he was self-employed, he was not able to afford it. As for the parties’ debts, the petitioner claimed that he had obtained an interest-free loan from the respondent that was used primarily to pay child care, education and travel expenses. He also claimed that the respondent was a better parent because she had taken more time off work and had been able to spend more time with him. The court found the respondent to have an income of approximately $309,700.00, which was approximately double the amount he earned in the previous two years, and attributed the increase in income to increased access by the respondent. The Court also found that there were other outstanding debts owing to the health region in Ontario, which the petitioner had not been aware of prior to the commencement of his residency in Canada. These debts were the subject of an answer and counter petition filed by the petitioner against the respondent in January 2015 against them both on the basis that they had unilaterally transferred their son to the province. HELD: 1) The respondent was granted access on the first three weekends of each month, as well as every Wednesday.  2) The Court ordered the respondent paid interim child tax benefits of $3,000 per month for the first two years. 3) The petitioner was awarded access on alternate weekends. 4) The court prohibited the respondent from removing the petitioner from the province for any length of time. 5) On a balance of probabilities, the respondent would not be able to support himself on an ongoing basis due to the nature of his practice. On balance, the court found that it would be difficult for the petitioner to continue living in the province if he was permitted to travel to visit his son in the U.S. Further, the Court found that if the respondent had continued to work and did not wish to return to the country, he would be entitled to a portion of the monies from the Ontario monies for the RQHR loan","[266] In the absence of an agreement or court order to the contrary, the petitioner and the respondent are presumed to be joint custodians of their son, D.K.

In the circumstances, I conclude that it is appropriate to make an indefinite award, which will be reviewable on the earlier of December 1, 2018, or the respondent becoming qualified to practice medicine. In all the circumstances, I decline to make any order with regard to retroactive spousal support. CONCLUSION [399] The parties shall continue to enjoy joint custody of their son D.K., born --------------------. The petitioner’s obligations in respect of retroactive child support are fixed at $3,898.00. [414] Commencing December 1, 2015 and on the first day of each and every month thereafter, the petitioner shall pay support for the respondent in the amount of $6,000.00, provided however that the said order shall be reviewable at the instance of either party upon the earlier of the respondent becoming qualified to practice medicine in Canada, or the 1st day of December 2018. Within 14 days thereafter, the petitioner shall pay to the respondent the sum of $36,850.00, representing her interest in the equity therein.",0.12784588441331,"HELD: The Court found the petitioner’s Federal Child Support Guidelines to be slightly in excess of $245,000 and directed that he pay interim child support for D.K. in the amount of $1,949.00 and interim spousal and child support of $5,250.00 per month. The petitioner had been residing in Regina for the past few years and claimed that shared parenting and an equal division of family home and property had been his primary motivation for moving to Canada. The respondent, he maintained, wanted him to remain in Canada but felt that, since he was self-employed, he was not able to afford it. As for the parties’ debts, the petitioner claimed that he had obtained an interest-free loan from the respondent that was used primarily to pay child care, education and travel expenses. He also claimed that the respondent was a better parent because she had taken more time off work and had been able to spend more time with him. The court found the respondent to have an income of approximately $309,700.00, which was approximately double the amount he earned in the previous two years, and attributed the increase in income to increased access by the respondent. The Court also found that there were other outstanding debts owing to the health region in Ontario, which the petitioner had not been aware of prior to the commencement of his residency in Canada. These debts were the subject of an answer and counter petition filed by the petitioner against the respondent in January 2015 against them both on the basis that they had unilaterally transferred their son to the province. HELD: 1) The respondent was granted access on the first three weekends of each month, as well as every Wednesday.  2) The Court ordered the respondent paid interim child tax benefits of $3,000 per month for the first two years. 3) The petitioner was awarded access on alternate weekends. 4) The court prohibited the respondent from removing the petitioner from the province for any length of time. 5) On a balance of probabilities, the respondent would not be able to support himself on an ongoing basis due to the nature of his practice. On balance, the court found that it would be difficult for the petitioner to continue living in the province if he was permitted to travel to visit his son in the U.S. Further, the Court found that if the respondent had continued to work and did not wish to return to the country, he would be entitled to a portion of the monies from the Ontario monies for the RQHR loan",0.09714285714285714

This it did not do, and I accordingly find, that Clause 40 was a condition precedent to the Display Rental Agreement and since the approval was not forthcoming, the contract was null and void and the defendants are not liable for any breach thereof. I have come to the conclusion that the plaintiff is entitled to be compensated for unjust enrichment from the corporate defendant only, Nova Enterprises Limited.

7_2005skca97.txt,"This case concerns the fixture financing provisions of The Personal Property Security Act, 1993 (PPSA). The respondent claims damages from the appellant Credit Union. The claim arises from the Credit Union's delay in removing a Quonset in which the Credit Union held a security interest. The trial judge found in favour of the respondent and awarded damages on the basis that the Credit Union became a tenant at sufferance of the respondent when it failed to remove the Quonset and therefore was obliged to pay rent. The issue is whether the PPSA precludes a claim by a land owner against a financer arising from the financer's failure to remove a fixture within a commercially reasonable time after giving notice of its intentions in that regard. HELD: Appeal allowed. Cross appeal dismissed. In light of the causes of action pled and the evidence brought forward, the respondent's claim against the Credit Union cannot succeed.  1) Section 36 of the PPSA may speak exhaustively to the relative priorities of financers and land owners in fixtures. It does not necessarily speak in that way to the full range of rights and claims that those parties might have against each other. There is no principled basis on which a person with an interest in land should be denied meaningful relief when a financer, without excuse, acts in a commercially unreasonable manner by failing or refusing to remove a fixture after giving formal notice of its intention to do so. 2) It would have been improper for the respondent to deny permission to remove the building unless the Credit Union paid an amount in respect of the property taxes attributable to it. Allowing a person with an interest in land to oblige financers to pay property taxes before realizing on their security would amount to a substantial realignment of the careful balance between the rights of fixture financers and holders of property interest reflected in s. 36 of the PPSA. 3) The Credit Union could not have been either a tenant at sufferance or a tenant at will of the respondent for the fundamental reason that there was no landlord and tenant relationship between them. The respondent's claims in this regard fail. 4) The respondent has failed to present evidence that would allow this Court to quantify the benefit conferred on the Credit Union and to provide appropriate relief. As a consequence, no effect can be given to the unjust enrichment argument. 5) In light of the conclusion that there was no tenancy at sufferance or tenancy at will, the cross-appeal fails.","This case concerns the fixture financing provisions of The Personal Property Security Act, 1993. The respondent Gari Holdings Ltd. claims damages from the appellant Langham Credit Union Ltd. The claim arises from the claim arising from the Credit Union's delay in removing from Gari's land a quonset in which the financer held a security interest. The trial judge found in favour of Gari and awarded damages on the basis that it became a tenant at sufferance and was obliged to pay rent. HELD: The appeal was allowed. 1)The PPSA does not operate to preclude the claims advanced by Gari in this case. It is consistent with the regime established pursuant to it. Section 36 provides only that a person with an interest in land may refuse permission to remove goods until he or she has received adequate security for reimbursement of damages caused by their removal. The plaintiff has established that while the building was a fixture on the property prior to it being constructed, it had changed its position as of September 1, 1999. That payment was made in order to avoid tax enforcement proceedings by the Town of Prince Albert Land Titles Office. 2)The trial judge's award effectively disregards the priority provisions of s. 36 and substitutes a new remedy for the rights expressly set out in ss. 36(9) to (16). The Credit Union took the position that it would have been improper for Gari to deny permission to allow the removal of the building unless the credit Union paid an amount in respect of the property taxes. 3)Gari's claims in this regard must fail.","Disposition: Appeal allowed Cross-Appeal dismissed [1] This case concerns the fixture financing provisions of The Personal Property Security Act, 1993, S.S. 1993, c.

The observations of the arresting officer upon which the officer formed reasonable, probable and objective grounds (e.g. that he had just swished with mouthwash because he could smell mints in the air) were sufficient to establish that his blood alcohol content was in excess of.08. The breath samples were received directly into the vehicle or into an approved container or an approved instrument operated by qualified technician and showed the accused the lowest of the concentrations of alcohol on his breath.  4) Although the accused was prone to slurred speech and confusion, the officer was of the opinion that his ability to operate a motor vehicle was impaired by alcohol as shown by the reflective material on the side of the marked police cruiser. The reflective material could have been used to mask the odour of alcohol. 5) The Court cannot attribute the accused’s driving actions to anything other than being in a state of underemployment.

The observations of the arresting officer upon which the officer formed reasonable, probable and objective grounds (e.g. that he had just swished with mouthwash because he could smell mints in the air) were sufficient to establish that his blood alcohol content was in excess of.08. The breath samples were received directly into the vehicle or into an approved container or an approved instrument operated by qualified technician and showed the accused the lowest of the concentrations of alcohol on his breath.  4) Although the accused was prone to slurred speech and confusion, the officer was of the opinion that his ability to operate a motor vehicle was impaired by alcohol as shown by the reflective material on the side of the marked police cruiser. The reflective material could have been used to mask the odour of alcohol. 5) The Court cannot attribute the accused’s driving actions to anything other than being in a state of underemployment. The accused had not been drinking and was doing well in the field. 6) The U-turn, while illegal, was explained as part of the act of returning to Gerald in order to re-orient himself.","[1] The Crown appeals from the acquittal of the Respondent, Norbert F. Knoedler (“Mr. Knoedler”) on June 4, 2009, in Provincial Court on a charge that on or about October 27, 2007, at Esterhazy District , in the Province of Saskatchewan, having consumed alcohol in such quantity that the concentration thereof in his blood exceeded eighty milligrams of alcohol in one hundred millilitres of blood, he did operate a motor vehicle, contrary to s. 253(b) and s. 255(1) of the Criminal Code and on a charge that on the same date and at the same place, while his ability to operate a motor vehicle was impaired by alcohol, he did operate a motor vehicle, contrary to s. 253(a) and s. 255 of the Criminal Code. In the circumstances, the appeal against the acquittal on the charge of impaired driving is dismissed and this appeal will proceed on the basis that the Crown seeks to overturn the acquittal on the charge of driving while over .08. In my respectful opinion, the learned trial judge failed to consider the totality of the circumstances in determining whether Cst. Lockyer had reasonable and probable grounds to make the breath demand. [30] With respect, I am of the view that the learned trial judge erred in finding that Cst. Lockyer’s subjective belief of impairment was not supported on the facts. The Certificate of Analyses filed as Exhibit P-1 at the trial will be admitted as a full exhibit and will become part of the Crown’s case. In this case, I find that the Crown has proved each and every element of the charge of driving while over .08 beyond a reasonable doubt. Therefore, evidence of the results of the analyses so made is, pursuant to s. 258(1)(c) of the Criminal Code, conclusive proof that the concentration of alcohol in Mr. Knoedler’s blood both at the time when the analyses were made and at the time when the offence was alleged to have been committed was the lowest of the concentrations determined by the analyses, which was 100 milligrams in 100 millilitres of blood. [37] In the circumstances, I allow the Crown’s appeal, set aside the verdict of acquittal on the charge of operating a motor vehicle while over .08 and enter a verdict of guilty with respect to the offence of operating a motor vehicle while over .08 under s. 253(b) and 255(1) of the Criminal Code, being Count No. 1 on Information No. 24312600.",0.2442002442002442,"The Crown appeals from the acquittal of the respondent on a charge of impaired driving. The Crown claims the learned trial judge erred in law in excluding two breath samples taken after the arrest of the accused on the basis that they were obtained in violation of s. 8 of the Charter. HELD: The appeal is dismissed. 1) While the trial judge was aware that an analysis of the reasonable and probable grounds (i.e. that the accused had consumed alcohol in such a quantity that the concentration in his blood exceeded 80 milligrams of alcohol in 100 millilitres of blood) was not sufficient to set aside the conviction on the impaired driving charge. 2) The officer was entitled to consider the circumstance as whole and need not prove prima facie case. The Court must consider the subjective and objective factors, such as whether the accused's driving actions were reasonable at the time of the demand, the manner in which he was asked to act and the fact that he was attempting to obtain a breath sample constituted objective evidence of impairment. 3) The accused was subject to unreasonable search and seizure pursuant to s. 253(b) and s. 255 of the Criminal Code.

The driver suffered soft tissue injuries to her neck and mid and lower back, blunt trauma to both knees and bruising of the right hand. She underwent physiotherapy for three months and made a complete recovery within two years except for flare-ups in the upper back. The second plaintiff suffered neck stiffness, bilateral shoulder pain and bruising to his arm and leg.

9_1998canlii13836.txt,"The accused who had plead guilty to a charge of dangerous driving causing death sought a conditional sentence to be served in the community. Various witnesses gave conflicting accounts of the driving leading up to the accident and the accident itself. Two vehicles driving at a high rate of speed, one in the left lane and one in the right hand curb lane passed vehicles stopped at a cross walk, the later striking and killing a pedestrian. The vehicles had been observed pulling around other vehicles whenever possible and 'jousting' with each other. HELD: A sentence of 90 days to be served intermittently in a provincial correctional centre was imposed. Conditions of probation included restraint from the consumption of alcohol and non-prescription drugs for 24 hours prior to attendance at the centre. An 18 month probation order required him to perform 200 hours of community service and to enroll in a defensive driving course. He was prohibited from operating a motor vehicle for three years and was to pay a surcharge of $250.  1)The Saskatchewan Court of Appeal had not to date considered the question of whether it was appropriate that a sentence of imprisonment be served in the community where the offence is that of dangerous driving causing death. It has consistently endorsed sentences of incarceration for the offence of impaired driving causing death. Alternatives to incarceration were rejected as not adequately reflecting the gravity of the offence and as not serving to deter either the offender or the general public from committing like offences. 2)The driver's lack of attention together with excessive speed caused the accident. Alcohol was not involved. He stopped to render assistance whereas the driver of the second car which had been racing with him left the scene of the accident immediately.

The accused had six speeding convictions. He had a minor youth record involving mischief.","The accused was 19 years of age at the time of the accident and had just passed a pedestrian crossing the street. He was driving a light colored Audi that passed him at a high rate of speed. The pedestrian was thrown from the vehicle. The accused was charged with dangerous driving causing death. HELD: The Court of Appeal held that a sentence in the low end of the range is one which should be imposed and that such a sentence should be served inthe community rather than in a corrections facility.  1)The accused had consumed significant quantity of alcohol and was in no shape to drive vehicle. His actions were clearly inappropriate and imprudent and his failure to monitor and perceive the situation in front of him resulted in tragic consequences. For whatever reason, he failed to exercise his right to be free from alcohol and drugs and drove at speed in excess of 60 km/hr.  2)The court found that incarceration should be limited to 18 months and that under the circumstances of this offence a conditional sentence would not be appropriate.","The accused, Chad J.

Regina, in the Province of Saskatchewan did operate a
motor vehicle on the streets of the City of Regina to
wit: 200 North Albert Street, in a manner dangerous to
the public, and did hereby cause the death of Vernon
Keith Ward contrary to Section 249(4) of the Criminal
Code of Canada. Specifically the defence argues that a sentence in the lower
end of the range is one which should be imposed and that such
a sentence should be a conditional sentence to be served in
the community, rather than in a corrections facility. I am concerned in this matter with the principles of
general deterrence, denunciation, protection of the public,

specific deterrence and rehabilitation of the accused. A troubling factor in this instance arises from the
subsequent convictions of the accused for two speeding
offences. Therefore, in respect to the offence of dangerous
driving causing death, I sentence the accused to be imprisoned
for 90 days in the Provincial Correctional Centre at Regina,

probation order which shall commence after he has served his
sentence of imprisonment for 90 days and which shall be for a

Kramer Ltd., 2008 SKQB 27. Upon considering the factors in Chaban, it must be concluded that the defendants' application has merit. There is clear severability between the threshold issue of liability and the consequential issue of damages in the plaintiffs' action. The entitlement to sue for disgorgement of profits hinges on whether the defendant, as the plaintiff's former employee, was in a position of a fiduciary.

The issues in this litigation are such that delay in full disclosure of material pertaining to damages makes little difference. Both parties know the profitability of the SR&ED consulting business. The risks that must be weighed in considering settlement pertain to liability. Those risks have not changed by granting the defendants their application. 3)In Saskatchewan, authority to sever the issues at trial is founded on the Court of Queen”s Bench inherent jurisdiction.

The encryption on the red computer was so formidable that the best forensic technicians from the RCMP were not able to get past it. The court found that it would be unlikely for the accused not to detect a hacker given the encryption and his monitoring of bandwidth usage.

HELD: Appeal dismissed. 1)The forensic accountant's evidence was properly admitted as explanatory of the calculations done.

Also at issue was whether a forensic accountant should have been permitted to testify as to the present value of the Plaintiff's future earning capacity. HELD: Appeal dismissed. 1)The forensic accountant's evidence was properly admitted as explanatory of the calculations done. The same calculations could have been done by a computer program or by counsel or the trial judge with the assistance of the tables to the Rules of Court. 2)The trial judge properly explained to the jury that the accountant was not testifying as an expert. 3)Given the nature of the accountant's evidence, no expert fees should be permitted to the Plaintiff for the accountant's report or attendance. 4)The Appellant's argument that the trial judge failed to properly direct the jury as to the weight to be given to the accountant's evidence was rejected. 5)The Court was unable to say that the jury's award for loss of future income was so inordinately high that it should be set aside and a new trial ordered. 6)The Plaintiff's cross-appeal relating to the disability benefits was also dismissed.","Following a jury trial of this action for damages for personal injuries and loss sustained in an automobile collision, a verdict was pronounced awarding damages of $409,251.18 to the respondent. The appellant contended that the trial judge erred in law in failing to caution the jury regarding the weight to be given to the testimony of Douglas Kalesnikoff as expert opinion evidence. HELD: 1)The jury was instructed to consider the present value of the respondent's earnings and future loss of earnings. 2)The respondent was to receive salary or wages at periodic intervals until retirement, lay-off, or death. 3)The award for loss of income was reduced to $5,553.18 with pre-trial stipulation. 4)No substantial wrong or miscarriage of justice was demonstrated but in the circumstances of this case the Court was limited to dismissing the appeal or ordering a new trial. 5)The appellant's claim was dismissed. 6)The appropriate lump sum was not available at the conclusion of litigation. 7)The trial judge properly instructed the respondent on the limited purpose for which she could have been expected to work and the use of a computer program to assist her in calculating future income.","The defendant Margaret Bennett appeals from a judgment for damages pronounced in Queen\'s Bench. Following a jury trial of this action for damages for personal injuries and loss sustained in an automobile collision, judgment was pronounced on 13 May 1994 awarding damages of $409,251.18 to the respondent plaintiff. In her cross-appeal the respondent challenges the trial judge\'s instruction to deduct sick leave benefits which were used in consequence of her injuries from the past loss of earnings component. Accordingly the admission of this evidence did not impermissibly invade the province of the jury in this damage assessment. Although the trial judge did not specifically focus on the need to weigh and consider the assumptions underlying Mr. Kalesnikoff's calculations, we find no reversible error in the circumstances of this case. [36] In our opinion the learned trial judge was entitled to reject the pure mathematical approach propounded by the plaintiff. Applying the controlling standard of review, we cannot say that the award in issue was so inordinately high that it must be set aside and a new trial ordered. Beck, J., sitting without jury, assessed the damages (a mortgagee's negligence case) at $2,800. Accordingly we reject this ground of appeal and dismiss the within appeal with costs on double column V. In light of Mr. Halyk\'s submission we dismiss the cross-appeal without costs.",0.22528735632183908,"Following a jury trial of this action for damages for personal injuries and loss sustained in an automobile collision, a verdict was pronounced awarding damages of $409,251.18 to the respondent.

Application allowed in part; portions of arbitrator's decision where he accepted estimates of costs of repairs and loss of rental opportunity, awarded damages and applied the equitable principle of estoppel quashed; application dismissed with respect to the rest of arbitrator's decision. The arbitration clause was a limited arbitration clause and the arbitrator did not have jurisdiction to award damages or apply the equitable principle of estoppel. Although greater deference is shown to decisions of consensual arbitrators than to those of statutory arbitrators, consensual arbitrators are not immune from judicial review if the means of reaching the result were unreasonable. The results reached within the arbitrator's jurisdiction were not patently unreasonable.","The lease between the Landlord and Tenant contained an arbitration clause. The Tenant sought to have the award of the arbitrator made pursuant to that clause quashed. HELD: 1)The arbitrator was not required to interpret the words of the lease but could deal with the issues of responsibility for repairs, whether the loss was covered by insurance and whether insurance should cover the damage. 2)The arbitration clause in the lease was a limited arbitration clause which did not provide that all disputes between the parties are to be settled by arbitration but only disputes involving the clauses or provisions of a lease. 3)There was no evidence that the principles of waiver and estoppel applied as against the Tenant in these circumstances. The arbitrator's decision was not patently unreasonable but the interpretation of the relevant provisions of the collective agreement by the learned arbitrator is not.","The Tenant seeks to have the award of the arbitrator made pursuant to that clause quashed. I conclude that the arbitration clause under the lease is a limited arbitration clause.

In doing so, he exceeded his jurisdiction under the arbitration clause of the lease. [33] Accordingly, the decisions of the arbitrator dealing with damages and estoppel are set aside. He acted within his jurisdiction and his interpretation of the Collective Agreement is reasonable. In doing so, he did not make a patently unreasonable finding.

The Tenant sought to have the award of the arbitrator made pursuant to that clause quashed. The issues were: 1) Did the loss occur as a result of the acts or omissions of the Tenants or its servants and agents; was the loss covered by insurance and whether notification or claim was required; if so, was estoppel and whether insurance should have covered the damages. 2) Was the arbitration clause a limited arbitration clause? Had it been a case, in the face of a strong privative clause, that it was immune from judicial review, even if patently unreasonable? 3) If so, what was the extent of the damages? Estoppel should not be limited to the wording of the clauses of the lease. Where there is an error going to jurisdiction, judicial review is the proper remedy. The more specialized the tribunal the less inclined the courts should be to be to interfere with its awards. Here the courts in both directions agree that the standard of review is correctness with respect to the issue of jurisdiction. The arbitrator was not limited to interpreting the words in the lease but could deal more broadly with the clauses and their contents. The disputes were the result of acts or errors of the tenants and the landlords. There was no evidence that the tenants were contributing to the damage or that the damages were due to the actions of the landlords or the tenants themselves. To determine the scope of review, the court must look carefully at the decision.HELD: The decision of the majority in Lester was held to be a clear case of exceeding his jurisdiction. It does not appear that the expanded scope of judicial review reached its conclusion in either Lester or Paccar. The decision in Corn Growers establishes a need for particularly restricted scope for judicial review in the case of consensual arbitrations.","The Tenant seeks to have the award of the arbitrator made pursuant to that clause quashed. I conclude that the arbitration clause under the lease is a limited arbitration clause. [29] I also conclude for the same reason that the arbitrator was incorrect in assuming jurisdiction to apply the principle of estoppel against the Tenants. In doing so, he exceeded his jurisdiction under the arbitration clause of the lease. [33] Accordingly, the decisions of the arbitrator dealing with damages and estoppel are set aside. He acted within his jurisdiction and his interpretation of the Collective Agreement is reasonable. In doing so, he did not make a patently unreasonable finding. CONCLUSION [111] In summary, I conclude that those portions of the arbitrator’s decision where he accepted estimates of costs of repairs and loss of rental opportunity and awarded damages and where he applied the equitable principle of estoppel are to be quashed. The application is dismissed with respect to the rest of the arbitrator’s decision.",0.1710794297352342,"A dispute arose between a landlord and a tenant about damage to the premises and whose responsibility it was to repair the damage. The dispute was referred to arbitration as per the terms of the lease. The arbitrator found the tenant liable for the damage and ordered the tenant to pay the landlord specified amounts for repairs and loss of rental opportunity. The tenant made an application for judicial review of the arbitrator's decision. Application allowed in part; portions of arbitrator's decision where he accepted estimates of costs of repairs and loss of rental opportunity, awarded damages and applied the equitable principle of estoppel quashed; application dismissed with respect to the rest of arbitrator's decision. The arbitration clause was a limited arbitration clause and the arbitrator did not have jurisdiction to award damages or apply the equitable principle of estoppel. Although greater deference is shown to decisions of consensual arbitrators than to those of statutory arbitrators, consensual arbitrators are not immune from judicial review if the means of reaching the result were unreasonable. The results reached within the arbitrator's jurisdiction were not patently unreasonable.","The lease between the Landlord and the Tenant contained an arbitration clause. The Tenant sought to have the award of the arbitrator made pursuant to that clause quashed. The issues were: 1) Did the loss occur as a result of the acts or omissions of the Tenants or its servants and agents; was the loss covered by insurance and whether notification or claim was required; if so, was estoppel and whether insurance should have covered the damages. 2) Was the arbitration clause a limited arbitration clause? Had it been a case, in the face of a strong privative clause, that it was immune from judicial review, even if patently unreasonable? 3) If so, what was the extent of the damages? Estoppel should not be limited to the wording of the clauses of the lease. Where there is an error going to jurisdiction, judicial review is the proper remedy. The more specialized the tribunal the less inclined the courts should be to be to interfere with its awards. Here the courts in both directions agree that the standard of review is correctness with respect to the issue of jurisdiction. The arbitrator was not limited to interpreting the words in the lease but could deal more broadly with the clauses and their contents. The disputes were the result of acts or errors of the tenants and the landlords. There was no evidence that the tenants were contributing to the damage or that the damages were due to the actions of the landlords or the tenants themselves.

He argued that the investigating officer did not have reasonable and probable grounds to make a breath demand pursuant to s. 254(3) of the Criminal Code resulting in the arbitrary detention of the accused. The accused argued the Certificate of Analysis should be excluded. The officer responded to complaint of possible impaired driver weaving on the roadway and onto the sidewalk. The officer located vehicle with the same licence plate number. He observed the vehicle weaving from right to left in its lane. The vehicle braked suddenly and made right turn from the left lane. The officer activated his emergency equipment. The vehicle pulled over quickly but lurched forward and stopped abruptly as the officer walked towards the vehicle. The accused had glossy eyes, slurred speech, poor muscular control, difficulty extracting his licence and displayed poor balance when walking to the police vehicle. The officer did not note smell of alcohol. HELD: In this case, there was no dispute that the officer's belief in reasonable and probable grounds was honestly held and subjectively valid. While the officer could have asked the accused if he had been drinking alcohol, the weight to be given to any response from the officer was subjective Ã» he was not required to accept what he was told. Although it is possible to speculate that the symptoms of impairment in this case were caused by some medical condition, there is no evidence of any other possible explanation for the egregious driving and physical condition of the accused. In the absence of any evidence suggesting an alternative explanation, it is reasonable to conclude that the most obvious case was impairment by alcohol. The driving pattern and physical symptoms of the accused paint a stereotypical portrait of a motorist impaired by alcohol. The absence of a smell of alcohol or any admission of consumption does not vitiate the probative value of the other indicia when considered in their totality. In the face of the manner of driving and very significant symptoms of impairment, it would be ludicrous to suggest that the officer could only have had a reasonable suspicion that the accused had alcohol in his body.

The accused asserts that he was arbitrarily detained as the officer did not have reasonable grounds to make a demand for a sample of his breath for analysis. HELD: The Court held that there was no breach of s.8 or s.9 of the Charter and the Certificate of Analysis was therefore admissible. The only issue to resolve was whether the officer reasonably could have only a mere suspicion that the accused had alcohol in his body.

The adjudicator applied the appropriate principles of law to the facts as he found them. 4)The adjudicator acted within his jurisdiction when determining the terms of the employment contract and that the employer had not fulfilled his obligations.","The appellant sought an order quashing the adjudicator's decision following a hearing pursuant to s. 62.1 and 62.2 of The Labour Standards Act. The grounds relied on by the appellant gave rise to the following issues: (1) Did the adjud adjudicator err in law by finding that the respondent's conduct had not frustrated or materially breached her employment contract? (2) Whether the judge exceeded his jurisdiction by holding that Cajon, as the appellant's employer, had an obligation to attempt to resolve a situation of work difficulties that prevented her from reporting to work? (3) The adjudicator applied the appropriate principles of law to the facts, as hefound them. In addition, his findings of fact cannot be said to be 'patently unreasonable' because there was some evidence before him on which he could arrive at his conclusions. HELD: The appeal was dismissed with costs.  1)Cajon's president did not examine his company's lease (which was not produced at the hearing) in order to determine whether the rights of access and egress were guaranteed to the Respondent and its employees (which seems likely) and under which circumstances, if any, these rights could be suspended or terminated. Rather, Mr. Johns simply contacted the franchisor and was told that his employees should have followed the rules imposed upon Zellers employees. This does not seem reasonable on the part of the president in the circumstances. It has seven-year employee who presumably had performed her work satisfactorily and the only efforts by the employer were to ask Zellerers whether it was acting reasonably and to make the inquiry (just described) of the franchiseisor. An employer surely must be expected to make further inquiries and to engage in further efforts to ensure that it can comply with its obligations under the employment contract (i.e. to permit its employees access to the workplace) before it can claim that it is incapable of performing its contractual obligations. 2)The adjudicator acted within his jurisdiction when determining what the terms of Ms. Kovach's employment contract were and that the terms had not been frustrated by her conduct. 3)The appellant acted within its jurisdiction when deciding what terms of employment were and whether the terms should have been subject to proper notice.","[1] The appellant (""Cajon"") seeks an order quashing the

2002skqb68.txt,"An appeal from a summary conviction for unlawfully using a searchlight for the purpose of hunting. The trial judge made three distinct and alternate findings: based on the evidence presented, night hunting with an artificial light is so inherently dangerous as not to attract protection as an aboriginal right; based on the Sparrow test for prima facie infringement and justification, s.11.1(3) of the Regulations withstands both prima facie infringement and justifiability scrutiny; based on the authorities, s.11.1(3) of the Regulations does not touch the appellant's core as Indians and, therefore, does not give rise to interjurisdictional immunity. The trial judge found that aboriginal hunting rights must be exercised subject to any legislation that expresses legitimate safety concerns. The facts were not in dispute. The appellants, who were of Metis heritage and engaged in the traditional Metis way of life, argued they enjoy hunting rights within the meaning of s.12 of the Natural Resources Transfer Act and are exempt from any hunting prohibition when hunting on unoccupied Crown land. The respondent acknowledged that if they are Metis, they enjoy an aboriginal right to hunt for food as protected by s.35(1) of the Constitution Act, 1982. However, they are subject to the regulation prohibiting night hunting with artificial lights (except when hunting on a Reserve) because its primary objective is safety. At issue was whether the appellants, as Metis, are subject to s.11.1(3)of the Saskatchewan Regulations passed pursuant to the Wildlife Act. HELD: The appeal was dismissed. 1)The appellants failed to come within s.686(1)(a)(i) or (ii) of the Criminal Code. 2)The findings were supported by the evidence and were reasonable. There was no wrong decision on a question of law.  3)Aboriginal and Treaty rights are not absolute. Reasonable regulations aimed at ensuring safety do not infringe these rights. Laws having a safety objective do not infringe aboriginal rights. As safety legislation, s.13.1(3) has a conservation component. The Province has jurisdiction to pass conservation laws. Legislation prohibiting night hunting with artificial lights has been considered by the courts of several provinces. All courts found the practice dangerous and upheld the limiting provincial legislation. 4)The Court preferred the approach taken in R. v. Bernard, which is to consider safety as a factor in determining prima facie infringement and if necessary, justification pursuant to the Sparrow test. The issue in this case is whether the limiting legislation is a prima facie infringement on the appellants' right to hunt for food and if so, whether it is justifiable. Since Sparrow, it has become unnecessary and perhaps inappropriate to attempt to define aboriginal hunting rights. Sparrow presented three questions when deciding whether there has been a prima facie infringement of hunting rights: is the limitation reasonable; does the regulation cause undue hardship; does it deny their preferred means of exercising that right. In Seward and Bernard, the Sparrow test of infringement and justification was the only test applied. No infringement was found in either case. 5)The trial judge concluded the practice of night hunting by means of artificial light is highly dangerous. The prohibition was found not only to be reasonable but essential. The regulation presented no undue hardship and was never the preferred means of hunting by people of Sapwagamik. The legislation could not be considered a diminution of any assumed aboriginal right and there was thus no prima facie infringement of hunting rights by s.11.1(3).  6)It was not accepted that because Reserves are exempted, safety was not the primary purpose. Reserves were exempt out of respect for Band Council's right to pass their own safety laws pursuant to the Indian Act. 7)The trial judge correctly identified the test for justification of a legitimate regulation as being whether the legislation has a valid objective; whether the honour of the Crown is at stake; has there been as little infringement as possible; has the aboriginal group been consulted. 8)Section 11.1(3) restricts the method of hunting at night and to that extent it likely is a conservation infringement. If so, it is still permissible provincial legislation. It meets the Sparrow justification test because of the strong safety component. 9)Provincial hunting laws regulate aboriginal hunting rights; they do not extinguish them. Accordingly, such laws do not cross the interjurisdictional immunity boundary. They do not touch the core of Indians at the heart of s.91(24) of the Constitution. The regulation applies to appellants as hunters, not as Metis.","The appellants were convicted of unlawfully using a searchlight for the purpose of hunting wildlife contrary to s. 11.1(3) of the Saskatchewan Regulations passed pursuant to The Wildlife Act, 1998. The trial judge held that the appellants as Indians within the meaning of the Natural Resources Transfer Agreement (NRTA) did not have an Aboriginal right to hunt at night with an artificial light. HELD: The appeal was dismissed. 1)The trial judge correctly identified the test for justification of a legitimate regulation of a constitutional aboriginal right and the doctrine of interjurisdictional immunity. The focus has shifted to the limiting legislation in both Aboriginal and Treaty hunting rights cases. The appellants have failed to come within the provisions of s. 686(1)(a)(i) or s. 901 of the Code. 2)The appellant had aboriginal hunting rights protected by the Constitution. The NRTA in 1930 altered those hunting rights. The provisions of the Wildlife Act altered those rights by eliminating commercial hunting; by expanding the hunting area to include all unoccupied Crown land; and by authorizing the Province to make conservation laws. 3)The respondent acknowledges that if Metis are Indians they enjoy hunting rights within s. 12 of the NRTA. Their argument is that they are exempt from any hunting prohibition when hunting on unoccupied crown land.","[1] This is an appeal by Mervin Maurice and Walter Gardiner from their summary conviction on October 5, 2001, for unlawfully using a searchlight for the purpose of hunting wildlife, contrary to s. 11.1(3) of The Saskatchewan Regulations passed pursuant to The Wildlife Act, 1998. The issue in this case is whether the limiting legislation is a prima facie infringement on the appellants’ right to hunt for food and, if so, whether it is justifiable. Further, the trial judge concluded that the legislation could not be considered a diminution of any assumed aboriginal right. [18] The trial judge correctly identified the test for justification of a legitimate regulation of a constitutional aboriginal peoples’ right:
1. Does the legislation have avalid objective?

2. Is the honour of the Crown at stake in dealing with the Aboriginal peoples?

3. Has there been as little infringement as possible?

4. Has the Aboriginal group been consulted? But aboriginal rights are not absolute and, as already indicated, laws having a safety objective do not infringe aboriginal rights. The Province has jurisdiction to pass conservation laws. Section 11.1(3) restricts the method of hunting at night and to that extent it likely is a conservation infringement. CONCLUSION [27] It cannot be said that the findings of fact by the trial judge are unsupported by the evidence or are unreasonable. Nor should the decision be set aside on the ground of a wrong decision on a question of law. The appellants have failed to come within the provisions of s. 686(1)(a)(i) or (ii) of the Criminal Code. The appeal is dismissed.",0.31557377049180324,"An appeal from a summary conviction for unlawfully using a searchlight for the purpose of hunting. The trial judge made three distinct and alternate findings: based on the evidence presented, night hunting with an artificial light is so inherently dangerous as not to attract protection as an aboriginal right; based on the Sparrow test for prima facie infringement and justification, s.11.1(3) of the Regulations withstands both prima facie infringement and justifiability scrutiny; based on the authorities, s.11.1(3) of the Regulations does not touch the appellant's core as Indians and, therefore, does not give rise to interjurisdictional immunity. The trial judge found that aboriginal hunting rights must be exercised subject to any legislation that expresses legitimate safety concerns. The facts were not in dispute. The appellants, who were of Metis heritage and engaged in the traditional Metis way of life, argued they enjoy hunting rights within the meaning of s.12 of the Natural Resources Transfer Act and are exempt from any hunting prohibition when hunting on unoccupied Crown land. The respondent acknowledged that if they are Metis, they enjoy an aboriginal right to hunt for food as protected by s.35(1) of the Constitution Act, 1982. However, they are subject to the regulation prohibiting night hunting with artificial lights (except when hunting on a Reserve) because its primary objective is safety. At issue was whether the appellants, as Metis, are subject to s.11.1(3)of the Saskatchewan Regulations passed pursuant to the Wildlife Act. HELD: The appeal was dismissed. 1)The appellants failed to come within s.686(1)(a)(i) or (ii) of the Criminal Code. 2)The findings were supported by the evidence and were reasonable. There was no wrong decision on a question of law.  3)Aboriginal and Treaty rights are not absolute. Reasonable regulations aimed at ensuring safety do not infringe these rights. Laws having a safety objective do not infringe aboriginal rights. As safety legislation, s.13.1(3) has a conservation component. The Province has jurisdiction to pass conservation laws. Legislation prohibiting night hunting with artificial lights has been considered by the courts of several provinces. All courts found the practice dangerous and upheld the limiting provincial legislation. 4)The Court preferred the approach taken in R. v. Bernard, which is to consider safety as a factor in determining prima facie infringement and if necessary, justification pursuant to the Sparrow test. The issue in this case is whether the limiting legislation is a prima facie infringement on the appellants' right to hunt for food and if so, whether it is justifiable. Since Sparrow, it has become unnecessary and perhaps inappropriate to attempt to define aboriginal hunting rights. Sparrow presented three questions when deciding whether there has been a prima facie infringement of hunting rights: is the limitation reasonable; does the regulation cause undue hardship; does it deny their preferred means of exercising that right. In Seward and Bernard, the Sparrow test of infringement and justification was the only test applied. No infringement was found in either case. 5)The trial judge concluded the practice of night hunting by means of artificial light is highly dangerous. The prohibition was found not only to be reasonable but essential. The regulation presented no undue hardship and was never the preferred means of hunting by people of Sapwagamik. The legislation could not be considered a diminution of any assumed aboriginal right and there was thus no prima facie infringement of hunting rights by s.11.1(3).  6)It was not accepted that because Reserves are exempted, safety was not the primary purpose. Reserves were exempt out of respect for Band Council's right to pass their own safety laws pursuant to the Indian Act. 7)The trial judge correctly identified the test for justification of a legitimate regulation as being whether the legislation has a valid objective; whether the honour of the Crown is at stake; has there been as little infringement as possible; has the aboriginal group been consulted. 8)Section 11.1(3) restricts the method of hunting at night and to that extent it likely is a conservation infringement. If so, it is still permissible provincial legislation. It meets the Sparrow justification test because of the strong safety component. 9)Provincial hunting laws regulate aboriginal hunting rights; they do not extinguish them.

The appellants have failed to show any error in law by applying the justification test pursuant to Sparrow.  2)Solemn and historical Aboriginal rights protected by s.7 and s.8 of the Constitution Act, 1867, were clearly subject to federal and provincial legislation if the legislation does not constitute prima facie infringement of those rights. 3)The objective was primarally safety, both from the words used in the legislation and the evidence introduced.

2_2008nssm4.txt,"The Director of Residential Tenancies ordered compensation after he found that the landlord allowed mouldy conditions to develop in the premises and failed to rectify same, with the result that some of the tenant's belongings were ruined. The landlord appealed, taking the position that there had been no mould and the tenant had simply used grey spray paint to resemble mould. It was also questioned how the mould could only have affected the tenant's furniture and area rug but not be obvious on the other carpeting. Landlord's appeal dismissed; amount of damages ordered increased; the Director went too far in discounting the value of the tenant's belongings. The court relied on the by-law inspector's (who had been called in by the tenant) findings, finding it impossible to believe that he could have been fooled by something as amateurish as spray paint and that the tenant, had she actually resorted to such a tactic, would have called in a building inspector and hoped to get away with it.","This is an appeal from an order of the Director dated December 13, 2007 allowing the Tenant the sum of $787.50 against the Landlord as compensation arising from what the Director found to be a breach of the statutory condition to provide a premises suitable for habitation. The Landlord did not attend the hearing before the Director. It appears that she missed it inadvertently and she appeals to this Court against the findings. HELD: The damages were set at $862.50. Based on the Director's evidence, she discounted the value of the furniture, $50 for the area rug and $100 for the clothing. The Tenant will accordingly be entitled to judgment against the landlord for that revised amount.  1)The Director was essentially correct in her discounting of value of items of value. She was not credible and her explanation is not probable. 2)On a strong balance of probabilities that there was mould, that it was the landlord's responsibility to rectify same, and that she did not. Further find that the mould damaged the tenant's furniture, an area rug, various boots and articles of clothing and the clothing were ruined. 3)The Court rejected the director's evidence entirely. It was not reasonable to believe that she would have engaged in such a tactic. Having heard and assessed her as credible, the Court rejected her explanation entirely. There was no evidence that she could have been fooled by something as amateurish as spray paint.","[1] This is an appeal from an order of the Director dated December 13, 2007.

The Landlord had allowed mould to develop in her basement, which was riddled with mould. She also produced evidence of medical letters to the effect that her children suffered from asthma and ought not to be exposed to mould. The mother of two children testified that she was affected by the mould. Photographs of the mouldy conditions were placed in evidence. She testified that the landlord was totally unresponsive to her complaints throughout. She even used grey spray paint to resemble mould to resemble the mould, none of which had any bearing on the alleged mould issue. She questioned why if there was mould that only affected the Tenant's furniture and area rug and was not obvious on the other carpeting.

She was not credible and her explanation was not probable. 2) The damages were rejected.

The landlord appealed, taking the position that there had been no mould and the tenant had simply used grey spray paint to resemble mould. It was also questioned how the mould could only have affected the tenant's furniture and area rug but not be obvious on the other carpeting. Landlord's appeal dismissed; amount of damages ordered increased; the Director went too far in discounting the value of the tenant's belongings. The court relied on the by-law inspector's (who had been called in by the tenant) findings, finding it impossible to believe that he could have been fooled by something as amateurish as spray paint and that the tenant, had she actually resorted to such a tactic, would have called in a building inspector and hoped to get away with it.","The Landlord and Tenant appealed a decision of the Director allowing the Landlord the sum of $787.50 as compensation for a breach of the statutory condition to provide premises suitable for habitation. The Landlord had allowed mould to develop in her basement, which was riddled with mould. She also produced evidence of medical letters to the effect that her children suffered from asthma and ought not to be exposed to mould. The mother of two children testified that she was affected by the mould. Photographs of the mouldy conditions were placed in evidence. She testified that the landlord was totally unresponsive to her complaints throughout. She even used grey spray paint to resemble mould to resemble the mould, none of which had any bearing on the alleged mould issue. She questioned why if there was mould that only affected the Tenant's furniture and area rug and was not obvious on the other carpeting.

d_2009skqb44.txt,"The Ministry of Social Services seeks a 6 month order pursuant to s. 37(c) of The Child and Family Services Act with respect to the two children, NS is four years old and DS is two years old. DS was apprehended by the Ministry when he was born. Both NS and DS were the subject of a consent order for 6 months in October 2007. Both children have been in care for most of their lives. The Ministry requests a six month order with a proviso that it be for the purposes of allowing the Ministry to make long term placement plans for both children. The mother HH is not seeking a return of the children to her but supports the position of NOS, the father, who ask that the children be returned to him in his care. HELD: 1) If the children are returned to NOS, they will not receive a level of parenting that is above the minimal standard that will be tolerated by our society. Both children have some difficulties which must be managed carefully to ensure their continued growth and improvement. 2) Given the difficulties the parents struggle with, they can not provide that management. The Ministry has tendered substantial evidence of criminal activity on the part of NOS and police involvement in the life of HH. The criminal behaviour of NOS in and of itself would not disqualify him from parenting the children if the children were not exposed to that behaviour. There is a risk that the children may be exposed to such behaviour in the future. There is no evidence that NOS has done so in the past. The evidence of domestic violence is equivocal. There is evidence of consistent fighting and disruption of their relationship in the past. The Court finds that the relationship is unstable. The parents' addictions continue to loom large in their lives and relationship. The Court is not convinced that the father's addiction has been stabilized and is fully under control. There have been slip-ups and missed appointments at the methadone clinic. This should not be visited on the children. HH is even less advanced in dealing with her addictions than NOS. The evidence indicates good intentions but not the personal strength to take and complete programming whether offered by the methadone client, or ordered as a condition of the court. This is troubling because if the parents don't have the strength to achieve this, there is a question as to whether they have the personal strength to provide the minimal care for these children required by law on a day to day basis. 3) If the children are returned to NOS, they are likely to suffer physical and emotional harm. While the parents have had successful visits with the children while in care and had a period of some months where the children were apparently looked after by them, this does not convince the Court that they belong with NOS. The day to day stress of parenting is substantially different than visits of several hours. The evidence does not convince the Court that the children would receive consistent care month after month despite one past success in doing so. The children are in need of protection and should not be returned to NOS or HH. 4) Although the Ministry seeks a 6 month order with the notation that it is for the purposes of permanency planning, the Court is not inclined to make such an order. A 6 month order is premised on a reasonable prospect of change by the parents within a reasonable time. The parents have this opportunity to demonstrate that they are serious about changing their lives so that their children can be returned to them.",The Ministry of Social Services sought a six month order pursuant to s.37(c) of the Child and Family Services Act with respect to the two children. HELD: The order was granted with the condition that the children be returned to the father. The father was to continue living with the mother and the children while the mother attends to getting her addiction problems under control and then he would address his own addiction problems.  1) The father had a substantial criminal record which included 16 offences as youth. His youth offences were primarily property offences but primarily related to failing to comply with recognizances and probation orders. His last conviction was in January 2006 for failing to provide adequate drug screen results. 2) The mother was not seeking a return of the children to her directly but supported the position of the father who asked that they be returned in his care.,"The Ministry of Social Services (the Ministry) seeks a six month order pursuant to s. 37(c) of The Child and Family Services Act, S.S. 1989-90, c. C-7.2 (the “Act”) with respect to the two children. The Ministry requests a six month order with a proviso that it be for the purposes of allowing the Ministry to make long term placement plans for both children. [3] H.H., the mother, is not seeking a return of the children to her directly but supports the position of N.O.S., the father, who asks that the children be returned to him in his care. [62] In my view, the children, if they are returned to N.O.S., will not receive at this time a level of parenting that is above the minimal standard that will be tolerated by our society. I am not satisfied that either of N.O.S. and H.H., given their own difficulties, can provide that management based on my comments which follow. I find that the relationship is unstable. While both H.H. and N.O.S. are to be commended for their progress in this area, I am not convinced that the father’s addiction has been stabilized and is fully under control. [68] If the children are returned to N.O.S. I find that the children are likely to suffer physical and emotional harm if they continue to be exposed to the present addictions struggles of N.O.S. and H.H. who proposes to live with N.O.S. as they both attempt to get their addictions under control and as well their relational struggles. [70] While based on the evidence as a whole the parents have had successful visits with the children while in care and had a period of some months where the children were apparently looked after by them, this does not convince me that they belong with N.O.S. As well, at the moment the evidence as a whole does not convince me that the children would receive consistent care month after month despite one past success in doing so. [71] I therefore find that N.S. and D.S. are children in need of protection and should, at this point, not be returned to N.O.S. or H.H.

HELD: 1) If the children are returned to NOS, they will not receive a level of parenting that is above the minimal standard that will be tolerated by our society. Both children have some difficulties which must be managed carefully to ensure their continued growth and improvement. 2) Given the difficulties the parents struggle with, they can not provide that management. The Ministry has tendered substantial evidence of criminal activity on the part of NOS and police involvement in the life of HH. The criminal behaviour of NOS in and of itself would not disqualify him from parenting the children if the children were not exposed to that behaviour. There is a risk that the children may be exposed to such behaviour in the future. There is no evidence that NOS has done so in the past. The evidence of domestic violence is equivocal. There is evidence of consistent fighting and disruption of their relationship in the past. The Court finds that the relationship is unstable.

There have been slip-ups and missed appointments at the methadone clinic. This should not be visited on the children. HH is even less advanced in dealing with her addictions than NOS. The evidence indicates good intentions but not the personal strength to take and complete programming whether offered by the methadone client, or ordered as a condition of the court. This is troubling because if the parents don't have the strength to achieve this, there is a question as to whether they have the personal strength to provide the minimal care for these children required by law on a day to day basis. 3) If the children are returned to NOS, they are likely to suffer physical and emotional harm. While the parents have had successful visits with the children while in care and had a period of some months where the children were apparently looked after by them, this does not convince the Court that they belong with NOS.

The children are in need of protection and should not be returned to NOS or HH. 4) Although the Ministry seeks a 6 month order with the notation that it is for the purposes of permanency planning, the Court is not inclined to make such an order.

HELD: The order was granted. The children were to remain in the mother's care for six months and that the mother would continue to work with the Harm Reduction Methadone Program and take anger management courses. The father proposed that he would continue living with the mother and the children while the mother first attends to getting her addiction problems under control and then he would address his own addiction problems. The evidence showed that the father had a substantial criminal record, including 16 youth offences as youth. The convictions for youth offences were dated between May 2000 and June 2008 and the last conviction was in January 2006 for which he received 7 months incarceration. As the mother had been on the methadone program for most of her life, the father was aware that she was prone to addictions and had signed a PSA stating that the children would remain drug free and provide all drug screen results. Although the mother was not opposed to the father's proposal, she questioned the appropriateness of the wording of the PSA as to whether it was for the purposes of allowing the Ministry to make long term placement plans for both children. Regarding the father, he argued that he was not seeking a return of the children to the mother directly but that he had been advised by the Ministry that he planned on residing with her for the duration of the order and that if the mother did not cooperate with the Ministry's placement plans, he would be responsible for the children's health care expenses and the father would have to pay child support and the costs associated with the placement. The mother was to have regular weekly parenting time with the children and to have weekly two hour supervised visits with the father when the children were in the care of the Ministry. Although H.H. was represented by the mother, she did not testify and her history can only be gleaned from the documents which have been filed as exhibits and the testimony of others.","The Ministry of Social Services (the Ministry) seeks a six month order pursuant to s. 37(c) of The Child and Family Services Act, S.S. 1989-90, c.

One of the defendants, Dow Chemical, sought a declaration that the Court of Queen's Bench did not have jurisdiction to hear the action and to have the service ex juris set aside. Dow Chemical argued that there was no causal connection between it and the plaintiff's damages. HELD: The application was dismissed. The plaintiff was awarded her taxable costs in any event of the cause. It must be assumed that the allegations have a factual basis and liability may rest with the defendant, Dow Chemical, in both tort and contract, therefore it was considered appropriate to assume jurisdiction.  1)The Court did not have jurisdiction over the defendant on the basis of common law. The defendant is not resident in Saskatchewan and has no direct or real connection to the province. 2)The plaintiff is assumed to have suffered damages in both contract and tort. Applying Queen's Bench Rule 31(l)(f)(g) and the Moran case, the Court should assume jurisdiction absent any reason to the contrary. 3)Three of the four main topics in the statement of claim have reference to Dow Chemical: the failure to inform certain regulatory bodies and the public at large about the risk of breast implants; marketing and distributing the implants which were of non-merchantable quality and breach of warranties. 4)The final plea was that Dow Corning and Dow Chemical were in reality one and the same entity. It was thus suggested that the corporate veil should be pulled aside and any wrongful acts of Dow Corning should be treated as those of Dow Chemical. This differs significantly from vicarious liability where no fault is attributable to the third party but liability attaches because of the relationship.

[17] The Defendant in that claim, Pacific Home Products Ltd., filed a dispute note and became a Plaintiff in the Counterclaim against Dennis Ens and Anne Ens for recovery of the amount of $3,604.13, which they allege represents the losses incurred by Pacific Home Products Ltd. as a result of the frustration of the contract with Dennis Ens and Anne Ens. They then sued by way of Counterclaim against the Ens, Defendants in the Counterclaim for a balance, they believe owing to them, of $3,604.13. I find as a matter of fact in this case that it was not reasonably forseeable by either party. The contract as a result would be totally different from what the parties intended. I find that the supervening event was beyond the control of both parties and resulted in a significant change in the original obligation assumed by them. [27] Based on the facts as I find them, and the applicable law, I find the contract was frustrated. I find that the Plaintiff Ens has failed to prove that claim on a balance of probabilities. I find that the Plaintiff in the counterclaim, Pacific Home Products Ltd. failed to prove that claim on a balance of probabilities. [32] Considering all the facts presented in the case, I find that a just and reasonable resolution demands that the value of the expenses lost due to the frustration of the contract should be borne by the parties in a 65/35 ratio. I find that Pacific Home Products Ltd. should bear 65% of the loss and Dennis Ens and Anne Ens, 35% of the loss.

They attended trade show and met the defendant, whose corporation had been in the business of building decks and sunrooms for 18 years. The plaintiffs contracted with the defendant to build their sunroom. The contract called for the provision of ten-foot deep, ten inch diameter concrete pilings to be the foundation for the deck upon which would sit glass sunroom. This provision was fundamental element in the contract. The type and design of the foundation was critical to the mutual satisfaction of both parties and the overall success of the installation in both the short and long term. The contract was frustrated when it was discovered that the intended foundation could not be constructed due to the high ground water in the town of Warman and specifically on the job site.  The plaintiffs sued the defendant for the return of their $2,200.00 deposit. The defendant filed a dispute note and counterclaimed for a balance they believed was owed to them of $3,604.13. HELD: There will be a judgment in favour of the plaintiffs against the defendant in the amount of $176.22. In the circumstances, there will be no order as to costs. Based on the facts and the applicable law, the contract was frustrated. The frustrating event or circumstance occurred after the formation of the contract. It was not reasonably foreseeable by either party. The change affected the fundamental nature of the contract. The event was permanent and non-transient. The contract as a result would be totally different from what the parties intended. The difference was much more than mere inconvenience. The supervening event was beyond the control of both parties and resulted in a significant change in the original obligation assumed by them. Both parties acted in good faith. The plaintiffs submitted that the defendant abandoned the contract. The court finds that the plaintiff has failed to prove that claim on a balance of probabilities. The defendant, in its counterclaim, submitted that the plaintiffs repudiated the contract. The court finds that the defendant (plaintiff in the counterclaim) failed to prove that claim on a balance of probabilities. Considering all the facts presented in the case, the court finds that a just and reasonable resolution demands that the value of the expenses lost due to the frustration of the contract should be borne by the parties on a 65/35 ratio: the defendant should bear 65% of the loss, and the plaintiffs should bear 35% of the loss. The plaintiffs and the defendant were not on an equal plane. The plaintiffs relied on the contractor's experience to some degree, although not entirely. The defendant corporation may be able to further mitigate its losses over the course of time by using more parts salvaged from the material left over in the failed project. Further, the corporation will be able to write off this loss over the course of time.","The plaintiffs sued the defendant corporation for the return of a substantial amount of money. The defendant corporation was in the business of building decks and sunrooms and had been for 18 years. The plaintiff wanted to construct a glass sunroom on the back of their home and had obtained a detailed quotation from Pacific Home Products Ltd. for the construction of a concrete pad and pillar system. After the land purchase contract was entered into, and prior to construction, the defendant changed the material used in the project to concrete pilings which would be used as foundation support. The defendants then sued the plaintiff in a counterclaim for $3,604.13, which represented the defendant's misappropriation of funds from the plaintiff. In the counterclaim, the plaintiff argued that the defendant breached its contractual obligation by failing to pay the plaintiff $2,200.13 deposit which it was entitled to on a 65/35 ratio. Each party will bear the risk of its own lost expenses. The contract was clearly frustrated by the unforseen soil conditions which prevented the drilling of ten foot depth pile holes for concrete piles. Neither party could have foreseen this issue.

The Crown appealed on the ground that the trial judge erred respecting arbitrary detention and the exclusion of evidence of the breathalyzer test. Issues The respondent had been randomly stopped by police officer in a bar. The stop was conducted in order to check licences, insurance, and, if not for a breath test, to look at the driver's licence and proof of insurance. After the stop, the officer asked the respondent to accompany her back to the police cruiser. The respondent refused and the officer told the respondent that he would be charged with failing to provide a breath sample and that he was to lose and instruct counsel without delay. The trial judge concluded that although the stop was arbitrary, it was justified because it was urgent and that the breath sample be obtained quickly. The police officer's actions in stopping the appellant were therefore statutorily authorized by s. 119 of the Highway Traffic Act. Issues Issues The focus of inquiry in this appeal is on the period between the engagement of the police emergency lights and the decision whether or not to give the breathalyzer demand. While the issues in R. v. Bernshaw arose from a decision of the British Columbia Court of Appeal rejecting the results of an ALERT test when the police officer had not waited for 15 minutes before administering it, the same time period was relevant and the Supreme Court made a number of observations providing useful guidance. The gravamen of the case for the defence was not whether the officer had reasonable and probable grounds for making the breath demand but whether there was a breach of s. of s.'s Charter because the search only took place following the arbitrary detention of the appellant. HELD: The appeal is allowed and the conviction is quashed. 1)The trial judge did not give consideration to the potential application of section 9. It is not necessary to reduce within specific limits the general terms in which the duties of a police officer are expressed. The flexible approach struck the proper balance between Parliament's objective in combatting the evils of drinking and driving and the rights of citizens to be free from unreasonable search and seizure. The strong police presence in the area helped to prevent the spread of impaired driving. 2)The unreasonable detention and detention suffered by the appellant was demonstrably justified.","THE COURT: The appeal is allowed, the conviction restored.

Issues The respondent had been randomly stopped by police officer in a bar. The stop was conducted in order to check licences, insurance, and, if not for a breath test, to look at the driver's licence and proof of insurance. After the stop, the officer asked the respondent to accompany her back to the police cruiser. The respondent refused and the officer told the respondent that he would be charged with failing to provide a breath sample and that he was to lose and instruct counsel without delay. The trial judge concluded that although the stop was arbitrary, it was justified because it was urgent and that the breath sample be obtained quickly. The police officer's actions in stopping the appellant were therefore statutorily authorized by s. 119 of the Highway Traffic Act. Issues Issues The focus of inquiry in this appeal is on the period between the engagement of the police emergency lights and the decision whether or not to give the breathalyzer demand. While the issues in R. v. Bernshaw arose from a decision of the British Columbia Court of Appeal rejecting the results of an ALERT test when the police officer had not waited for 15 minutes before administering it, the same time period was relevant and the Supreme Court made a number of observations providing useful guidance. The gravamen of the case for the defence was not whether the officer had reasonable and probable grounds for making the breath demand but whether there was a breach of s. of s.'s Charter because the search only took place following the arbitrary detention of the appellant. HELD: The appeal is allowed and the conviction is quashed. 1)The trial judge did not give consideration to the potential application of section 9. It is not necessary to reduce within specific limits the general terms in which the duties of a police officer are expressed. The flexible approach struck the proper balance between Parliament's objective in combatting the evils of drinking and driving and the rights of citizens to be free from unreasonable search and seizure. The strong police presence in the area helped to prevent the spread of impaired driving. 2)The unreasonable detention and detention suffered by the appellant was demonstrably justified.","THE COURT: The appeal is allowed, the conviction restored. The Crown has appealed on the ground that the summary conviction appeal court erred respecting arbitrary detention and the exclusion of evidence of the breathalyzer result under s. 24(2) of the Charter. When this is read in the context of the common law authority of police to control traffic on the highways, other provisions of the Motor Vehicle Act and provisions of the Criminal Code, and note is taken of long standing customary practices, I am left in no doubt that s. 83(1) authorizes peace officers to require vehicles on the highway to come to a stop in response to an appropriate order, signal or direction. The detention was arbitrary, since the decision as to whether the stop should be made lay in the absolute discretion of the police officers. In these circumstances there was no improper intervention by the officer in conscripting him against himself or which violated his reasonable expectations of privacy. Accordingly I would allow the appeal on this ground and restore the conviction entered by Judge Crowell.",0.14035087719298245,"The appellant was convicted of driving with an illegal blood alcohol level after trial in Provincial Court.

The Commission overturned the decision of the stewards and restored the horse declared to be in first place. In issue was whether the hearsay opinions of stewards from other jurisdictions were admissible; whether the Commission exceeded its jurisdiction by overturning the steward's decision to disqualify the horse; whether the Commission breached the rules of natural justice by failing to give notice of the hearing to the applicants. The respondents contended the privative clause in the Act gives the Commission the right to interpret the notice provisions of its empowering statute subject only to judicial review on the patently unreasonable standard. HELD: The application was allowed and the decision of the Commission was quashed. The matter was remitted to the Commission to be dealt with according to law after the appropriate notices have been given to the applicants. 1)The opinions were not only inadmissible as hearsay but were irrelevant to the present proceedings.  2)The law is well established that the Court in certiorari proceedings is restricted to determining whether or not the inferior statutory tribunal acted within its jurisdiction or there is an error on the face of the record.

The commissioned salesman who was examined as the proper officer of the plaintiff gave evidence at the examination for discovery that he did not communicate the prices listed on his pricing sheet to the defendants but was adamant at trial that he had. HELD: The claim for rectification was dismissed. 1)The testimony of the president and general manager was not accepted. He signed the company's standard agreement which indicated that the price of the basement was included in the agreement. The salesman's evidence that he provided an approximate price contradicted his own notations and the notation was consistent with the evidence of the defendants.  2)A party seeking rectification must establish that the parties were of one mind as to the terms of the contract and the written record does not properly record that common intention. 3)The evidence was not clear as to when an interest rate of 15% was inserted into the document and the court was not satisfied that there was an agreement to pay interest.

It cannot accept that the plaintiff admits that he provided an approximate price on an RTM and basement. There was a mutual or common mistake in the written expression of the agreement and rectification may be made upon satisfying the Court that there is an actual concluded agreement.

8_1990canlii4256.txt,"Where a child's testimony as to repeated acts of sexual assault was not accurate as to precise details of the time and place of the events, but was otherwise reasonable and consistent, the inexactitude did not destroy the child's credibility. Evidence of an expert specializing in recognizing symptoms of child sexual abuse was admissible evidence to assist the trial judge in assessing whether an assault took place. However, evidence of the complainant's school counsellor was inadmissible as hearsay, but notwithstanding, its admission was not so grave an error as to call for a quashing of the conviction. The conviction was determined to have been a verdict which a jury acting judicially could reasonably have rendered.","The appellant was convicted of sexually assaulting his 11 year old stepdaughter. The medical evidence established beyond doubt that the complainant had been the victim of repeated acts of both vaginal and anal intercourse. The only issue, therefore, was the identity of the person who committed such sexual assaults. The trial judge found the complainant's evidence had been consistent throughout and had been given in a reasonable manner 'worthy of belief'. The Crown also called a social worker trained in counselling. The social worker testified that she interviewed the complainant and others involved in the case and concluded that the child exhibited many of the symptoms often found in children who have been sexually abused, such as depression, attempts to block out recollection of events, low self-esteem, lack of trust in others and an inability to be specific as to details. Dismissing the appeal, that even though the complainant must have been mistaken as to the number of Friday nights she was sexually molested, such a misconception on her part, under all the circumstances of this case, does not destroy her credibility.","THE COURT: Appeal dismissed per oral reasons for judgment of Macdonald, J.A.; Hallett and Chipman, JJ.A. concurring. ""...While children may not be able to recount precise details and communicate the when and where of an event with exactitude, this does not mean that they have misconceived what happened to them and who did it. In recent years we have adopted a much more benign attitude to children\'s evidence, lessening the strict standards of oath taking and corroboration, and I believe that this is a desirable development. The credibility of every witness who testifies before the courts must, of course, be carefully assessed but the standard of the \'reasonable adult\' is not necessarily appropriate is assessing the credibility of young children."" The question then is whether the admission of the hearsay evidence of Miss. V. was an error so grave as to call for a quashing of the conviction.

9_1999canlii12597.txt,"The petitioner obtained an ex parte order under the Family Maintenance Act which restrains the Attorney General from paying any money owing under an action in Queen's Bench to the respondent and his solicitor and restraining the respondent from disposing of any monies received in the action. The respondent applies to have the order set aside. The respondent argues that a restraining order under the Act is a preservation of property order and should not be granted because the petitioner has not met the tests that govern the granting of such orders. He submits that the criteria for the granting of a preservation order is the same as for a interlocutory injunction. The respondent argues that before the Court can exercises its discretion and grant an order, is should have some evidence that the party being restrained would defeat a claim under the Act. HELD: The Court is satisfied that the respondent's personal claim for damages is the only asset the he has to satisfy the claim under the Act. Without prejudicing the applicant's claim, the Court will arbitrarily determine that the sum of $40,000 will likely be sufficient security. For the time being, the order will attach to the first $40,000 of funds received by the respondent, if and when any amount becomes payable to him. The parties may apply to vary this amount in future. Costs are reserved to be dealt with on the hearing of the application for maintenance. The Court is not satisfied that the jurisprudence with respect to injunctive remedies based on inherent jurisdiction of the court applies to an application under s.8 of the Act. If the criteria for granting a restraining order under the Act were meant to be the same, there would be no need for the unique provision of the Act. As s.8 was enacted to provide a solution where none had existed, the Court must primarily look to the statute itself for a determination of the appropriate considerations. Section 8 of the Act grants the Court the authority to restrain the disposition of assets and creates a new, but limited, form of injunctive relief with this remedy being available solely to prevent the impairment or defeat of the Act. The statute does not require the Court to be satisfied that the respondent is hindering or defeating a claim. When a respondent has only one asset that could reasonably satisfy a claim, his dependents and society as a whole have an interest in ensuring that the asset will be used for such purpose.","The petitioner obtained an ex parte order under s. 8(1) of The Family Maintenance Act (the “Act”) which restrains the Attorney General of Canada from releasing or paying any monies to the respondent or his solicitors in relation to their claim in Queen’s Bench Action No. 2270/97, J.C.Reg.

The testator and his wife had executed mirror wills in 2012. His wife died in September 2013, and within two days of her death the testator had signed a new will. It was based on his first will with some revisions. The value of the estate was approximately $343,000 and the will made bequests of $100 to the applicant and another daughter. The testator left the rest and residue of the estate divided into equal shares between his three other daughters. The applicant deposed that at the time the testator’s wife was dying, she visited him and found him to be very confused. When the testator’s lawyer came to meet with him as his wife was dying, the applicant stated that the testator said he did not remember the lawyer and would not sign anything. The only other evidence submitted by the applicant was a letter from the testator’s physician, who reported that he saw the testator in early September 2012 and that he was then alert and could recognize him. The evidence presented by the two daughters who were named as executors of the will consisted of their own affidavits and the affidavits of a friend of the testator; a bank official who had prepared a power of attorney for the testator made at the time of the death of his wife; and the lawyer who prepared the original 2012 wills and the 2013 will. The contents of the various affidavits deposed to the testator’s estranged relationship with the applicant and her sister, his intention to exclude the applicant from his will, and that he appeared to be mentally capable. The lawyer’s affidavit deposed that at the initial meeting that she attended with the testator when his wife was dying, he was devastated by grief and she did not take any instructions. When she met with him again to take instructions regarding his new will, she kept notes of them—the testator had expressly instructed her to make sure that the two daughters would get nothing except for the specific bequests.

The court held that the applicant’s evidence in support of the challenge to the will was extremely thin and the descriptions of the testator’s behaviour did not raise doubt regarding his capacity regarding his property and his disposition of it.

2009nssc86.txt,"The applicant applied under the Civil Procedure Rules (1972) for an order of mandamus compelling the respondent department to comply with a prior order of the Income Assistance Appeal Board. The applicant was denied income assistance for failure to supply requested information. He appealed the decision and the appeal board ordered his income assistance be reinstated. The respondent refused to reinstate assistance and made a request for additional information. Eventually, the applicant supplied the requested information and his assistance was reinstated. He sought retroactive amounts for the period falling between the appeal board's order and the time of reinstatement. Order granted, costs to the applicant in the amount of $750: assistance to be reinstated retroactively according to the time frame ordered by the appeal board. The respondent's argument that the applicant should be required to appeal their most recent decision on eligibility must be rejected. It would not be appropriate to require the applicant to appeal the respondent's refusal to abide by an existing appeal decision. To allow the respondent to ignore the appeal board's ruling and request additional information effectively undermines the appeal board's authority and makes a ruling by them meaningless.

4_2009skqb403.txt,"The petitioner is a 39 year old nurse. She is legally married to Mr. McPhail and together they are the biological parents of three children. The petitioner separated from Mr. McPhail in October 2001 after the petitioner became romantically involved with the respondent, Dr. Hunt. The petitioner and the respondent began cohabitating sometime between November 2002 (according to her) and September 2003 (according to him). They separated in July 2008. The petitioner now commences a petition in which she claims relief from the respondent, Dr. Hunt, under The Family Property Act, The Children's Law Act, 1997 and The Family Maintenance Act, 1997. The three issues to be determined on this application are whether the petitioner has established a prima facie case that the respondent stood in loco parentis to the children such as to justify an interim child support order, whether the petitioner has established that she is entitled to interim spousal support and whether the Court should order an interim distribution of matrimonial property in favour of the petitioner in the amount of $20,000. HELD: 1) The petitioner has fallen short of establishing a prima facie case that the respondent stood in loco parentis to the children. The Court cannot make a determination based on conflicting affidavits. The determination will have to be made after trial. 2) There is no dispute the parties cohabitated as spouses for in excess of 2 years and that she is a spouse by virtue of the legislation. The principles in Marcotte v. Marcotte, 2008 SKQB 223 apply to the present case. In 2008 the respondent reported income of over $267,000, he has the ability to pay. The petitioner has annual income of over $71,000. Although the parties had a combined income of over $350,000 while they were together, it appears that their assets after their liabilities are deducted will result in a minimal net worth. The Court concludes that the petitioner is in need of some financial assistance, albeit not to the degree that she has suggested. A modest transfer of funds from the respondent to the petitioner should alleviate the majority of her negative cash flow problems. The petitioner's cohabitation with the respondent can only be described as short term. A spousal support payment of $1,500 per month is an appropriate interim amount. The payments will be paid for a total of 8 months.  3) Paying any money to any party at this stage does not meet the criteria set forth in the decisions of this Court. It is far from certain whether any money will be flowing from the respondent to the petitioner. The application for an interim distribution of family property is dismissed.","The applicant is 39 years old licensed practical nurse who is employed with the Mamawetan Health Region. She is married to a self-employed carpenter who also lives in La Ronge. They have three children. The applicant commenced a petition in October 2008 in which she claims relief under The Family Property Act, S.S. 1997, The Children's Law Act, 1997, and Family Maintenance Act 1997. HELD: The application for interim relief was dismissed without prejudice to the petitioner's right to claim child support. 1)It is now well established in this jurisdiction that the court can, and should, make an interim order for child support in disputed in loco parentis cases where the applicant has made a prima facie case for entitlement. The fact that one is not the biological parent does not necessarily mean that one may not be legally required to provide maintenance for his or her child. 2)The circumstances of the'rent' that the applicant claims she pays are somewhat cloudy. After the separation, she moved back to the residence on Sinotte Crescent. She claims that she pays rent in the amount of $150.68 weekly (which amounts to $7,835.36 yearly). The credit card entry is double entry in that it is not an expense not already covered by the other expenses. When the petitioner caught wind of the fact that items were being sold, she was able to convince the local business person to forward the sale proceeds from these items to her lawyer, where they currently are held in trust.","[5] Ms. McPhail commenced a petition on October 14, 2008, in which she claims relief under The Family Property Act, S.S. 1997, c. F-6.3, The Children’s Law Act, 1997, S.S. 1997, c. C-8.2, and The Family Maintenance Act, 1997, S.S. 1997, c. F-6.2. Although Dr. Hunt did not specifically consent to Ms. McPhail’s application for sole custody, in light of the position that Dr. Hunt takes on the other issues, there is no opposition to Ms. McPhail’s request, and it is appropriate to grant Ms. McPhail the relief that she seeks respecting sole custody. [10] Accordingly, there will be an order that Ms. McPhail shall have sole custody of her three children, namely: Jordan Darcy Rex McPhail, date of birth January 9, 1993 (16), Mitchell Kenneth Lloyd McPhail, date of birth May 6, 1995 (14), Chase Aaron Joshua McPhail, date of birth October 3, 1999 (9). 1. Has Ms. McPhail established a prima facie case that Dr. Hunt stood in loco parentis to the children such as to justify an interim child support order? [23] In this case, based on the affidavit material before me, I conclude that Ms. McPhail has fallen short of establishing a prima facie case that Dr. Hunt stood in loco parentis to the children. Dr. Hunt may have stood in loco parentis to the children, however I cannot determine that on the conflicting affidavit materials currently before me. [25] There is no dispute that Ms. McPhail and Dr. Hunt cohabited as spouses for in excess of two years, and that she is a “spouse” by virtue of the definition in the Act. [32] Also, although the parties had combined incomes approaching $350,000 per annum, it appears that their assets, after deducting their liabilities, result in a minimal net worth. [33] Given all of these somewhat unusual factors, I conclude that Ms. McPhail is in need of some financial assistance, albeit not to the degree that she has suggested. A modest transfer of funds from Dr. Hunt to Ms. McPhail, in the interim, should alleviate the majority of her negative cash flow problem. Taking into account all of these factors, the relevant legislative enactments and the legal principles that have been consistently applied in this province, I conclude that a spousal support payment of $1,500 per month is the appropriate interim amount that ought to be paid and should be sufficient to relieve her from some of the economic hardship that she has encountered as a result of the matrimonial breakdown. [34] Accordingly, I order that Dr. Hunt pay to Ms. McPhail the sum of $1,500 per month commencing September 1, 2009. However, given the short-term relationship and to add impetus to having the issues resolved sooner rather than later, I order that these payments be paid for a total period of eight months. Accordingly, Ms. McPhail’s application for an interim distribution of family property is dismissed.",0.11360634081902246,"The petitioner is a 39 year old nurse.

F-6.3, The Children’s Law Act, 1997, S.S. 1997, c. C-8.2, and The Family Maintenance Act, 1997, S.S. 1997, c. F-6.2. Although Dr. Hunt did not specifically consent to Ms. McPhail’s application for sole custody, in light of the position that Dr. Hunt takes on the other issues, there is no opposition to Ms. McPhail’s request, and it is appropriate to grant Ms. McPhail the relief that she seeks respecting sole custody. [10] Accordingly, there will be an order that Ms. McPhail shall have sole custody of her three children, namely: Jordan Darcy Rex McPhail, date of birth January 9, 1993 (16), Mitchell Kenneth Lloyd McPhail, date of birth May 6, 1995 (14), Chase Aaron Joshua McPhail, date of birth October 3, 1999 (9). 1. Has Ms. McPhail established a prima facie case that Dr. Hunt stood in loco parentis to the children such as to justify an interim child support order? [23] In this case, based on the affidavit material before me, I conclude that Ms. McPhail has fallen short of establishing a prima facie case that Dr. Hunt stood in loco parentis to the children. Dr. Hunt may have stood in loco parentis to the children, however I cannot determine that on the conflicting affidavit materials currently before me. [25] There is no dispute that Ms. McPhail and Dr. Hunt cohabited as spouses for in excess of two years, and that she is a “spouse” by virtue of the definition in the Act. [32] Also, although the parties had combined incomes approaching $350,000 per annum, it appears that their assets, after deducting their liabilities, result in a minimal net worth. [33] Given all of these somewhat unusual factors, I conclude that Ms. McPhail is in need of some financial assistance, albeit not to the degree that she has suggested. A modest transfer of funds from Dr. Hunt to Ms. McPhail, in the interim, should alleviate the majority of her negative cash flow problem. Taking into account all of these factors, the relevant legislative enactments and the legal principles that have been consistently applied in this province, I conclude that a spousal support payment of $1,500 per month is the appropriate interim amount that ought to be paid and should be sufficient to relieve her from some of the economic hardship that she has encountered as a result of the matrimonial breakdown. [34] Accordingly, I order that Dr. Hunt pay to Ms. McPhail the sum of $1,500 per month commencing September 1, 2009. However, given the short-term relationship and to add impetus to having the issues resolved sooner rather than later, I order that these payments be paid for a total period of eight months. Accordingly, Ms. McPhail’s application for an interim distribution of family property is dismissed.",0.23759791122715407,"The petitioner is a 39 year old nurse. She is legally married to Mr. McPhail and together they are the biological parents of three children. The petitioner separated from Mr. McPhail in October 2001 after the petitioner became romantically involved with the respondent, Dr. Hunt. The petitioner and the respondent began cohabitating sometime between November 2002 (according to her) and September 2003 (according to him). They separated in July 2008. The petitioner now commences a petition in which she claims relief from the respondent, Dr. Hunt, under The Family Property Act, The Children's Law Act, 1997 and The Family Maintenance Act, 1997. The three issues to be determined on this application are whether the petitioner has established a prima facie case that the respondent stood in loco parentis to the children such as to justify an interim child support order, whether the petitioner has established that she is entitled to interim spousal support and whether the Court should order an interim distribution of matrimonial property in favour of the petitioner in the amount of $20,000. HELD: 1) The petitioner has fallen short of establishing a prima facie case that the respondent stood in loco parentis to the children. The Court cannot make a determination based on conflicting affidavits. The determination will have to be made after trial. 2) There is no dispute the parties cohabitated as spouses for in excess of 2 years and that she is a spouse by virtue of the legislation. The principles in Marcotte v. Marcotte, 2008 SKQB 223 apply to the present case. In 2008 the respondent reported income of over $267,000, he has the ability to pay. The petitioner has annual income of over $71,000. Although the parties had a combined income of over $350,000 while they were together, it appears that their assets after their liabilities are deducted will result in a minimal net worth. The Court concludes that the petitioner is in need of some financial assistance, albeit not to the degree that she has suggested. A modest transfer of funds from the respondent to the petitioner should alleviate the majority of her negative cash flow problems. The petitioner's cohabitation with the respondent can only be described as short term. A spousal support payment of $1,500 per month is an appropriate interim amount. The payments will be paid for a total of 8 months.  3) Paying any money to any party at this stage does not meet the criteria set forth in the decisions of this Court. It is far from certain whether any money will be flowing from the respondent to the petitioner. The application for an interim distribution of family property is dismissed.","The applicant is 39 years old licensed practical nurse who is employed with the Mamawetan Health Region.

The guardian appealed SGI's decision that the children were not entitled to any additional benefits. She argued that since the money paid was in relation to the youngest child, who in the circumstances took the place of a surviving spouse, the death benefit becomes fixed at $47,427, and the formula used in s.146(1) would be half of the income replacement benefit(the IRB) that the deceased would have been entitled to had she survived the accident.

In September 2004, clarification of the May 27 2004 fiat was sought. HELD: The questions raised by the parties together with the disparate positions taken by the participants demonstrate the confusion as to the nature of the action and of a party's rights and responsibilities within the action. The action is a derivative one in which the action by plaintiff, 609, proceeds for the benefit of 609 against those it alleges to have caused it loss or damage. Henry is empowered and obliged to appoint counsel for 609. Such counsel is entitled to have access to the relevant documents, records and employees for the purposes of the action. It follows that Henry and that counsel have professional and fiduciary obligations to 609. Henry's overall instructions to counsel should not be in conflict with the interests of 609 as Henry is obliged to advance the corporate interests in the derivative action. As no formal motion was brought in this proceeding and the matter proceeded with all parties consenting, there shall be no order as to costs. Henceforth, it is the plaintiff and the defendants, who have status in these proceedings, and not Henry, in his personal capacity, or the board of directors of 609.","FIAT.

In September 2004 clarification was requested and, with the consent of the plaintiff, Ms. Ouellette for the defendants and Mr. Agnew for the board of directors, the matter proceeded by conference call and written submissions. HELD: 1) It is the plaintiff and the defendants who have status in these proceedings and not Henry in his personal capacity nor the directors of the company in this case. 2) As a corporation, a corporation may only litigate with legal representation, Henry is empowered and obliged to appointed counsel for 609. Whether that counsel is Mr. Brehon, another member of his firm or someone from outside that firm is entirely matter for Henry. Such counsel is entitled to access to the relevant documents, records and employees for the purposes of the action, including preparation of a statement as to documents and following the modified discovery process set out in my earlier fiat. 3) Questions 4 and 5, and the first branch of question are self-evident once one accepts the unity of interest between Henry and 609 which is necessarily reflected in the decision authorizing the derivative action. It follows that Henry's overall instructions to counsel should not be in conflict with the interests of the 609 as Henry is obliged to advance the corporate interests in the derivative act. He was appointed for that purpose and is obligated to so instruct 609's counsel.

(4th) 98 held that an employee who submitted a bid for a food services contract in competition to her employer during a period of working notice was in breach of her employment contract. I therefore find that Sullivan breached his duty of fidelity to the plaintiff. [27] However I am not satisfied that the plaintiff proved it would have been in a position to perform further work for PCS if Sullivan had not submitted a proposal. [31] Sullivan was not in a managerial position with the plaintiff. He did have the experience suggested by Fortney but I do not consider that to be confidential information or a trade secret. I likewise hold that the plaintiff in this case is entitled to no more than nominal damages. I also award it $500.00. [34] In the result PCS is entitled to costs against the plaintiff and the plaintiff is entitled to costs against Sullivan.,0.20187793427230044,"The plaintiff claims damages against the defendant for breach of contract and breach of fiduciary duty. The defendant entered into a contract with the plaintiff for term of two months. The contract was extended by PCS in mid-April and then again in June until the end of September. The plaintiff alleges that the contract was also extended for further three months from September 30 until December 2005. The trial judge concluded that the respondent was deriving benefit from both his employer and from competitor. He also found that although the giving of unreasonable notice constituted a fundamental breach of the employment contract, the defendant had not elected to treat the contract as being at an end when given notice of her dismissal. The employment contract had not terminated until October 7, 1995. The claim against PCS is dismissed. HELD: The plaintiff is entitled to costs against the plaintiff and the plaintiff is awarded costs against Sullivan. 1)The trial judge erred in characterizing the employee's actions as mere preparation. The employee competed with her employer for business which had been the employer's; her placing of the bid went beyond preparation. 2)The plaintiff proved it would have been in a position to perform further work for PCS if Sullivan had not submitted a proposal. 3)The court found no case law on point in this province and was unable to distinguish Sullivan's actions from those of Restauronics.",0.19819819819819817

The family property was divided equally from the date the action was commenced. The legislation does not permit an exemption in the circumstances for the $12,000 from the sale of the respondent's trailer used to purchase the acreage. It was concluded the respondent's father owned the tractor. Two other tractors were exempt and a partial exemption was allowed for a snowmobile and some tools.

An appraisal of the farm land and out buildings was done and the report filed. Absent any evidence to the contrary, the respondent's testimony was accepted. HELD: 1) The farm machinery comprises major portion of the family property. Over the years the respondent has owned several machines and this began before the marriage. The petitioner has received no benefit from these expenses. For example, she received no income from the farm since the separation. Therefore, she should bear no responsibility for the payments made. 2) The debts submitted by the respondent which believe should be taken into account are those of $856.00 plus $1,000 for money she borrowed from a friend to make a payment on account of legal fees. 3) The respondent sold his trailer and the sale proceeds of $12,000 were used to purchase the acreage. There is a serious dispute in respect to what pieces of machinery constitute family property; what exemptions are available to the respondent; and what value should be attributed to the equipment which is subject to distribution. These debts were referred to three appraisals; one done at the behest of the petitioner and two at the respondent, with the sole purpose of fixing the value of the machinery at $800. 4) The petitioner was awarded judgment against the respondent in the sum of $51,725.82 together with taxable costs of the action.","[1] This is an action in which the petitioner seeks a distribution of family property in accordance with The Family Property Act, S.S. c. F-6.3. [3] In the circumstances, the family property should be divided equally. He testified that prior to the marriage he owned a Case 800 tractor and a J.D. 400 mix mill. Accordingly, I find them to be exempt. As a result, I allow a partial exemption and in doing so fix the value of the snowmobile at $800.00. As a result, while the respondent owned a truck prior to the marriage it cannot be traced to the subject truck. To this must be added $2,400.00 for the automobile and boat resulting in a total of $33,257.31. [30] In summary, the value of livestock to be distributed as between the parties is as follows. However, as best I can make out, it was acquired prior to the marriage. Accordingly, I treat it as being exempt. [35] There is a claim for $16,500.00 which is said to be owing to the father for the Versatile 160 tractor. I have already found that the father owns the tractor. I therefore reject this suggested debt. [36] Next there is a claim in respect to monies allegedly owing to the father in respect to the Case 970, the 1155 tractor and the I.H. truck. Both are statute barred and I therefore decline to take them into account. Finally, there is a debt of $1,200.00 supposedly owed to the father in respect to the Morris rod weeder. I am not convinced this is actually owing and therefore reject it. [37] Over a period of time the respondent paid out monies on account of fertilizer, chemicals, fuel, repairs, parts and insurance. Accordingly, she should bear no responsibility for the payments made and I decline to take them into consideration. The petitioner also claims a debt of $1,000.00 for money she borrowed from a friend to make a payment on account of legal fees. I do not consider this to be a matrimonial debt. CONCLUSION [41] In the result, the petitioner will have judgment against the respondent in the sum of $51,725.82 together with taxable costs of the action.",0.23404255319148937,"The petitioner sought a distribution of family property in accordance with the Family Property Act.

2_2008nsca28.txt,"The worker was unsuccessful in his claim for compensation for gradual onset stress when the Workers' Compensation Appeal Tribunal (WCAT) found that the conditions in his workplace did not constitute unusual or excessive stressors as required under the terms of the relevant Board policy. The worker appealed, arguing, inter alia, that the WCAT erred in finding that his subjective reaction to the stressors in the workplace was not relevant. Appeal dismissed; the WCAT correctly applied the objective approach in determining whether there were workplace events or stressors sufficient to support a claim for gradual onset stress. The Board policy reflected the previous applicable law; namely, that workplace events and stressors must be unusual and excessive in comparison to the work- related events or stressors experienced by an average worker in the same or similar occupation.","The Workers' Compensation Appeals Tribunal (WCAT) held that the workplace stressors experienced by the respondent worker were not unusual and excessive in comparison to those experienced by an average worker in the same or similar occupation. WCAT applied the correct legal test in this case, which was reviewed for correctness. The issue was whether WCAT was wrong to take this approach and if so, whether it applied it unreasonably to the worker's situation. HELD: The appeal was dismissed. The policy provides that both gradual onset and traumatic event stressors are compensable under the Government Employees Compensation Act (GECA) and sets out the conditions under which each type of stress is compensable. The Policy also sets out certain legal principles that must be met. The first requirement is that the stressors must be excessively and unusually stressful, objectively viewed and, in the actual case of the individual worker, give rise to the mental or physical condition on which the claim is based. The second requirement is the exclusion of work related events such as 'routine employment related actions' and 'labour relations issues'. WCAT did not err in failing to give weight to the opinion of the respondent's treating psychologist in the absence of evidence to the contrary to rebut that opinion. The third requirement is an objective assessment of the nature of the workplace events and stressors from an objective point of view. This is consistent with the scheme and purpose of the GECA and furthers its overall intent to provide no fault compensation for injuries resulting from workplace accidents. The question of whether the policy is more restrictive than the general law that applies to GECA is reviewed according to the reasonableness standard. The Court found that WCAT erred in finding that there were 'unusual or excessive' stressors in the workplace which could ground a claim for gradual onset stress. It found that they were not. The Appeal Commissioner's reasoning process was unreasonable in that, having found there were unusual or excessive stressors, there was no causal link between those stressors and his stress injury.","Held: Appeal dismissed per reasons for judgment of Cromwell, J.A.; [1] This appeal turns on one main question: in deciding the worker’s gradual onset stress claim under the Government Employees Compensation Act, R.S.C. 1985, c.

(i) in finding that the worker\'s subjective reaction to external stressors in the workplace was not relevant to determining if he suffered a compensable accident under s. 4(1) of the GECA; For the reasons which follow, my view is that WCAT correctly applied the objective approach to determining whether there were workplace events or stressors sufficient to support a claim for gradual onset stress under GECA and that such an approach was the correct one, both under Policy 1.3.6 and under the general law applying to GECA claims in Nova Scotia.

c_1996canlii472.txt,"The plaintiff held a mortgage on a house destroyed by a suspicious fire. At the time of the fire there were two insurance policies in place for the purpose of indemnifying the plaintiff. One was placed by the mortgagors with the defendant to protect both their interests and those of the plaintiff. When the defendant notified the plaintiff that it was going to cancel the policy, the plaintiff placed a second policy on the property. The fire occurred less than a day before the first policy was to be cancelled. The defendant refused to honour the policy. It claimed that the formal Proof of Loss filed by the plaintiff was fraudulent, as it failed to disclose the existence of the second policy. Finding for the plaintiff, that the defendant has not satisfied the heavy burden of producing clear and satisfactory evidence that the plaintiff, through its employees, acted wilfully and knowingly to claim the benefit of coverage to which it was not entitled.","This was an action involving a contest between two insurance companies. In advancing their claim against one insured, Canada Trustco failed to disclose the existence of the second policy. Under the terms of the arrangement between the insurance companies, coverage was put in place on the basis of notice from the mortgage company. The insured property was totally destroyed by fire some 22 hours before the deadline. The mortgage was in both names and the insured insured did not know of the fire loss. The insurance policy was placed with the Co-operators General Insurance Company and protected both the insured's interests and the interests of the Mortgagee. The insurer of the insured property, which was owned by the insured, had advised the insured of the cancellation of the policy and had advised her of the possibility of foreclosure and that other insurance had been placed in place. When the insured applied to foreclose, the insurance company refused to cover the insured and the insurer refused to pay the insured. In this action, the insured claimed that the insurance policy had been cancelled and that the insured had been negligent in failing to notify the insurer of all the risks which came to their knowledge, specifically, the fact that the mortgage payments were in arrears and the financial and other difficulties of the Browns, that she was desperately attempting to sell this property, and that she had been threatened with foreclosure"" (Beckett letter, Feb. 24, 1993, TAB 49). The insured, who had been the insured for the mortgage at the time of the loss, claimed that there had been an overlap to the extent of one day of coverage that being the date of loss. HELD: The claim was dismissed.  1)The insured insured was not affected by any misrepresentation on the part of the mortgaged person. The reasonable expectation of the mortgagee was that the clause would have the same effect as a separate policy insuring the insured interest as the policy. 2)The insurance company was not obliged to provide coverage to the insured on the first day of the claim. 3)The insurer was not under any obligation to tell the insured that the coverage would take effect immediately.","In reviewing the history of the standard mortgage clause, La Forest, J. makes it clear that such clause is not to be equated with what might be called loss payee provision and, thus, it creates ""a direct contract"" between the Mortgagees and the insurance company as would enable the former to sue in their own name alone and irrespective of the mortgagor. I am not satisfied that the Defendant has established on a balance of probability that there was any material misrepresentation with respect to the extent of the risk, nor any fraudulent behaviour with respect to the completion of the Proof of Loss. With respect to the latter, there is a heavy onus on the party making the allegation. In view of those words appearing in the subscription policy and in view of the context in which the claim was put forward, the Defendant has not satisfied that heavy burden of producing clear and satisfactory evidence that Canada Trustco, through its employees, acted wilfully and knowingly to claim the benefit of coverage to which the corporation was not entitled.

The defendant's evidence was that he had only entered his vehicle to listen to music while he decided whether to walk to a nearby party or his girlfriend's house. Defendant found not guilty of either offence charged. From the defendant's whole course of conduct, which included driving the vehicle to the pub before consuming any alcohol, walking to his friend's house and back again to the pub, as well as his stated intention to leave the vehicle where it was, the court concluded that he had rebutted the presumption under s. 258(1(a). Given that the defendant's vehicle was parked on a level parking lot with its nose two feet or less from a building, the parking brake was engaged, the vehicle was in first gear and the engine was not running, the court concluded that there was little, if any, danger of the vehicle being set in motion unintentionally or of it becoming a danger to the public.","The accused was charged with care and control of a motor vehicle contrary to s. 253(a) of the Criminal Code; and having consumed alcohol in such a quantity that the concentration of his blood exceeded eighty milligrams in one hundred milliliters of blood.

4_2006skca76.txt,"The appeal is from an order granting interim custody of a 10 year old girl to her father, notwithstanding that the child had been in the custody of the mother since the mother and father separated about 4 years ago. During the separation the father paid some maintenance for the child pursuant to an agreement made by the parties themselves, and had extensive access to the child, she spending at least one weekend a month with him, as well as the summer holiday. HELD: Appeal allowed orally.  1) The oral reasons of the Family Court judge granting interim custody to the father were not available to the court, so it had no reasons for the decision available to assist it in the review of the decision. 2) The appeal must succeed. Even assuming the Investigation Record was admissible into evidence by reason of the agreement of the parties, and that the psychologist's report was admissible into evidence under s. 97 of The Queen's Bench Act, both of which propositions are at least arguable, there is no evidence other than unsworn hearsay evidence upon which it could be found that the mother was alcoholic and that the child suffered from it, while there is sworn evidence from the mother denying that to be so, as well as sworn evidence from three other persons supporting the mother's evidence to at least some degree. The father's affidavits are the only sworn evidence filed in support of his case. It is apparent that the father had no personal knowledge of the mother's drinking habits during the past four years, nor any personal knowledge of how the mother cared for the children. 3) It is apparent that none of the authors of the documents supporting the father's position that the mother is an alcoholic and is not properly caring for the child (the Investigation Record and The Drug and Alcohol Assessment Report) had any personal knowledge that that is the case. The information conveyed is nothing more than the opinion of the authors based on hearsay, namely information obtained by third parties, the only one identified is Ms. Tindall. One is left wondering why no one sought to obtain an affidavit from her. 4) Hearsay matters in the father's affidavits should not have been considered. The report were not sworn or verified under oath.  Thus Rule 603(3) does not apply to them, and to the extent that they were based on hearsay, they should not have been considered. Without the hearsay evidence, there was no case for even the direction of a trial of the issue, let alone an order in favour of the father.","The court allowed the appeal from an order granting interim custody of a 10 year old girl to her father, notwithstanding that the child had been in the custody of the mother since the mother and father separated about 4 years ago. During the separation, the father paid some maintenance for the child and had extensive access to the child, she spending most of the time with her maternal grandparents. The mother filed an affidavit denying all of the allegations and in particular, that she was an alcoholic and that her alcoholism adversely affected the child. HELD: The appeal was allowed.

e_2000canlii19619.txt,"Accused charged with impaired driving, being over.08 and driving while disqualified. The charges arose out of an incident where he rear-ended car stopped in front of him at red light. The accident victim estimated the time of the accident to be around 1:30 a.m. After the accident, the victim, witnesses and attending police officers noticed that the accused displayed signs of intoxication. The police arrived at the scene at 2:12 a.m. The accused was seated in the police car and was first spoken to shortly before 3:00 a.m. The officer determined through CPIC that the accused was prohibited from driving in Saskatchewan. The demand for breath sample was made at 2:48 a.m. At 2:50 a.m. he was given his rights and he spoke to lawyer prior to providing sample. HELD: The evidence of the crown witnesses was accepted over that of the defendant. The Court found beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant was the operator of the vehicle when the collision occurred and therefore the accused was found guilty of driving while disqualified. The crown was not able to prove beyond a reasonable doubt the time of the accident and, therefore, is not entitled to rely upon the presumption provided in s.258(1) of the Code. The Court was not able to conclude that the first sample was taken within 2 hours of the incident. On the charge of impaired driving, the Court had no doubt that the accused's ability to operate a motor vehicle was impaired by alcohol. The Court also held that there was no breach of fundamental justice by virtue of the discussion of the police witnesses with the civilian witnesses during the trial. When witness remains in the courtroom after an exclusion order and then testifies, the trial judge may consider this in deciding the weight to be given to the evidence of that witness. This principle is equally applicable to the case at hand where witnesses who had yet to testify discussed the evidence with other witnesses after their testimony. The Court rejected the defence argument that there was an appearance of unfairness about the trial process that requires that a stay of proceedings to be entered. The Court held that there must be manifest unfairness in the trial process as a result of the impugned behaviour in order to find a breach of fundamental justice. Here the impugned conduct only affects the weight to be given to the evidence of the police officers. The conversation complained of took place outside of the courtroom at trial and was not material to the outcome of the trial or the charges. There was no tailoring of the evidence as consequence of the discussion. Even if the Court had found breach of fundamental justice, stay would not be appropriate. After the conversation was discovered, it was reported to the Court and the trial was adjourned to permit full disclosure of the impugned conversation and to give counsel an opportunity to prepare in light of the development. stay is to be entered only in the clearest of cases. Here the right of the defendant to a fair trial has not been prejudiced by the introduction of evidence as the Court was able to assess the weight to be given to the officers' evidence.

HELD: The accused was found not guilty of count 3 in the Information. 1)The Crown had proven beyond a reasonable doubt that the accused was the operator of the vehicle when the accident occurred and at all material times. The impugned conduct affects only the weight to be given to the evidence of the witnesses notwithstanding the conduct complained of. The right of the accused to a fair trial has not been prejudiced by the introduction of this evidence in these circumstances. 2)The conversation complained of was not material to the outcome of the trial or the charges before it. There was no bad intent on the part of the officers nor did they find tailoring of the evidence as consequence of the discussion. The accused's testimony was most apparent to me because of his insistence that there were only two people in the cab of the truck who he said was driving. The driver of the Sunfire was unsteady on his feet and leaned on vehicle to support himself. He had alcohol on his breath and his eyes were bloodshot. The cab driver's testimony that he saw the accused get out of his truck and fall asleep enroute to his destination was questionable. The police were operating under very tight time lines in order to meet the requirements permitting reliance on the presumption. 3)The Court was unable to conclude that the first sample was obtained within two hours of the accident. The Court found that there must be a manifest unfairness in the trial process as a result of the impugning behavior in order for the Crown to find that there has been a breach of fundamental justice. In these circumstances, the accused's driving was impaired by alcohol having regard to the test in R. v. Stellato. In any event, the Court found the accused guilty of counts 3 and 3.","CHARGES [1] Thomas Alexander Spark is charged with 3 counts in relation to one incident occurring March 20, 1999 at Saskatoon, Saskatchewan: impaired driving contrary to sections 255(1) and 253(a), over .08 contrary to sections 253(b) and 255(1) and driving while disqualified contrary so section 259(4), all of the Criminal Code of Canada.

No. There has not been a breach of fundamental justice.

I’m of the view that there must be a manifest unfairness in the trial process as a result of the impugned behavior in order for me to find that there has been a breach of fundamental justice.

The crown was not able to prove beyond a reasonable doubt the time of the accident and, therefore, is not entitled to rely upon the presumption provided in s.258(1) of the Code. The Court was not able to conclude that the first sample was taken within 2 hours of the incident. On the charge of impaired driving, the Court had no doubt that the accused's ability to operate a motor vehicle was impaired by alcohol. The Court also held that there was no breach of fundamental justice by virtue of the discussion of the police witnesses with the civilian witnesses during the trial. When witness remains in the courtroom after an exclusion order and then testifies, the trial judge may consider this in deciding the weight to be given to the evidence of that witness. This principle is equally applicable to the case at hand where witnesses who had yet to testify discussed the evidence with other witnesses after their testimony. The Court rejected the defence argument that there was an appearance of unfairness about the trial process that requires that a stay of proceedings to be entered. The Court held that there must be manifest unfairness in the trial process as a result of the impugned behaviour in order to find a breach of fundamental justice.

He contended the information was nullity because it contravened s. 789(2) of the Criminal Code. The Provincial Court trial judge severed the count which was the source of the difficulty. The appellant sought an order from the Court of Queen's Bench quashing the trial proceedings. That application was dismissed and the appellant appealed to this Court. HELD: The appeal was dismissed. In dealing with count 4, the trial judge learned only of the Crown's allegation that the appellant had driven while disqualified pursuant to ss. 253 and 254 of the Code. He also held that he would not be improper for the judge to preside over the trial on the impaired driving, refusal and obstruction charges. The trial judge in this case did not grant the application to sever the count as being nullity. It was remitted back to trial judge. 1) The Court of Appeal did not give the appellant's reason for not responding sooner to the severing of the count. It is inevitable that the judicial record will play a role in the decision making process. However, no reasonable apprehension of bias arose by virtue of this trial judge's decision. 2) There is no normalcy of bias in the criminal justice system as a result of the convictions of mere mortals. It does not rise to the level of a normal judicial process. 3) The test for apprehension of biases in criminal law is well settled. The leading case is R. v. S.(R.D.), 1997 CanLII 324 (SCC), [1997] S.C.R. 484, 151 D.L.R.(4th) 193. A trial judge sitting in the Supreme Court of Canada will automatically grant a severance of the information if the reason for the severance is a different one than that given to the appellant. The decision of the Provincial Court judge was not automatically automatic.","Disposition: Dismissed (Orally) [1] The appellant, Taryn Rathgeber, was charged on a four count information in connection with an alleged impaired driving incident. Rather, he contended that, after recognizing a problem in relation to s. 789(2) of the Code and severing count 4 of the information, the trial judge should have dealt only with that count. More specifically, Mr. Rathgeber contended that an apprehension of bias arose when the judge elected to proceed on the first three counts, i.e. the charges concerning impaired driving, refusing a breath demand and obstruction. No reasonable apprehension of bias arose by virtue of the trial judge’s decision to proceed in relation to the first three counts in the information.

The respondent had not shown a material change required to vary the obligation nor had he met the onus to justify the need for a change to the amount of child support payable for the years 2005 to 2012. From January 2016, the respondent was ordered to pay child support for one child based upon his current income ; and 2) the respondent had not provided any meaningful financial support for his children for the entire period despite the fact that enforcement steps had been taken by the Maintenance Enforcement Office. The court determined that the respondent had the ability to pay the arrears and it would not expunge them. The arrears from 2013 to date would be adjusted to accord with the respondent’s current income.","The respondent applies for an order to discontinue his obligation to pay child support and spousal support and for all support arrears to be expunged. He relies upon s. 17 of the Divorce Act, RSC 1985, and s. 14 of the Federal Child Support Guidelines. HELD: 1) The original order was correct. The matter did not proceed beyond the interim stage. Rather, from April 2005 through to the present, the respondent has been content to have the existing order in place and did not seek to challenge it by way of trial proceedings to obtain a final order different from that pronounced by McIntyre J. 2) The respondent is able to establish he has been working full-time employment for the past four years. In those years, he earned actual income from full time position. There is little doubt it will be onerous for him but then, on the other hand, he has avoided paying anything for considerable period of time. In the result, am not prepared to expunge any of the arreears prior to 2013. 3) The Court must consider whether the original Order was correct at the time it was made. The present income is $88,808.88 per annum. This is a consistent income for several years. The respondent elected not to challenge the imputation of income made 10 years ago. It is not complete answer to the determination of an appropriate historical income for the respondent. The obligation does not lie on the petitioner to show why the imputed income is still appropriate. The onus rests squarely on the respondent to justify the need for change. He must present evidence of changed circumstances which establish that either a) it is no longer necessary or appropriate to impute income, (i.e. that he is unable to continue with the manufacture of the invention, and (ii) he is unlikely to be able to continue to earn consistent income in the future. While there is nothing to explain what has changed, the onus lies with the respondent, who is prepared to pay his proportionate share of post-secondary education costs. It appears he was not able to find employment in his chosen field, because he was working, and because he had avoided providing any meaningful financial support to his children and former spouse for the entire time the order has been in place.","[1] The respondent applies for an order to discontinue his obligation to pay both child support and spousal support and further for all support arrears to be expunged. 5.

7_2010nssc146.txt,"The accused, who faced three counts of trafficking and possession for the purposes of trafficking, had negotiated agreements with the Crown that preserved her right to re-elect from a trial by judge and jury to a trial by judge alone and provided that she would not contest the admissibility of a video statement she had given to the police and, if a motion to dismiss at the conclusion of the Crown's case was unsuccessful, she would testify in her own defence. Following a voir dire and one-and-a-half days of trial, new evidence (which could be used to impeach the accused's credibility and contradict things she had told the police in the video statement) came to the Crown's attention. The accused argued that the admission of this new evidence would adversely affect her approach to the trial as important tactical decisions had been made on the strength of the Crown's previous disclosure. Mistrial declared; the accused is released from the undertakings and agreements made to date and has the right to re-elect her mode of trial. The late disclosure breached the accused's ability to make full answer and defence owing to the decisions she had already made regarding her defence and trial strategy and prejudiced her in a number of ways, which prejudice could not be cured by an adjournment or other order at this late stage. However, to proceed with the trial without the new evidence would be unfair to the Crown and compromise the court's 'truth seeking' function.","The accused brought an application for relief under s.24(1) of the Charter alleging that the Crown's intention to adduce the newly discovered evidence has adversely affected her s. and 11(d) Charter rights.

To that end, through her counsel, she negotiated a number of matters with the Crown. At the conclusion of the trial, defence counsel notified defence counsel of the new evidence and disclosure was provided to defence counsel within twenty-four hours of the Crown learning of it. The Crown argued strenuously that the information which it has now recently disclosed was already in the possession of the accused because she participated in the discussions with Corporal Vail. HELD: A mistrial was ordered. 1)The accused gave up her right to contest the admissibility of the video taped evidence and her right not to call defence evidence and to remain silent. 2)The Court was satisfied that the accused had not been prejudiced by the disclosure of evidence. 3)The trial was fair from the perspective of the public and society more broadly. The trial would be fair from a point of view of fairness and balance of probabilities. 4)There was no dispute between the parties on the general obligations of disclosure imposed on the Crown beginning with the Supreme Court's decision in Stinchcombe, [1991] S.C.R. 326, which has been followed and elaborated on ever since it was decided in 1991. The court is always reluctant to order a mistrial except in the clearest of cases and when the impugned conduct undermines trial fairness or the decision making process.

A letter of credit binding the financial institution to advance the money in any event would be beyond the means of most farmers who had recently experienced difficult financial circumstances. To interpret the letter of committment referred to in the Act in a manner that would exclude mortgage financing would eliminate the ability of most farmers to exercise the right of first refusal.

The children's investment in Canada Savings Bonds and Mutual Funds exist in the childrens' names in the approximate amount of $2,000 each. They are happy and content to be with their father. The day to day physical custody, and decision making during this period are their greatest concerns. To date, it has not been the 'occasional resort' to the Court referred to in Krugger v. Krugger (1980), 11 R.F.L. (2d) 52. It is impossible to determine the source or the reason why the symptoms or responses of the children are occurring. It could be any single or combination of factors that have occurred since June 30, 1993.",0.06741573033707865

Neither the deceased's Will nor the codicil made in November and December 1989 respectively made provision for the second son born December 1989, subsequent to the separation of the parties. The elder son was the sole beneficiary and the farmlands were to be held in trust for him until he turned twenty-one. The younger son was diabetic and had extraordinary medical expenses. The eldest required braces. The mother's income was $1,089 per month. The deceased had been paying support in the amount of $150 per month per child pursuant to the 1991 divorce order. The mother sought an order under s17(4) of the Divorce Act varying child maintenance from $300 to $1,245 per month for the two children. The Executors did not oppose the application but put in issue the Estate's ability to support that level of maintenance. HELD: The younger child was entitled to share equally with his brother in the estate as a reasonable provision had not been made for his maintenance. Maintenance was varied to $900 per month for the two children.  1)Different considerations arise in the context of a Dependants' Relief Act application taken in conjunction with a variation application. The phrase 'reasonable provision' in s9(1) of the Dependants' Relief Act is to be no longer defined as that which would permit the dependent to maintain the standard of living enjoyed during the lifetime of the testator but is to be determined having regard to the testator's legal and moral obligations to the dependent and others (Ostrander).

The amount of maintenance is not, of necessity, tied to the standard of living experienced when the testator was alive or to the net income the Estate will generate subsequently. The court departed from the Guidelines for the reason the award was made in conjunction with a Dependent's Relief application, the income of the estate was currently unknown, but the court was satisfied that reasonable provision has been made for the children. 3)There was nothing in the Will, read as a whole with reference to the ordinary rules of construction which required the term personal effects to be given anything other than their ordinary meaning; with the clarification that the testator did not wish to preserve personal use vehicles.

8_1997canlii11328.txt,"The two accused, both Metis, were separately charged in 1993 with six fishing offences relating to the use of nets. The accused who had ten nets on two lakes at the time of seizure admitted to being commercial fisherman. The Crown had stated to the defence that fishing for commercial purposes would not be an issue. The trial judge dismissed the defence motion for a direction that the Crown comply with his undertaking that the issue was whether the Metis of Northwestern Saskatchewan have an aboriginal right to fish for food. The Provincial Court Judge found both accused not guilty on three of the counts on the basis of standard criminal law defences but would have convicted on the other three charges but for the constitutional defence. The Crown appealed the acquittals based on the constitutional defence. Grounds for appeal included failure to distinguish between an Aboriginal right to fish for food and for commercial purposes; failure to find the accused were engaged in commercial fishing and that neither the accused nor their ancestors possessed an Aboriginal right to fish for commercial purposes; by concluding that scrip issued to Metis pursuant to s6(f) of the Dominion Lands Act and Order-Council did not extinguish any Aboriginal right to fish for food or commercial purposes; the trial judge erred by failing to conclude that the requirement to obtain a licence before fishing with a net was not a prima facie infringement of an existing aboriginal right to fish for food; in acquitting the accused when neither the Aboriginal rights defence nor equality rights defence had any application to the charge. The Saskatchewan Metis Nation and National Council were granted Intervenor status. HELD: 1)The first three grounds were dismissed. The trial judge found that the Crown had not breached an undertaking, nor misrepresented its position with respect to the constitutional issue but implicitly found that the respondents had been prejudiced through the misunderstanding during pre-trial communications between council as to the issues that would be argued during trial. The trial judge was entitled to find as fact that it was not the intention of the parties to confine the issue to commercial fishing. 2)Once it was determined the actual activity was fishing for the purpose of selling the fish, the only rights that could be said to be infringed were either the right to exchange fish for money or goods or the right to fish commercially (Gladstone). The aboriginal right to fish for food was no longer relevant because the evidence did not establish that as the activity they were engaged in. 3)The trial judge's finding that an Aboriginal right to fish existed in Metis persons of northwest Saskatchewan separate and apart from the issue of aboriginal title was one he was entitled to make and should not be disturbed. The case law makes it perfectly clear that aboriginal rights are site specific and the finding of a right in one group in one location does not establish the same right for another group in another location (Van der Peet). 4)There is no basis to distinguish between Indian and Metis people when considering whether a licensing requirement constitutes an infringement of the aboriginal right to fish for food. 5)The departmental policy which placed a higher priority on treaty Indian fishing than domestic licence food fishing for Metis persons constituted an infringement. Once an infringement is found the onus shifts to the Crown to demonstrate that the regulation is justifiable.

The appeal Division found that the circumstances in which the respondent was found to be in did not meet the test set out in McFetridge v. Nova Scotia Barristers' Society (18.S.R. (2d) 319. The trial judge reversed the respondent's decision and ordered a new hearing. This was a very special case and the normal test in interim injunction cases is to find on a balance of convenience that it is necessary to obtain time for the court to adjudicate the issues arising from the special circumstances of the case and that the consequences of not staying in the lower proceedings would be serious and irreversible.","This is an application by Donald Frank Ripley for an interim injunction restraining the respondents from further proceedings against the applicant in respect of charges prosecuted against the applicant pursuant to the constitution, by‑laws and regulations of the Investment Dealers Association of Canada (I.D.A.). The application for the interim injunction is made pending the outcome of an application for certiorari quashing the decision of the disciplinary panel of the I.D.A. which application will be heard in the Supreme Court Trial Division on September 6, 1990. The application for certiorari is joined with an application for an order in the nature of prohibition restraining the I.D.A. from taking any further proceedings against Mr. Ripley. In January, 1988 the I.D.A. brought six charges of professional misconduct against Mr. Ripley, in his capacity as an investment dealer and member of the association. The Appeal Division found that the American Cyanamid test was not applicable and that the court should not interfere with the proceedings of a quasi judicial or other tribunal by interim injunction or stay except in very special circumstances. For these reasons, the application for an interim injunction is
dismissed, without costs.",0.32884097035040427,"This was an application by the respondent for an interim injunction restraining the respondents from further proceedings against the applicant in respect of charges prosecuted against him pursuant to the constitution, bylaws and regulations of the Investment Dealers Association of Canada (I.D.A.). The respondent had been advised to stay out of the investment business for an indefinite period of time until he recovered to cope with daily stresses of the business. The applicant argued that the American Cyanamid test was not applicable and the court should not interfere with the proceedings of a quasi judicial or other tribunal by way of an injunction. HELD: The application for interim injunction was granted without costs. 1)Although the hearing before the tribunal might result in the charges being either substantiated or rejected, the Court was unable to instruct his counsel and his counsel stated at the hearing that if the injunction was not granted, no submissions would be made by the applicant to the disciplinary panel with respect to penalties. 2)The applicant would have satisfied the requirements of the interim injunction except in very special circumstances, e.g. where there was a denial of natural justice illustrated by several examples of unfair procedures and unfair procedures.",0.27699530516431925

When the police approached a group of youth standing around vehicles, through one of the vehicle's open windows they noticed two open bottles of beer. While searching the vehicle for liquor, they moved a knapsack on the floor to check under the seat; the knapsack felt heavy and it felt like there were bottles inside it. The police opened the knapsack and found beer bottles, narcotics and a large amount of cash. In the front pocket of the knapsack, the police found the defendant's wallet with identification and personal papers. They also found packages of cocaine in the console of the vehicle. The defendant, who was not the owner of the vehicle, was not present when the search was conducted. The owner of the vehicle testified that he had picked up the defendant in his vehicle earlier in the day and that the defendant had placed the knapsack in the vehicle. When the police arrived, they both got out of the vehicle and the defendant left. The defence argued that the evidence was all circumstantial. The defendant was found guilty on all charges. The evidence established that the defendant had handed the packages of cocaine found in the console of the vehicle to the vehicle's owner; thus the cocaine was in the defendant's personal possession initially and thereafter in the defendant's and his friend's joint possession. The knapsack was in the personal possession of the defendant when he entered the vehicle and no one else had access to it until the police seized it; the only reasonable inference to be drawn was not only that the knapsack was in the personal possession of the defendant but that since it contained items of such a personal nature and since the cocaine handed to the friend had come from the knapsack and no one else has access to it, the defendant must have had knowledge of all its contents and consented to them being there. The three rolls of cash were also in the possession of the defendant and since they were in such small denominations and were found in the same bag as the large amounts of cocaine and marijuana, rolled in the manner in which drug dealers commonly hold their cash, and as the defendant was a student the previous year and therefore unlikely to have large amounts of cash from any other source, the only reasonable inference was that the rolls of cash were the proceeds of drug trafficking.","The accused was charged with possession of marijuana for the purpose of trafficking, cocaine for the purposes of trafficking and possession of property obtained by crime under s. 355(b) of the Criminal Code. HELD: The evidence seized was admissible against the accused. The Crown had relied on circumstantial evidence but had not proven beyond a reasonable doubt that the items seized by the police in this case were possessed for sale, not personal use. It was obvious that he had control of the bag and contents until he left the motor vehicle.","[1] Shea Patrick William Ernst is charged with possession of cannabis marijuana for the purpose of trafficking, with possession of cocaine for the purpose of trafficking, both under s. 5(2) of the Controlled Drugs and Substances Act and with possession of property obtained by crime under s. 355(b) of the Criminal Code.

Application granted; the oldest child to be placed in the supervised care of her paternal grandmother and the biological father is not to live in that home; both parents can have supervised carefully monitored access to that child (if access is not exercised by either party, that access will be terminated); the three youngest children are to be placed in the permanent care of the Agency for the purposes of adoption with both parents' access to these children to be weaned.

HELD: Spousal Support was to end in August 2008 for the wife. 1) The applicant's income was primarily derived from his pension. The fact that the wife was presently unemployed and had explained why she could not work made it more difficult for him to pay her. He was entitled to a lump sum payment in the amount of $843,000 that was to be paid to her. Her unchanged circumstances were juxtaposed against the applicant's decrease in income and his responsibility to meet the needs of their son. 2) The court was sympathetic to the husband's need for support and to the application's need to see an end to this obligation.

He sought a termination of spousal support or a decrease in support with a fixed date for termination. She suffered from serious mental illness and had been unable to work. The applicant received a severance package and pension was to start in September 2005. He received an order for maintenance of $300 per month for five years, payable until August 2008. Because of the wife's disability, the length of time needed to be at the higher end. The application was heard in June 2005. It is not unusual for such orders to be indefinite at the outset. This is an application to vary after 9 years of continuous support. The court found that there has been a change in circumstances as required by the Divorce Act before variation can be considered. HELD: Spousal Support was to end in August 2008 for the wife. 1) The applicant's income was primarily derived from his pension. The fact that the wife was presently unemployed and had explained why she could not work made it more difficult for him to pay her. He was entitled to a lump sum payment in the amount of $843,000 that was to be paid to her. Her unchanged circumstances were juxtaposed against the applicant's decrease in income and his responsibility to meet the needs of their son. 2) The court was sympathetic to the husband's need for support and to the application's need to see an end to this obligation. Although he had some employment since retirement, there were not any hidden costs and the increased costs would continue and no doubt increase as the son pursues his education.","[1] This is Mr. Puddifant’s application to vary a corollary relief judgment issued August 20, 1998, varied the 20th of August, 2001, amended July 2, 2002 and varied in June 2003. In his amended application dated June 23, 2005, he seeks a termination of spousal support or alternatively a decrease in support with a fixed date for termination. 4. The Respondent shall pay to the Petitioner for the support and maintenance of the Petitioner the sum of $600.00 per month which shall be payable in bi-monthly instalments of $300.00 each, the first such payment to be made on July 15, 1998, the second such payment to be made on the last day of July, 1998, and likewise on the 15th and last day of each succeeding month, PROVIDED HOWEVER that in the event the Respondent should elect to apply for and obtain that portion of the Petitioner’s monthly Canada Pension Plan payment in non-taxable benefit payable with respect to the child, then in such an event, the Respondent shall pay to the Petitioner for the support and maintenance of the Petitioner the sum of $800.00 per month, payable in bi-monthly payments of $400.00 each, on the 15th and the last day of each month. [19] Here the respondent has converted her equalized property into income. [22] I conclude that the maintenance ought to be reduced to $300.00 per month effective September 1, 2005 to take into account his reduced income and her income derived from the pension division. This is an application to vary after nine years of continuous support. [38] Notwithstanding the wife’s disability, I cannot conclude that his obligation to her should extend beyond the length of their marriage.

They alleged officials and Indian agents were negligent in carrying out their duties to inform the plaintiffs of their right to receive full and complete benefits and in some case agents misappropriated benefits. HELD: The application was dismissed. A class action is not the preferable procedure in the circumstances. The issue of discoverability relating to each plaintiff overwhelms any common issues.

Such a class action would be completely unmanageable and certification would result in a multitude of individual trials, which would completely override any advantage that might be derived from a trial of a few potential common issues.

d_2005skca149.txt,"The respondent had just begun serving the community supervision portion of a custody and supervision order made pursuant to the Youth Criminal Justice Act when he walked away from his designated residence and breached the terms of the order. The provincial director immediately issued a warrant for his apprehension but he was not found until almost a month later. His case went to the Youth Court for review under s. 103 of the Act. The Youth Court judge interpreted the Act as meaning the respondent's sentence had continued to run while he was at large and had expired. She held that no action was required on the alleged breach of the custody and supervision order. The Crown appeals the decision. HELD: Appeal allowed. 1) The Youth Court judge erred in her interpretation of the Act. On a proper reading of the Act, the respondent was deemed not to be serving his sentence during the time period between when the warrant was issued and when he was apprehended. 2) A straightforward analysis of the Act serves to answer the question of whether the respondent's sentence continued to run while he was at large. Section 102(1) of the Act sets out the authority of the director, when a young person has breached or is about to breach a condition of his community supervision. The director may, pursuant to s. 102(1)(a), permit the young person to continue to serve his sentence in the community or, pursuant to s. 102(1)(b) of the Act, if the breach is serious and increases the risk to public safety, the director may order the young person to be remanded in custody until a review is conducted. Section 102(2) goes on to make s. 107 and s. 108 applicable to an order for remand and review made pursuant to s. 102(1)(b). Section 107(1) is the provision referred to by s. 102(2) that is of concern. There is an obvious modification of s. 107(1) which 'the circumstances require' when it applies in the context of a breach of the conditions of community supervision.

e_1984canlii199.txt,"The Plaintiff contracted to provide market survey to the Defendant. Before its completion, the contract was replaced by second contract for Fund Development Officer. Each party had a different understanding of the duties of the Fund Development Officer which misunderstanding the Judge classified as a mutual mistake. The failure of performance by plaintiff entitled defendant to repudiate the contract. Defendant's counterclaim for rescission of first agreement, and repayment of monies paid under second agreement, failed where it accepted plaintiff's performance and paid consideration therefore.","This action was brought by Fossil Fuel Development Ltd. against Tudex Petroleums Ltd. (Tudex) for breach of contract claiming damages. The principal officer of Fossil incorporated it for the purpose of becoming involved with Tudex. The three principal officers of Tudex heard evidence from Lovell, Crooks and Molle. The third principal officer was not called. The claim for $31,500 was rejected on the same ground that rescission of the agreement relating to the market study was disallowed. In its counterclaim, Fossil alleges that Tudex is seeking to contradict or vary the terms of the contract outlined in the letter of June 2, 1981. That is not so. There is no ambiguity. Lovell was hired as a fund development officer. The question is what was intended by that designation. In the counterclaim Tudex seeks rescission, not only of the contracts of June 1981 but also of the agreements relating to a market study and the agreement regarding the market.

The respondent has instructed the petitioner to forward the following without prejudice proposal in order to attempt settlement of the parties parenting and child support matters. Just as promised, the letter goes on to set out a detailed, comprehensive offer of settlement. HELD: 1) Settlement privilege aside, and with the exception of few issues such as costs and limitation periods or when a party seeks to establish a concluded agreement, am hard pressed to come up with a situation where the existence of a settlement proposal would be relevant to an issue before the Court. The law is clear that settlement proposals should seldom be made known to the Court, it happens too often and for no good reason. It is common sense that settlement is less likely if the parties do not engage in full and frank discussions at all if such could be used to their detriment. The privilege is clearly an important one and in cases of doubt as to whether the correspondence does relate to the negotiations, the Court should undoubtedly err on the side of protecting the privilege. 2) The respondent exhibited a letter to his counsel that was from his counsel to the petitioner's counsel. The letter was marked 'Without Prejudice' and began with: 'My proposal is reasonable so must be good, reasonable parent; by failing to accept that reasonable proposal, she must be unreasonable and, therefore not as good parent.' This is gamesmanship and nothing more. Gamesmanship fouls that which the policy seeks to promote.","Settlement negotiations are protected by settlement privilege which is a jointly held privilege that cannot be waived by any one party acting alone. 2) The application at bar is another salvo in a bitter custody and access dispute.

Defendant sentenced to fine of $25,000, from which the sum of $15,000 shall be paid to the Canadian Farmers' Disability Registry; defendant ordered to perform 160 hours of community service with respect to farm safety. The defendant was an individual and not a huge corporation, had been conscientious about safety issues prior to this incident and had endeavored to improve safety at his farm after the incident; the deceased had also failed in his responsibilities under the Act and was working with a significant blood alcohol content.","The defendant pleaded guilty to an offence under the Occupational Health and Safety Act relating to the fact that there was a manure pit on the farm that did not have a barrier. The defendant's responsibility to safeguard employees from risks associated with that manure pit arose under s. 13(1) of the Act. The Act also requires that every employee, while at work, shall 'take every reasonable precaution in the circumstances to protect the employee's own health and safety at or near the workplace'. The defendant failed to secure the manure pit which had its damaged barricade removed while a new one was on order, or not arranging for an alternative to use the pit, alternatives that did exist at the time. He had been out all night at social event and had been drinking and had not slept. His blood alcohol concentration was significantly over the legal limit for operating any kind of vehicle. Nothing can bring Mr. Boake back to life but the experience of the tragedy and, very importantly, Mr. Sutherland's knowledge of addressing farm safety issues, can assist in preventing another life.","[1] Mark Sutherland owns and operates a family dairy farm. [2] Mr. Sutherland has pleaded guilty to an offence under the Occupational Health and Safety Act , that he failed to take every precaution that is reasonable in the circumstances to ensure the health and safety of persons at the workplace. Mr. Sutherland’s guilty plea relates to the fact that on August 13, 2006, there was a manure pit on the farm that did not have a barrier. He drowned in a manure pit. Mr. Sutherland ’s failure was in not securing the manure pit which had its damaged barricade removed while a new one was on order, or not arranging for an alternative to using the pit, alternatives that did exist on the farm at the time. Other factors that are relevant to the issue of proportionality in this case are the fact that Mr. Sutherland is before me as an individual not a large corporation and the fact that Mr. Boake also had responsibilities under the Occupational Health and Safety Act that he did not meet.

The only evidence of the value of the property at this stage is contained in paragraph 10 of the affidavit, sworn on June 10, 2008 in part as follows: That the land is in my opinion of $30,000 to $45,000 and no more. The Credit Union understands that it is listed at $70,000 but the Credit Union's position is that this is overvalued and would likely sell in the $30k to $ 45,000 range. This opinion is based on discussions with the real estate company, Royal LePage Community Realty of Maple Creek, who has knowledge of property being sold in the area. The draft bill of costs submitted by counsel contains numerous items which occurred prior to the granting of leave. There is no order from the court authorizing pre-leave costs nor any evidence as to why the court might consider pre- leave costs. The affidavit was not in compliance with Rule 318 and 319 of the Queen's Bench Rules of Court.","[1] The plaintiff seeks an order confirming the order nisi for judicial sale.

HELD: The motions are dismissed with no order as to costs.  1) One of defendants contends that 7 people alleged by the plaintiffs to be viable class members have already entered into a full and final settlement with the defendant. This defendant earlier sought to examine these individuals. The Justice of this action at that time did not allow the examination but instead made an order permitting the defendant to file affidavits on the issue. This is the source of the affidavit the plaintiff seeks cross-examination on. The order also allowed the plaintiffs to file reply affidavits, which they chose not to do. There is nothing in the original order that could be interpreted as saying that the plaintiffs could cross-examine on the affidavit. In the view of the Court, having chosen not to file reply affidavits pursuant to the original order, it is not reasonable for plaintiff's counsel to embark on a totally different approach several weeks after the deadline has passed. There is also some concern that the actual purpose of the proposed cross-examination would be more general and broad-ranging than a mere challenge to the defendant's assertion that the individuals at issue have already entered into full and final settlements with the defendant.  2) In its barest sense, plaintiffs' counsel requests that the defendant supply a plaintiff by way of sending pre-certification notices to its clients. The Court is aware of Lewis v. Shell, where an Ontario court ordered notice to potential class members. However, that case is not similar to this case.

The plaintiffs alleged that the defendants failed to provide basic water services at various Holguin resorts including the following: Playa Costa Verda; Club Covarrubias; Grand Playa Pesquero; and Hotel Sol Rio de Luna Mares.

d_2010skca52.txt,"The appellant contests an order for $600.00 monthly spousal support given by a Chambers judge on an application to review a previous order which granted the respondent $300.00 monthly spousal support for a period of 1 year. The parties were married for 24 years following a 2-year period of cohabitation. They have 2 adult children, one of which is largely supported by the appellant. Both parties have some health problems. Originally, the appellant was ordered to pay the respondent $300.00 in monthly spousal support for a period of 1 year. Given the appellant's health difficulties and the fact that he was nearing retirement, the trial judge noted that the respondent would do well to become self-sufficient as soon as possible. The Chambers judge who reviewed the original order found that, during the year period the respondent was collecting spousal support, she had not engaged in any gainful employment. She had sold her house and used the proceeds to spend over 4 months living in Hawaii and Jamaica. She obtained probationary employment just after filing a notice of motion but lost the job before the hearing commenced. HELD: The appeal is allowed, the orders of the Chambers judge for spousal support and costs against the appellant are set aside. The Chambers judge imputed an income of $14,289 to the respondent on the basis that she was capable of working 30 hours per week at minimum wage. He did not indicate why he did not find her capable of full time employment. The Chambers judge made an error in calculating the income of the appellant. He also discounted the expenses borne by the appellant in relation the maintenance of their adult child, who was a full-time student. It was incumbent on the respondent to establish that she was unable to become self-sufficient. The evidence did not begin to establish that and, in fact, clearly showed that she made little effort to do so within the year allocated by the trial judge.","This appeal from a spousal support order was allowed orally from the bench for the reasons set out. The parties had separated in 2003 after 24 years of marriage following two years of cohabitation. At the time of the judgment, the respondent was 60 years old and the appellant was 53. They had two adult children, born in 1984 and 1989. The respondent had taken a buyout of her pension and job in exchange for $35,000. She had been diagnosed with breast cancer in 2005 and had had surgery followed up by radiation. She also had shingles and an attack in the nature of stroke in March 2006. She was receiving social assistance in the sum of $14,000 annually. HELD: The appeal is allowed orally. 1) The evidence before Sandomirsky J established that during the year following the one year order of Ottenbreit J. the respondent had not engaged in any gainful employment at all. She sold her house and used the proceeds to spend over four months out of Canada, living in Hawaii part of the time and spending month-long vacation in Jamaica. She paid for her adult children to visit her. Finally, on April 14, 2009, she commenced employment at Westfair Foods in a probationary position. This was after the 1 year spousa maintenance order had expired and only few days prior to filing the application to review that order and to award to her substantial permanent spousousal Support. Prior to the hearing of her application, she lost this position and said in her affidavits, filed in support of the application, that she was “disabled and still receiving treatments”, that her was enrolled in legal assistant program, and that she had sought permanent full time employment since losing the Westfair foods position, but had been unable to receive any offers of employment. She filed no medical evidence to indicate that she could not work and did not, in fact, say she was unable to work. In fact, she indicated she was seeking a full time position. 2) The chambers judge imputed an income to the respondent of $13,289 based on the assumption she was capable of working 30 hours week at minimum wage. He found the respondent's income to be $38,964.37.

The parties were married for 24 years following a 2-year period of cohabitation. They have 2 adult children, one of which is largely supported by the appellant. Both parties have some health problems. Originally, the appellant was ordered to pay the respondent $300.00 in monthly spousal support for a period of 1 year. Given the appellant's health difficulties and the fact that he was nearing retirement, the trial judge noted that the respondent would do well to become self-sufficient as soon as possible. The Chambers judge who reviewed the original order found that, during the year period the respondent was collecting spousal support, she had not engaged in any gainful employment. She had sold her house and used the proceeds to spend over 4 months living in Hawaii and Jamaica. She obtained probationary employment just after filing a notice of motion but lost the job before the hearing commenced. HELD: The appeal is allowed, the orders of the Chambers judge for spousal support and costs against the appellant are set aside. The Chambers judge imputed an income of $14,289 to the respondent on the basis that she was capable of working 30 hours per week at minimum wage. He did not indicate why he did not find her capable of full time employment. The Chambers judge made an error in calculating the income of the appellant. He also discounted the expenses borne by the appellant in relation the maintenance of their adult child, who was a full-time student. It was incumbent on the respondent to establish that she was unable to become self-sufficient. The evidence did not begin to establish that and, in fact, clearly showed that she made little effort to do so within the year allocated by the trial judge.","This appeal from a spousal support order was allowed orally from the bench for the reasons set out. It was clear that Ottenbreit J. set an order for fixed and short term in order to give the respondent an opportunity to find appropriate employment and become self sufficient. The fact that the respondent had had and still carries the burden of primarily maintaining Catherine was also a factor which militated against retroactive support. The order was based solely on calculation of the parties' respective incomes, as found or imputed. The chambers judge discounted the relevance of the expenses of maintaining Catherine on the basis she was over 18, without determining whether she was still a child of the marriage as a full time student.","Disposition: Appeal allowed Smith J.A.

At the end of trial, the applicant requested the Court to reserve on the matter of costs. The applicant intended to make a submission for award of solicitor and clients costs.

The applicant argues that solicitor and client costs of $70,000 should be awarded because the offer to settle of $250,000 is close to the total judgment award of $230,000 including party and party costs of $20,000.

The further evidence now showed that substantial offers were made through counsel although that evidence was not before the Court at trial. HELD: The application for a fixed award of costs was taken out. The court's discretion to award costs arises out of its inherent equitable jurisdiction and out of Rule 542 of The Queen's Bench Rules in assessing appropriate costs. Rule 343A contemplates amendment of judgment in these circumstances. There is a substantial monetary difference between the party and party costs awarded in the judgment and the solicitor and clients costs claimed by the applicant.

Evidence was led at trial about insubstantial offers made directly between the parties. The further evidence now shows that substantial offers were made through counsel, although that evidence was not before the Court at trial. The applicant argued that the Court needed to know the full extent of the estate so as to properly determine the applicant’s entitlement to the estate. HELD: 1)The applicant was awarded costs in lump sum. The respondent was ordered to pay the applicant post-judgment interest at a rate of five percent per annum from the date of the award until judgment is satisfied.  2)The Executions Act states that interest runs “from the time of entering judgment” and not from when the offer was made. The Court was faced with two equally untenable positions in determining costs. If the costs of the litigation were to be paid from the award date, the remainder may be insufficient to meet the application by the applicant. A settlement offered in September 1996 would have been equivalent to approximately $230,000 but, following the pre-trial conference, the respondent offered settlement at $156,000 which would be roughly equivalent to 1/2 of that amount. In the alternative, the applicant sought solicitor & client costs to be Paid from September 1996, which would result in a reduction in approximately $5,000 in fees and disbursements.  3)In fixing an amount, the Court is faced with the dilemma of whether costs should be fixed at $20,000 or reduced to a lump sum, depending on the circumstances. It was concluded that the respondent was not prepared to pay costs until the judgment was satisfied. 4)Solicitor and Client Costs are within the discretion of the Court and the re-hearing of this issue does not involve the merits of the case and was limited to the issue of costs (although the respondent has been awaiting the outcome of this application in order to satisfy the judgment).","[1] The applicant applies for amendment of my judgment of March 19, 1999 insofar as it relates to costs. It is now clear that the applicant intended to make a submission for award of solicitor and client costs of approximately $70,000. [9] The respondent argues that the position taken before Wimmer J. (who directed the issue to trial) was that the estate was willing to pay reasonable maintenance for Jade based on the needs-based approach, and that the quantum of maintenance could have been summarily determined without the necessity of extensive discoveries and without a lengthy trial. [22] In all of the circumstances, I order fixed costs to the applicant in the amount of $47,000, together with disbursements.",0.19685039370078736,"The applicant applies for amendment of the judgment dated March 19, 1999 as it relates to costs. At the end of trial, the applicant requested the Court to reserve on the matter of costs. The applicant intended to make a submission for award of solicitor and clients costs. Evidence was led at trial about insubstantial offers made directly between the parties. Further evidence now indicates that substantial offers were made through council although not led at trial. The applicant argues that solicitor and client costs of $70,000 should be awarded because the offer to settle of $250,000 is close to the total judgment award of $230,000 including party and party costs of $20,000. The respondent takes the position that the estate was willing to pay reasonable maintenance costs and the quantum of maintenance could have been summarily determined without the necessity of extensive discoveries and without a lengthy trial. The respondent submits the approach of a needs-based assessment was upheld by the judgment and is always the approach always taken on behalf of the estate. The respondent argues the real question is whether the parties were acting bona fide during their negotiations and the issue should not be determined on the basis of the closeness of the offers. HELD: Solicitor and Client Costs of $70,000 are not appropriate in this case. The applicant's conduct was not entirely pure. The applicant was made aware in a prior judgment that under The Dependants' Relief Act there is nothing to indicate that a person is entitled to part of an estate as a beneficiary but rather that a beneficiary is entitled to maintenance. In spite of this ruling the applicant continued to claim the whole of the estate and to pursue full disclosure of the financial worth of the estate. Solicitor and client costs are within the discretion of the court but such discretion is exercise only in rare and exceptional circumstances. The conduct of the respondent cannot be characterized as reprehensible, scandalous or outrageous. The respondent's unwillingness to make full financial disclosure did contribute to the increase of costs but is insufficient to merit full solicitor and client costs. The Court awards fixed costs to the applicant in the amount of $47,000 together with disbursements.","The applicant applies for amendment of the judgment insofar as it relates to costs. At the conclusion of trial, counsel requested that costs be reserved on the basis of Column IV, Schedule 1B of the Tariff of Costs. It is now clear that the applicant intended to make a submission for award of solicitor and client costs of approximately $70,000. Evidence was led at trial about insubstantial offers made directly between the parties. The further evidence now shows that substantial offers were made through counsel, although that evidence was not before the Court at trial. The applicant argued that the Court needed to know the full extent of the estate so as to properly determine the applicant’s entitlement to the estate. HELD: 1)The applicant was awarded costs in lump sum. The respondent was ordered to pay the applicant post-judgment interest at a rate of five percent per annum from the date of the award until judgment is satisfied.  2)The Executions Act states that interest runs “from the time of entering judgment” and not from when the offer was made. The Court was faced with two equally untenable positions in determining costs. If the costs of the litigation were to be paid from the award date, the remainder may be insufficient to meet the application by the applicant. A settlement offered in September 1996 would have been equivalent to approximately $230,000 but, following the pre-trial conference, the respondent offered settlement at $156,000 which would be roughly equivalent to 1/2 of that amount. In the alternative, the applicant sought solicitor & client costs to be Paid from September 1996, which would result in a reduction in approximately $5,000 in fees and disbursements.  3)In fixing an amount, the Court is faced with the dilemma of whether costs should be fixed at $20,000 or reduced to a lump sum, depending on the circumstances.

HELD: The application for a fixed award of costs was taken out. The court's discretion to award costs arises out of its inherent equitable jurisdiction and out of Rule 542 of The Queen's Bench Rules in assessing appropriate costs. Rule 343A contemplates amendment of judgment in these circumstances. There is a substantial monetary difference between the party and party costs awarded in the judgment and the solicitor and clients costs claimed by the applicant. This contributed to the respondent's unwillingness to disclose the financial worth of the estate and prolonged the litigation and as such should be considered judicially on the facts of the case.",0.3201376936316695

The judge declined to do so for the reason this was the respondent's first drug offence and she had no record of violence.

The offence will only be made out if the accused intentionally applied force directly or indirectly to the complainant, the complainant did not consent to the force applied, and she was forced off the road to avoid collision. 3)The Court reviewed the evidence and re-examined the evidence. There was nothing in the transcript which suggested that the judge took a zero tolerance approach to domestic assault without consideration to the fact that the manner in which the appellant drove was inherently dangerous. The evidence was nonetheless reasonably capable of supporting the Court's decision.",0.19168173598553348
e_2014skqb23.txt,"Civil Procedure Injunction HELD: The first portion of the statement of claim is an attempt by the plaintiff to have the Court take jurisdiction over a matter that is already before the Saskatchewan Human Rights Tribunal. While the court has jurisdiction to hear human rights complaints, the jurisdiction only arises after the tribunal process has been exhausted. Since the tribunal procedure has not been completed, the portions of the statement of claim dealing with the human rights complaint are stayed on the basis that the underlying issues may only be heard by the court upon application of the Chief Commissioner of the Saskatchewan Human Rights Code pursuant to s. 29.6 of the Code. With respect to the claim that the defendant breached The Animal Protection Act, the essence of the claim is to seek damages against the plaintiff for the loss of the service dog. That portion of the claim must be struck because the plaintiffs cannot circumvent the provisions of The Animal Protection Act, 1999 nor eliminate the defendant’s right to be charged and tried in Provincial Court through the expediency of claiming a declaration in a civil suit. The third claim is that the defendant was negligent in allowing other children to interact with the service dog will not be struck because, assuming the facts in the pleadings are true, the claim for damages is viable. Likewise, the fourth claim that the defendant intentionally inflicted mental and emotional suffering on the autistic plaintiff will not be struck as is not plain and obvious from the pleadings that the claim cannot succeed. The plaintiffs’ application for an interlocutory injunction was dismissed because the claims that have not been struck are not rationally connected to the injunction, even assuming the remaining claims present a serious issue to be tried they do not justify a finding that the plaintiffs will suffer irreparable harm if the injunction is refused and the balance of convenience weighs in favour of not granting an injunction.","The plaintiffs are the five children of the Lawless family who reside near Maryfield, Saskatchewan. Although the family has an English speaking background, the children attended École de Bellegarde, a French language school located approximately 35 km from Maryfield. Their attendance at the school was made possible by provisional permission granted to them by the school administration. In February 2013, the school informed the family that the children's provisional approval to attend the school would not be extended for the 2013-2014 school year. The Lawless children applied to strike out the statement of claim. HELD: The application to dismiss the claim was reserved, while the application for an interlocutory injunction was dismissed with written reasons.  1)Not all Canadian citizens have the right to have their children educated in French. Sections 23(1) and (2) of the Charter state that 23.(1) Citizens of Canada (a) whose first language learned and still understood is that of the English or French linguistic minority population of the province in which they reside, or (b) who reside in the United States, to exercise general supervision and control over French language instruction programs and fransaskois schools in Saskatchewan.  2) Not all Canadians have a right to an education in French, and neither this Court nor the SHRC may inquire into its reasons or interfere with the exercise of its discretion.  3) The lawless children's claim should be struck under Rule 7-9-2(e) of The Queen's Bench Rules as an abuse of process because the plaintiffs never applied for judicial review to set aside the appeal decision rendered by the elected directors of the CÉF, and they consistently referred to the defendant as the 'CÉF'.","[71] For all of the above reasons, the plaintiffs’ claims for a declaration that the CÉF violated ss. 12(1) and 13(1) of the Code will be stayed on the basis that the underlying issues may only be heard by the court upon an application by the Chief Commissioner of the SHRC pursuant to s. 29.6 of the Code. They seek a declaration that the CÉF contravened s. 23.2(1) of The Animal Protection Act, 1999, by interfering with the use of a service animal. The claim will be struck pursuant to Queen’s Bench Rules 7-9 (2)(a) and (e). For these reasons, the claim will not be struck pursuant to Rules 7-9 (2) (a) or (e) of The Queen’s Bench Rules. Accordingly it will not be struck pursuant to either Rule 7-9 (2) (a) or 7-9 (2) (e). [86] I turn now to my specific reasons for dismissing the plaintiffs’ application for an interlocutory injunction ordering the CÉF to admit the plaintiffs to École de Bellegarde. 2. Even assuming that the remaining claims present a serious issue to be tried, they do not justify a finding that the plaintiffs will suffer irreparable harm if the injunction is refused. [89] Quite apart from the pleadings, the facts do not demonstrate that an injunction will be necessary to prevent irreparable harm. [94] For all of these reasons, the plaintiffs application for an interlocutory injunction was dismissed. CONCLUSION [95] With respect to the defendant’s application for an order striking out the plaintiffs’ claim:


1. The plaintiffs’ claims for a declaration that the CÉF has violated their rights under ss. 12(1) and 13(1) of The Saskatchewan Human Rights Code, both directly and as “collateral damage”, are stayed pending an application to the court pursuant to s. 29.6 of the Code. 2. The plaintiffs’ claim that the defendant has violated ss. 23.2(1) of The Animal Protection Act, 1999 is struck out. 3. The CÉF’s application for an order striking out the plaintiffs’ claim for special damages arising from alleged negligence in relation to the service dog, Tank, is dismissed; and 4.

1995canlii4465.txt,"The plaintiffs statement of claim was served on the defendant in Ontario two days after it was issued. Two weeks later the prothonotary issued default judgment for $8,000, plus $2,880 in interest and $404.42 in costs. The defendant applied, pursuant to Civil Procedure Rule 12.06, to set aside the default judgment, on the ground that the plaintiff did not meet the requirements for obtaining a default judgment from the prothonotary or, in the alternative, on the merits that it had, by affidavit evidence, raised triable issues and provided a reasonable excuse for its failure to file a defence. Dismissing the application with costs of $1,000 to the plaintiff, that although the plaintiff ought to have sought the court's leave to take default judgment such a procedural ommission did not, in the circumstances, prejudice the defendant. Further, while there were triable issues between the parties, the defendant's failure to file a defence was neither a mistake nor an oversight, but rather a deliberate decision so as not to attorn to Nova Scotia jurisdiction, and therefore was not a reasonable excuse.","The plaintiff was the successor corporation of an amalgamated company which included Sweeney. The parties entered into a so-called Letter Arrangement whereby the defendant would conduct detailed energy performance evaluations of the plaintiff's operations and make recommendations for improvements and reductions in costs. The plaintiff paid the defendant what it called a deposit and what the defendant calls service fee of Eight Thousand Dollars ($8,000). The defendant agreed to pay the plaintiff Fifty Percent of every energy savings enjoyed for a period of sixty months, provided such savings were the result of whatever of the defendants' recommendations were approved by and implemented by the plaintiff. The default judgment was set aside as being premature, as it was obtained before the time limit for making an appearance had expired. The defendant did not want strings attached to it securing setting aside of the default judgment. It did not relish giving up its present leverage in a way that would allow the defendant to pursue the litigation in Ontario at considerable cost and inconvenience to the plaintiff, who is without any presence there. The defendants had not brought itself within the scope of the remarks of Chief Justice Cowan in Pinard and Pinard v. Bushell et al. (1975), 20 N.S.R. (2d) 317 at p.375. HELD: The defendant's application was dismissed with costs. 1)The plaintiff's mistake was not one of substance rendering its claim for relief nullity. It had the right to default.

If he does not have particulars of the statutes and regulations, he must so state. 2) The court was not prepared to strike the phrases 'without limiting the generality of the foregoing' and 'without limitation'. The conduct of examination for discovery and undertakings can provide the defendant with particulars of allegations to be made by the plaintiff in order to permit it to properly defend the action.  3) The Government demanded full particulars of the breach of trust and breach of fiduciary duty. The plaintiff's response does not lay a foundation for either and the paragraphs are struck.  4) The court was satisfied that exemplary damages and punitive damages were synonymous and therefore only one of them should be pled to avoid confusion.
