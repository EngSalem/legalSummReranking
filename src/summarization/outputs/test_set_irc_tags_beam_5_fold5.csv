Sentencing the offender to four months consecutive imprisonment on each count, for a total of twenty months, and ordering restitution to the victims,  that the sentence must serve as a message of deterrence to all individuals who hold positions of trust and authority.

b_2014skqb81.txt,"Limitation of Actions – Mortgage – Saskatchewan Farmland SecurityHELD: When s. 12 of The Saskatchewan Farm Security Act was enacted it was the legislature’s intention that a mortgagee, to whom The Saskatchewan Farm Security Act applied, could suspend the limitation period clock from running and after serving a notice of intention to enforce its security, provided that within three years of such service the mortgagee made application to the court for an order under s. 11 permitting it to commence an enforcement action. If the three years for making such an application expires without an application being made, the limitation period begins to run again. The notice of extension in this case expired in 2009 and the limitation clock began to run again. The limitation period for the commencement of an action to enforce the respondent’s mortgage has expired and the registration of the mortgage is ordered discharged.","HELD: The application was granted. The court ordered that the registration of mortgage against land be discharged on the basis that the limitation period to enforce the mortgage has expired. The respondent’s mortgage was registered at the Land Titles Office and continued to date as Interest Registration No. 106597705. The notice of extension had expired on the expiry of 150 days from the date of its service on February 28, 2006. The limitation period had substantially expired before the service of the initial notice of intention and it expired within the day. The applicant was awarded the taxable costs of her application against the respondent. As the respondent had failed to initiate any action, the application for an order under s. 11(1) expired."

Granting the order relating to the settlement amount, but setting aside the contingency fee agreement, that Civil Procedure Rule 63.19(1) requires that all contingency fee agreements be filed with the prothonotary.

The settlement proposed for approval was the sum proposed for payment of 30% of the sum settled upon plus disbursements.

9_2014skqb386.txt,"The appeal was allowed, and rather than order a new trial, the charge was stayed. The issues were decided as follows: 1) the trial judge was found to have applied the wrong test as to de facto care and control of the vehicle. The appeal on the first ground was dismissed, however, because the Crown could rely on the presumption in s. 258(1)(c); the accused had been driving 10 minutes before the stop and within two hours of the breath tests, so whether he was in de facto care and control at the time of the stop was irrelevant and did not result in a miscarriage of justice; 2) there was no evidence of the failure to observe the appellant while the breath tests were administered, nor was there a suggestion of the significance of the failure to do so, therefore, the appeal on that ground was dismissed; 3) the trial judge also addressed the issue of evidence if the 2008 amendments did not apply and the appellant was therefore not prejudiced in this regard. The appellant nonetheless argued that the trial judge erred in law by misapprehending evidence. The appeal court concluded that the trial judge did not err in law because his reasons did not disclose that he failed to consider relevant evidence relating to a material issue;  4) the Crown conceded that the 2008 amendments did not apply retroactively. The appeal court found that the trial judge was incorrect in giving a strong message to the unrepresented appellant that there was no point in tendering evidence on the accuracy of the Intoxilyzer results. The trial judge’s comments strongly suggested that the only expert evidence that would be relevant would be with respect to equipment malfunction and not operator error. The appeal was granted on this ground because the trial judge’s comments were found to compromise trial fairness resulting in an error of law; 5) the s. 9 Charter breach was not raised by the appellant at trial but it was raised in his brief following trial, and therefore the appeal court found that the trial judge was obliged to decide whether or not to consider the issue. The appeal was also allowed on this ground because the trial judge did not comply with his duty to consider the issue and the appeal court could not determine whether the failure to give reasons resulted in a miscarriage of justice; and 6) there was no issue of trial fairness. The appeal court concluded that there would be prejudice to the integrity of the justice system that would be manifested if the appellant had a fourth trial. Nine and a half years passed since the offence date and the facts of the case were less serious than some drinking and driving cases. Also, there was no other remedy available to remedy the wrong. The balancing of interests also led the court to conclude that this was one of those clearest of cases calling for a stay of proceedings.","The appellant was convicted of having care and control of a motor vehicle while his blood alcohol content exceeded 80 milligrams of alcohol in 100 millilitres of blood, contrary to s. 253(b) of the Criminal Code. He appealed his conviction. Corrigendum received dated March 6, 2015 and added to fulltext. HELD: The appeal was granted.  1) Given the presumption in s. 258(1)(c)(iv) that the person who occupies the driver's seat is deemed to have care or control, the trial judge considered whether the appellant had rebutted the presumption so as to rebut the presumption of accuracy, he had no reasonable doubt as to the guilt of the accused. The Court of Appeal allowed the appeal from the bench and, rather than ordering a fourth trial, stayed the proceedings.  2) Given that the presumption is rebutting, the appellant was found to have been in actual care of control. The trial judge in this case adopted the reasoning of Green P.C.J. at the second trial and adopted his own reasoning. He found that, just barely, in the opinion of the appellant, he was definitely in actual control of his vehicle at the time of the offence. He also found that the RCMP did not err in not asking the appellant what he had been drinking that day and whether he had consumed beer within fifteen minutes of taking the roadside test. The Crown did not take issue with the appellant's assertion that his consumption of beer was the two beers at the scene and that he was simply mistaken for to the amount of alcohol he consumed that day or was deliberately misleading the Court in an attempt to defeat this charge. 3) The evidence of the roadside instrument and the Intoxilizer readings simply could not have been obtained by the consumption of one or two beers while stopped at the roadside in the manner the accused described. Prosecutorial misconduct and improper motivation are but two of many factors to be taken into account when a Crown seeks to re-lay the indictment. The appellant has not established an abuse of process. The facts of the case are unremarkable. It's not one of those clearest of cases where the court should direct a judicial stay."
d_2001nsca44.txt,"The appellant was convicted of criminal negligence causing death, causing death in the operation of a motor vehicle while impaired by alcohol, criminal negligence causing bodily harm, and causing bodily harm while under the influence of alcohol. The appellant advanced several grounds of appeal, including that her s. 10 Charter rights had been infringed because she had not been informed of the extent of her jeopardy, namely that there had been serious injuries and perhaps a fatality, before having to respond to a breathalyser demand. She claimed that this should have resulted in a stay of all charges. She also alleged that lost evidence resulted in a breach of her s. 7 Charter right to make full answer and defence. Dismissing the appeal, that assuming without deciding that the appellant's s. 10 Charter right was breached, no evidence was obtained as a result of the breach which was heard by the jury. Further, the evidence which was lost was not an issue in the trial. Finally, there were no errors by the judge on any of the other grounds advanced for appeal.","Following a trial in the Supreme Court, before Justice Simon MacDonald and a jury, the appellant was convicted of four offences arising out of her operation of a motor vehicle. The appellant appealed her conviction, and raised numerous grounds of appeal. In none of these grounds did the appellant take the position that the jury's verdict was unreasonable and cannot be supported by the evidence. The only evidence heard on this application was that of Constable Towle of the R.C.M.P. detachment. Flinn, J.A., Chipman and Cromwell, JJ.A. concurring."
5_2007skca90.txt,"These appeals concern a referendum on the question of whether the University of Saskatchewan Student's Union should join the Canadian Federation of Students (the Federation). The referendum was held in the fall of 2005. A majority of the students voted in favour of joining the Federation. The respondent Robin Mowat then applied to the Court of Queen's Bench pursuant to The Non-profit Corporations Act (the Act) and obtained an order declaring the referendum to be of no force or effect. The Federation and the Student's Union now seek to overturn that order. They argue that Mowat had no standing to bring his application and that the Chambers judge erred in his application of the relevant statutory provisions. HELD: The appeals must be dismissed. 1) The respondent is a 'proper person' to bring the application pursuant s. 222(d) of the Act. He was attending the University and very actively involved on campus and the referendum campaign. Over 44% of the students voted against joining the Federation. The Act gives the right to make an application to a complainant, not to a complainant who speaks for a significant portion of the members of a corporation. The fact that the respondent's application was argued a few months after the respondent had convocated should not defeat his right to bring his concerns forward. An individual's status as a student is inevitably temporary. There is no justice in denying the respondent's standing only because the process for reviewing the referendum results played out so slowly that he was unable to bring the matter before a court prior to the date of his convocation.  2) The Controverted election cases are not applicable in the circumstances of this case. Section 225 of the Act creates and delimits a statutory remedy for particular kinds of corporate conduct. The assessment of an application pursuant to s. 225 of the Act must be measured against the concepts of oppression, unfair prejudice and unfair disregard as provided in that section. Administrative law concepts should be imported into that analysis only with considerable care and only for the purpose of giving meaning to the statutory terms found in the section itself. 3) The critical point is that the Council abandoned a formal process which had been put in place specifically to address the very significant concerns raised by the respondent and other about the referendum. Whether that turn of events was somehow inevitable is not the real issue. Rather, the essence of this case is the unfairness and prejudice the Council's decision involved for those who had opposed joining the Federation. It is unnecessary to look more closely at the specific problems that arose in relation to the referendum process. The decision of the Student's Union to override the decision of the Elections Board was itself something that warranted the granting of relief pursuant to s. 225 of the Act.","HELD: The appeals were dismissed. The court found that the respondent had no standing to bring his application pursuant to s. 225 of The Non-profit Corporations Act and that the Chambers judge had made errors in his approach to the application of the relevant statutory provisions. The respondent was a 'proper person' to bring the application. He attended the University from the fall of 2000 to the spring of 2006 and was actively involved in the referendum process. He was a member of the Students' Union during the referendum campaign and was a leading voice against joining the Federation. The Chambers judge found that, even if he had standing, he was not entitled to the relief granted by the judge."
c_2005skqb166.txt,"The accused was charged with impaired driving contrary to s. 255(1) and s. 253(a) of the Criminal Code and with driving while over .08 contrary to s. 253(b) and s. 255(1) of the Criminal Code. The accused was convicted of impaired driving. An initial question is whether the trial judge's decision reflected a conviction on both counts or a conviction only for the impaired driving charge. HELD: The appeal is allowed and the conviction is set aside with an order that a new trial be held. 1) The court found a conviction was not entered on the .08 charge and the judicial stay was not used by the trial judge to avoid a multiplicity of convictions. 2) There was an error in law in that the trial judge relied at least in part on the certificate readings for his conclusion of impairment. What the verdict would have been, absent the trial judge's consideration of the certificate, is not clear. The matter must be resolved in favour of the accused. As the court was of the opinion that the remaining admissible evidence could have resulted in a like verdict, a new trial is ordered.","The accused was charged with operating a motor vehicle while his ability was impaired by alcohol under ss.255(1) and 253(a) of the Criminal Code and, secondly, with having consumed alcohol in such a quantity that his blood alcohol level exceeded.08 contrary to ss.253(b) and 255(1). The trial judge concluded that the impaired driving charge was stronger than the breathalyzer readings and the accused offered an innocent explanation for them. HELD: The appeal was allowed and the conviction set aside. The entry of a judicial stay on the.08 charge was not used to avoid a multiple conviction issue. Volume of consumption falls within the provisions of s. 253(b). The mechanism for doing so is the entering of judicial stays on the charge that is less serious when convicting of the more serious. However, the trial judge found that the erratic driving pattern, his unsteadiness and fumbling, coupled with his admissions and odour of alcohol are matters which, if accepted by a properly instructed finder of facts, could have resulted in conviction. The accused's driving behaviour was attributable to his hurt ankle and was not as result of any impairment from the considerable alcohol that he had, he had drank. The only foundation for the conclusion of impairment articulated in his rather rambling reasons for judgment are references to beer consumption some hours earlier and '[t]he reading shows he is more than twice the legal limit.' The conditional stay becomes permanent and equivalent to an acquittal for both appeal purposes and autrefois acquit purposes."
4_1996canlii6841.txt,"The respondent conducted an audit resulting in the assessment of sales tax. Husky Oil appealed the decision by the Board of Revenue Commissioners which held Husky liable to pay tax on documentation charges. The primary function of the documentation was ongoing technical support for the valves operation, maintenance and modifications. The valves and documentation were identified as separate items on the same purchase order and arrived at the job site separately. The Board decided that the appellant purchased the documentation independent of the valves and were subject to tax under ss.5(9) unless exempted under ss.8(1)(f). The parties agreed the documents fell within the definition of tangible property as set out in the Act. At issue was the interpretation by the Board of the word 'published' as used in ss.5(1)(b) of eg. 1 when defining the word 'books' and whether the drawings were exempt from tax. HELD: The appeal was allowed and the decision of the Board reversed. Costs were awarded to the appellant. 1)The role of the Court was in the nature of judicial review and supervisory in nature. The Court's role on questions of fact is restricted to circumstances where the evidence does not support findings of fact. 2)There was evidence which could support either interpretation of the facts.  3)The determination of whether the documents were required for preparing the property for use in Saskatchewan is a question of fact. There was nothing technical about the statutory requirement. The words used are simple and ordinary. It was open to the Board to determine as a finding of fact that the documentation was not required for preparing the valves for use. 4)Technical papers by their nature are often going to a narrow audience. To focus upon the extent to which technical papers are directed at a public audience so as to determine their taxability makes no sense and is at odds with the proposition that technical papers can be exempt from tax. The broad interpretation eliminates this anomaly.  5)Having determined that the word published is intended to speak to purpose and not to extent of the audience it was not necessary to comment upon the definition adopted by the Board.","HELD: The appeal was allowed and the decision of the Board of Revenue Commissioners reversed. Husky appealed. The issue raised was the interpretation adopted by the board of the word 'published' asused in s. 5(1)(b) of the Education and Health Tax Act. If, as the board found, the purchase of the drawings was an independenttransaction, was it exempt from tax by virtue of s. 8 of the Act? 1)There was no guideline or criteria for the taxing authority to apply. The evidence before the board was more consistent with documentation charges being part of the purchase than documentation charges. 2)The respondent did not pay taxon what is referred to asDocumentation charges. Section 22 of the Revenue and Financial Services Act requires that findings of fact made by the Board are to be accepted and applied in any judicial review of the board's decision. It is of no consequence but might say find no difficulty in accepting the Board's conclusion on this important factual determination. 3)The issue raised by Husky was whether the documents were required for preparing the property for use in Saskatchewan. The Board determined as finding of fact that the documentation was not required for preparation for the purposes of preparing the valves. There was evidence that could support eitherinterpretation of the facts. The broad interpretation eliminates this anomaly. 4)Husky appealed to the Board which upheld the assessment."
2011skca19.txt,"The accused, a member of the RCMP, was convicted after trial of assault with a weapon contrary to s. 267(1)(a). The accused successfully appealed his conviction to the Court of Queen's Bench where a new trial was ordered. The Queen's Bench Judge held that the trial judge's reasons were inconsistent on the whether the accused reasonably believed that he was about to be grievously harmed and that the trial judge erred by not considering the evidence of the other police officer who testified at the trial. The Crown appealed to the Court of Appeal arguing that the summary conviction appeal judge misinterpreted the trial judge's reasons and exceeded the bounds of appellate review. HELD: The appeal was allowed and the conviction restored. The summary conviction appeal court judge erred in finding that the trial judge's reasons were inconsistent. The trial judge engaged in classical alternative reasoning. While the trial judge did not refer to all of the evidence, he did not err in failing to do so. The trial judge grappled with the substance of the issues presented at the trial which were whether the accused had been assaulted by the complainant, whether the accused reasonably believed that he was being assaulted and whether his response was proportionate. The trial judge based his conclusions on the whole of the evidence rather than preferring the evidence of one witness over another. An appellate court is not entitled to overturn a verdict simply because the trial judge placed more weight on some portions of the record than others.","The Crown applied for leave to appeal pursuant to s. 839 of the Criminal Code. The trial judge quashed the conviction and ordered a new trial. The Crown appealed. HELD: The Court granted leave and allowed the appeal in judgment from the bench. The following facts are taken from the trial judgment or are uncontroverted: 1) the trial judge did not direct himself to all of the relevant evidence resulting in a reviewable error. He did not address the appellant's assessment of the options available to him in the context of what he was facing. The appellant's action was necessary to protect himself against a perceived threat and was not based on an inconsistency with the evidence of the three witnesses. It is not unreasonable to expect the defence of self-defence to be reasonable in circumstances where the officer is armed with pepper spray and there is another officer present. It was not unreasonable for the officer to react in a manner that he did not believe was reasonable. 2) While it is true that the officer was preparing for an altercation and that he was afraid there was going to be a fight, the Court judge tested that evidence against the officer's actual actions. The officer did not take any steps such as pulling out his baton to deal with a dangerous or threatening situation. The appeal judge erred in both ways. The Appeal judge found that the accused's reasons do not reflect an inconsistency and the Court was not entitled to overturn the verdict."
e_2004skqb372.txt,"This is an appeal by the City of Regina (the City) and Canadian Union of Public Employees Local 21 (CUPE) from a decision of the Tribunal under The Saskatchewan Human Rights Code (the Code) in the matter of complaints filed by the respondent against the City and CUPE. It became clear that the main issues on the appeal were the duty to accommodate and the alleged resignation of the respondent. The respondent filed a complaint under Part II of the Code alleging that CUPE and the City discriminated against him on the basis of his disability. The Commission substantiated this allegation before the Tribunal by showing there was a discriminatory impact on the respondent as a result of the seniority system established by the collective agreements in force from time to time between the City and CUPE. The Tribunal found that all of the efforts made in response to the respondent did not deal directly and effectively with his claim that the seniority standards in the collective agreement were discriminatory towards him on the basis of his disability. The Tribunal agreed with the Commission that their efforts were too little too late to reverse the systemic discrimination. The accommodations did not meet the duty to accommodate short of undue hardship. The Tribunal found that the City and CUPE contravened s. 16 and s. 18(1) of the Code by discriminating against the respondent on the basis of his disability. HELD: The appeals by the City and CUPE on liability are dismissed. The parties were allowed to refer the issue of damages to the Tribunal. 1) The superior expertise of human rights tribunal is confined to fact finding and decision making in the context of human rights and therefore reasonableness is the test for judicial review. If the issue is one of law, the standard of review is one of correctness. In other words, the appropriate standard of review by superior court of factual determination is whether the decision is patently unreasonable. Where human rights commission is required to interpret laws of general application, the correctness test applies. 2) The Court agreed with the Commission that the seniority system prevented a person such as the respondent from ever getting a permanent position, without accommodation, by giving priority to all those who could work more hours or gain permanent status by being flexible enough to work at the wide range of positions that the City had to offer. The respondent could not take advantage of this reward system because he could only bid into truck driver positions. The City and CUPE were too late in developing the plan. The plan was conceived in early 1999 to be executed when the respondent reached the top of the seniority list, probably in about 2000. But by this time, he was unable to work. 3) The characterization of the order of the Tribunal is not to direct the respondent be given a permanent position despite the seniority rights of others. It is to give him the benefits he would have had if his seniority had accrued in a non-discriminatory manner. 4) Whether CUPE had knowledge of the problem is irrelevant. The breach occurs as soon as there is discrimination. The City and CUPE are jointly responsible where a collective bargaining agreement that they negotiated is discriminatory. 5) For either the City or CUPE to avoid liability they must discharge their duty to accommodate up to the point of undue hardship. 6) The Tribunal's finding that there was no undue hardship is supported by the evidence. There are approximately 1,400 casual and permanent positions. Moving the respondent up the seniority list would have relegated certain union members in a large bargaining unit by one, which is insignificant. If this occurred, although the respondent would obtain the next permanent position, this would not be in disregard of the rights of other employees. Neither the City nor CUPE presented any evidence that would establish that a retroactive adjustment itself would create an undue hardship in the context that it would cause the seniority list to become unmanageable or ambiguous. It is not without significance that even if the membership of CUPE opposed the placing of the respondent into a permanent position, this by itself does not justify a finding of undue hardship. 7) The mandate of the Tribunal, once a finding of discrimination is made, is to determine what losses are caused by the discriminatory conduct. The Tribunal found that the respondent's resignation was one effect of the discrimination. The Court found there was no merit to this ground of appeal.","This is an appeal by the City of Regina and Canadian Union of Public Employees Local 21 (CUPE) from a decision dated October 10, 2003, of Roger J. F. LePage sitting as a Tribunal under The Saskatchewan Human Rights Code. HELD: The appeal is dismissed. 1) The Court found that the tribunal erred in law in finding that the City was responsible for the discrimination against the applicant on the basis of his disability. CUPE had no claim to the right to be recalled into the position of permanent employee based on seniority. 2) The tribunal failed to take into account the applicant's disability. The fact that the applicant had Cerebral Palsy made his complaint within the Code's limitation period irrelevant. It was impossible for the applicant to gain employment with the City because of the entry-level position. The requirement of building up seniority as a driver presented an insurmountable barrier for the Applicant. The tribunal was negligent in failing to find the City accommodated the Applicant adequately, reasonably and to the point of undue hardship. The Applicant's numerous attempts to gain permanent status were unsuccessful. His frustration with the city and its administration was heightened once he became aware of other casual employees, hired after the applicant, passing him on the seniority list. The applicant's casual employment hours always entitled him to collect Employment Insurance in the winter."

It was clear that the accused was confused and not focused on the present and that his mind had wandered off to the need to acquire counsel to represent him at trial as opposed to his immediate right to have counsel. His muttered reply created enough uncertainty that the officer should have made an effort to clarify the informational component of the right to counsel.","The accused was charged with aggravated assault, use or threatened use of weapon, unlawful possession of a weapon and failure to comply with his recognizance of August 2, 2008. The Crown had sought admission of the accused's statements made during the course of his detention, first on s. 87 Liquor Control Act violation for public drunkenness and then on the more serious charges as he became almost immediately the suspect in the assault on the same street person as they were known to be heavy drinkers who shared the porch. The accused was given his Charter rights and was advised of his right to contact counsel without delay and right to duty counsel. He was asked if he understood his rights and the accused replied, 'Probably be one down around there anyway.' The police would have been aware of the misunderstanding and as result, they were required to clear up any misunderstanding the accused may have exhibited about his rights. HELD: The accused's Charter rights were not breached voluntarily. He did not fall under the protection of the Charter, nor did he display a lack of insight or insight into the circumstances in which he was required to make these statements. Although he was clearly intoxicated at the time of the statement, he remained alert and able to make informed decisions based on the information contained in the statement. It would be egregious to exclude the statement from evidence. 1) Access to counsel is the gateway of Charter rights particularly in these circumstances where this statement is the only evidence to be offered by the Crown in seeking conviction. The defence submits that this response exhibited a fundamental misunderstanding by the accused of his basic constitutional rights under s. 10(b). They knew the accused and he knew of his difficulties with addiction. The entire case of the police would be held in disrepute. 2) It is a different situation than those cases involving guns and narcotics. There is an absolute fundamental right to get advice from counsel before making a statement to the police. It is essential that the information component of the right to counsel be comprehensive in scope and that it be presented by police authorities in a 'timely and comprehensible manner'. The accused wandered off to the need to acquire counsel to represent him at trial. The Court does not believe he was focussed on the present and his immediate right to have counsel then and there before he made any statement. His muttered reply created enough uncertainty for the Court to make a clarification such as, 'Brian, have the right now before you make any statement to us'."

The petitioner intends to challenge the legislation dealing with custody and access but was unaware he is required to serve notice under the Constitutional Questions Act.","The parties appealed the decision of the Court of Appeal in July 1999. They agreed that the respondent was no longer residing in the trailer court and that the matter should be remitted to the trial judge. Approximately 2 years have elapsed since the decision. In the interval there have been numerous applications which the parties have brought before the Court. In addition, the parties has been involved in pre-trial. HELD: The application to vary was to proceed by way of an application for vary and the issue raised by the decision in the Courtof Appeal will be subsumed in that application. There was no order of costs.  There were numerous changes of circumstances which went far beyond the single issue on which the Appeal directed be returned."

The child is the petitioner's son from a prior relationship. The petitioner plans to have the child live with his biological father in Edmonton so that he can get the specialized medical care that he requires. When the petitioner and the respondent separated, they consented to a judgment, which granted the petitioner custody of the child and gave access rights to the respondent. The consent judgment provided that the petitioner was to provide the respondent with 90 days notice of any proposed change in the child's residence. Notice of the upcoming move was provided to the respondent. HELD: The application was dismissed. The consent judgment does not require the petitioner to get an order before changing the child's residence. An application will be required by the petitioner to vary the access arrangements with the respondent.","The respondent sought an order prohibiting the petitioner from removing the child from Saskatchewan until she obtained a Court order allowing her to do so. The petitioner had two children from two prior relationships. Her daughter was presently 16 years old and her son, 10 years old, would be in February. The consent judgment provided that the respondent would have reasonable access to the child every second weekend from Friday evening to Sunday evening and one week in each of July and August. HELD: The application was dismissed with costs. Nothing in the judgment referred to above required the petitioner to obtain such an order. Even though the respondent had been advised, after numerous attempts, that there was no one in place to provide the counselling and treatment that the child required, the child had been seen by an education psychologist in Eastend."
4_1994canlii5226.txt,"The parties divided their matrimonial property in 1985 by agreement as confirmed in a consent order. The order provided that when the husband retired, the wife would receive, as her vested share of his pension, 40% of his benefit. The order also provided that the parties could apply for further directions as necessary. After the husband's retirement, the wife sought to receive her share of the pension from the employer as a lump sum. The husband objected, claiming that he was entitled to any remaining benefit from her share in the event she should predecease him. The wife applied for directions. HELD: The wife is entitled to her share of the pension in any form permitted by the terms of the pension plan. She is also entitled to leave her interest in the pension to a named beneficiary, without reference to or the consent of the husband.","The parties married in 1952 and were divorced in 1984. Matrimonial property was settled by the parties in 1985. The university pension of the former wife was divided as follows: (a) the share vested in the applicant was not now in any way under the control of the applicant; (b) if the respondent retires at age 60, the share of the pension to be received by the applicant shall be set out above with the remaining share to be paid to his estate; (c) the university was to make monthly payments directly from the pension plan to the applicant. Whether this is converted to a lump sum payment or continues as monthly payments is exclusively the concern of the University of Regina and the applicant HELD: The application for further directions was dismissed. 1)The court found that the 40% share, having vested the applicant, was a share she may deal with without reference to,or the consent of, the respondent. 2)The order of December 19, 1985 did not contemplate joint ownership or any implied right of survivorship. Accordingly, the 40 per cent share, which had vested the respondent, is a weight sum benefit which the parties apply for a further clarification of their intentions. 3)The applicant was to receive $2,314.69 or 60% of the total pension. $300 was fixed at $300 with costs to the successful party."

She relied upon Civil Procedure Rules 15.07 and 15.08. Dismissing the appeal, that the appellant's application was an effort to compel a retrospective consideration of past circumstances of the child rather than an assessment of her current circumstances. The proper remedy would be for the applicant to apply for a termination of the order under s. 48 of the Children and Family Services Act.","This was an appeal from a decision of a Family Court judge declining to rescind an order in 1993 for permanent care and custody of the appellant's granddaughter. The basis on which the application was made was that the appellant consented to or agreed with the 1993 order on the faith of the agency's then plan of care which envisaged that adoption plans would be initiated by the appellant. Unfortunately, the appellant had a drug dependency problem and by June 1995 was hospitalized. The husband reported the problem to the Agency, which sought its intervention because he alone could not care for the child. The appellant sought rescission of the order in question on the authority of Rule 1.04 of the Family Court Rules. Dismissing the application without costs, that the procedure adopted is an effort to compel a retrospective consideration of the past circumstances of the child rather than an assessment of her present circumstances. If the court is wrong in that regard, the court cannot find it is in S.'s best interest to issue a retroactive custody order under the Family Maintenance Act."
b_2001canlii2619.txt,"The accused was charged with impaired driving causing bodily harm. Expert evidence was given based on blood samples taken after the accident that the accused was impaired; this opinion was based on two assumptions, namely, that the accused had not consumed alcohol within half an hour of the accident, nor after the accident. The Crown did not offer any evidence to prove these assumptions and, in fact, there was a three hour period prior to the accident where there was no evidence of what the accused, who did not testify, was doing. Acquitting the accused, that the expert evidence cannot be tendered by the Crown to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the accused had been impaired. The remainder of the evidence against the accused was insufficient to prove the accused's doubt beyond a reasonable doubt.","A 21 year old friend of the accused was charged with criminal negligence causing death after she observed a white vehicle go over the centre line of the highway by a few inches for approximately 20 seconds. The accused was later found to be the operator of the vehicle. Viva voce evidence was heard at that time regarding the contact point between the driver's vehicle and the oncoming vehicle. HELD: The Court held that the proof of impairment consists of observations of conduct in most cases and where the conduct is a slight departure from normal activity, it would be unsafe to conclude beyond a reasonable doubt that the person's ability to operate motor vehicle is impaired by alcohol or drugs.  1)It was assumed that the white vehicle was not speeding but it was coming into collision with oncoming traffic travelling in the proper lane and thus causing an accident. 2)The blood alcohol reading taken from the victim was accurately recorded as 216 milligrams of alcohol per 100 millilitres of blood, which was within the range of background interference for the test equipment.  3)Although the accused's condition may have affected her ability to drive, the initial reading of her blood alcohol level at 12:10 p.m. was accurate, as was the extrapolation of that reading back to the time of the operation of the motor vehicle in the same day.  4)The accused was found to have been inebriated. 5)The Court rejected the defence's submission that the hospital laboratory analysis was derived from blood serum rather than whole blood.  6)The onus is on the crown to prove the elements of the remaining offences before the Court beyond reasonable doubt.  7)The trial judge found that the evidence of impairment was so frail as to leave the trial judge with reasonable doubt, and that the accused must be acquitted."
3_1999skqb140.txt,"An action for payments owing on vehicles leased by Standard from Redhead and for parts and labour supplied by Redhead to the leased vehicles. At issue was whether Hyndman had an obligation in contract or equity for the lease payments and repairs from September 1993 until February 1994 based on discussions in 1993. There was no correspondence between the parties confirming the terms of the agreement. It was agreed that the discussions concerned the fact that Standard was not solvent at that date and that Hyndman entered an arrangement with Standard to operate under Hyndman's authority; Hyndman would make payments but would not agree to having the leases assigned to them. In issue was for how long the lease payments were to continue and on what conditions. HELD: The action against Hyndman was dismissed with taxable costs. Standard did not enter a defence to Redhead's claim and had been noted in default. Judgment was entered against Standard for $63,267.49 for the outstanding lease payments and parts and service account plus pre-judgment interest calculated from March 1994 to the date of judgment pursuant to the Pre-judgment Interest Act. 1)Redhead's claim against Hyndman was dismissed as there was no contractual relationship between the companies respecting the lease payments. Any verbal arrangement was never verified. It was clear that Hyndman refused to assume the obligations on the leases; that Redhead knew of the risk because of Standard's insolvency and was prepared to take that risk. 2)The facts did not establish appropriate circumstances for an award based on either quantum meruit or unjust enrichment. The actions taken were for the benefit of Standard in an attempt to keep it operational.  3)The claim against Hyndman for unpaid repairs was not proven. Hyndman did make some payments on behalf of Standard for repairs although there was no specific contract to do so.  It was not established that the accounts were forwarded, that Hyndman had notice of the unpaid invoices or issued a purchase order number authorizing the repairs. Hyndman gave notice to Redhead that they would not be obligated for repairs without a purchase order number.","The only witness called at trial was the defendant, who did not appear at trial and entered a defence in defence of the allegations in the statement of claim. The issue was whether the defendant had an obligation to the plaintiff, either in contract or equity for the lease payments on the vehicles and for the repairs to them for the period from September 1993 until February 11, 1994. HELD: The plaintiff's claim with respect to the unpaid repairs against the defendant was not proven and the portion of the claim dismissed. The defendant, Hyndman, was awarded taxable costs.  1)It was clear from the defendant's notes and the evidence at trial that there was a risk to the arrangement because of Standard's insolvency and that the plaintiff might not be paid on the leases. 2)The actions taken by both the defendant and the plaintiff in an attempt to keep it operational were taken for the benefit of the company. As it turned out, neither Redhead nor the plaintiff benefited from this arrangement for very long and both lost money. The facts of this case did not satisfy me on a balance of probabilities that this was an appropriate circumstance for an award in favour of the plaintiff based on either quantum meruit or unjust enrichment.  3)Costs. Although there was no specific contract regarding the repair of the leased vehicles, it was clear that the defendant did make some payments on behalf of Standard in respect to some work orders that were issued by Redhead. Both parties were responsible for maintaining the company operational. Both lost money and neither benefited.  4)The claim of unpaid invoices was also dismissed. Neither the plaintiff's lawyer nor the defendant appeared to know how the repairs were authorized for the vehicles. The evidence of Cox and on review of the documents themselves appeared to show that the payments by the defendant for work on the vehicle were made either under the direction of Bennett or for work that was done where a specific purchase order number was supplied by Hyn. Based on Cox's notes, the defendant gave notice to Redhead that they would not be obligated for repairs without a purchasing order number once they realized there may have been a misapprehension by Standard's creditors with regard to the payment of these accounts. 5)The evidence of Duda was that his employer had not seen the repairs authorized for Standard. Duda's evidence was that he believed the defendant would not assume the obligations on the Redhead and Standard leases and that Redhead was prepared to assume that risk.

4_1999skqb3.txt,"The plaintiff was the coordinator of post-secondary education programs for White Bear First Nation, between 1990 until his termination in May 1997. The plaintiff managed post-secondary programs with an annual budget of $960,000, taught upgrading and university entrance courses, and supervised other teaching and support staff. In 1996 an education board was established and given the task of overseeing the administration of the education complex and its teaching programs. There was overlap between the plaintiff and the board's mandate and functions that led to conflict. The board suspended the plaintiff for 10 days during which time it intended to investigate the plaintiff's conduct. The suspension continued and the board later passed a resolution formally terminating the plaintiff's employment. The plaintiff sued for wrongful dismissal. The defendant contended it dismissed the plaintiff with cause. HELD: The plaintiff was wrongfully dismissed. The court ruled that the employer had to provide evidence demonstrating serious employee misconduct. There was no such evidence produced by the defendant, and it was not enough simply to show a loss of confidence in the plaintiff or dissatisfaction with his job performance. The plaintiff's damages were limited to being paid out the end of his term contract. Punitive and aggravated damages were not allowed. Although the plaintiff had been treated unfairly, the plaintiff had not shown that the employer was guilty of harsh, vindictive, reprehensible and malicious conduct.","The plaintiff sought damages for wrongful dismissal and damages for breach of contract and insubordination. HELD: The plaintiff was dismissed from his position as co-ordinator of post secondary education programs in May 1997. He was awarded his taxable costs of the proceeding including all necessary disbursements reasonably incurred. 1)The plaintiff had been employed from year to year as a guidance counsellor for the education complex. His employment was terminated in the summer of 1996 when he was terminated by the chief and band council. He remained in that position until May 1997, when he remained for ten days without pay. His damages were limited to $12,394.22 and pre-judgment interest were calculated in accordance with the Prejudgment Interest Act. 2)There was no evidence that some members of the board created an environment that made it impossible for the plaintiff to perform his duties to their satisfaction. It was as though they were determined to see him gone and set about to find a way that he, who was treated unfairly and wrongfully dismissed, could not be found guilty."
e_2006skqb446.txt,"The respondent father is part of farming partnership with two brothers and two cousins running mixed grain and cattle operation. Division of the matrimonial property is at issue. The issues include what amounts, if any, are to be added to the sources of income set out in the father's total income in his T1 General form to come to the appropriate level of income for the purpose of calculating child maintenance payments. HELD: 1) The father's income has fluctuated significantly in the last years, and the inherent nature of farming is such that it is more appropriate in the circumstances to this operation to use year average. 2) Non-arm's length salary will be added back into income unless the father established that payments were necessary and reasonable. In 2004 the amount of salary paid to the mother for bookkeeping was $5,000. It would appear that the $15,000 paid in 2003 was means of splitting income. $5,000 appears to be reasonable amount. 3) Some of the personal expenses claimed as farm expenses such as electricity, home heat, telephone, meals and office expenses should be added back to income. The father has added back portion of these expenses based on certain percentages being allocated to personal use. It has not been established that more amounts need to be added back. 4) The majority of the capital cost allowance on personal property owned by the father relates to his motor vehicle. He states the personal use of his truck is 10%. The full amount claimed for capital cost allowance is not necessary for the replacement of the vehicle. This along with significant personal use of the vehicle makes it reasonable to add back 50% of the capital cost allowance claimed in each of the years in question. 5) The mother has asked that the Court add back to the father's personal income the amounts claimed in the partnership and then allocated to the individual partners. The father's income tax return includes personal farm component which consists of much smaller income and expense statement on matters that are totally within his control and for which all benefits accrue to him. His tax return also includes the partnership statement which shows the same types of income and expenses but on partnership basis. There are five partners involved, two are his brothers and the other two are his cousins. There is no evidence to suggest that the income statements of the partnership are fashioned in such way to reflect an inaccurate picture on cash basis of the operation of the farm partnership. There is nothing to suggest that the partnership is organizing its expenses or distribution to artificially lower the income of the father. This is not situation where the father is the sole shareholder in corporation. This is not situation in which there is majority ownership in the partnership which would allow the father to control the activities of income distribution or asset purchase. There is nothing in the Guidelines to suggest that the Court should be adding back any of the partnership amounts to the income of the father automatically. There is nothing in the evidence that would lead the Court to the conclusion capital cost allowance being claimed by partnership is inappropriate or indeed that any of the expenses or accounting functions used by the partnership do not reflect the partnership business over the long term. The Court was not prepared to add back to the income of the father the personal expenses claimed in partnership returns as farm expenses, capital cost allowance on real property or personal property owned by the partnership. 6) The total income averaged over 3 years comes to $29,983 each year. Child maintenance shall be paid on that amount.","The parties met, married, made children and then separated. The respondent father is part of a farming partnership with two brothers and two cousins. They have not settled a division of matrimonial property. Issues [1] What amounts, if any, are to be added to the sources of income set out in the father's total income in his T1 General form to come to the appropriate level of income for the purpose of calculating child maintenance? HELD: 1) The respondent's income is $29,983 and he shall pay to the petitioner for the support of Reidar and Bronwyn Knudson, born December 1998. The father shall be responsible for 56 percent of the s. expenses which consist of non-subsidized childcare and any health and medical costs in excess of $100 per annum. The petitioner and the respondent are ordered to provide the other with copies of their income tax returns, including all schedules and partnership statements, no later than June 15, 2007 and by the same date in each year thereafter.  2) The case law which focuses on the reasonableness of the expense as it relates to capital cost allowance and alleged personal expenses claimed on partnership returns acknowledges these are legitimate expenses used to reduce income unless it is shown they are unnecessary or unreasonable. There is nothing to suggest the partnership is organizing its expenses or distribution to artificially lower the income of the father. This is not a situation where there is a majority ownership in the partnership which would allow the father to control the activities of income distribution or asset purchase. It appears to me that the holding of trial, in fact, was more efficient and cheaper method of coming to conclusion regarding the issue of maintenance than ongoing negotiation or pre-trial. Each party achieved partial success in their approach.  3) Each party will be in a small credit position which he can offset against ongoing maintenance but in amount no greater than $50 per month so as not to cause any inappropriate financial hardship on the children."

The issue here was responsibility for the legal costs incurred by the plaintiff to compel production. Her solicitor/client bill exceeded $50,000 including very large disbursements as a trustee was appointed to preserve the property and the defendant solicitor's files were seized. An accountant then prepared what amounted to a forensic audit.HELD: The court was able to withdraw from further intervention. Additional information could be obtained through the normal discovery process.  1)The contempt was not as blatant as first appeared. Part of his failure to produce documentation arose from the sorry state of his records and proper identification of assets was due in part to production orders against third parties. 2)The defendant solicitor ought to pay the solicitor/client costs because he caused the expense of pre-trial production by his stalling tactics. However the appropriate route in the circumstances was to leave costs to the trial judge. It may be that the plaintiff was indebted to the solicitor at the time of the contempt which would not excuse his failure to comply with the court order but may influence the matter of costs. It may also be that the legal costs incurred to enforce production were out of proportion to any gain the plaintiff could have expected.","FIAT. The defendant was in contempt of court orders requiring him to account to the plaintiff for her trust funds. A trustee was appointed, and the files of Bawolin were seized. Then an accountant prepared a forensic audit. All of this was very expensive. HELD: 1)The defendant was ordered to pay the solicitor/client costs taxed. Even if Siemens was substantially unsuccessful at trial in her allegations of wrongdoing byBawolin, still he ought to pay these costs because he caused the expense of the pre-trial production by his stalling tactics. 2)The more appropriate route was to leave the decision to the trial judge. When all the evidence was in, it may transpire that Siemens is in fact, indebted to Bawol as he now says, at the time of the contempt. Such a turn of events would not excuse his disobedience of the court orders, but it might influence the judge on the matter of costs. 3)The judge concluded that the legal costs incurred by Siemens to enforce production were out of proportion to any gain Siemens could have expected to achieve in the company's history. 4)The court was satisfied that the defendant's contempt for the plaintiff arose from the sorry state of his records. The contempt had been purged sufficiently to permit the Court to withdraw from further intervention. Proper identification of assets has resulted largely through production orders against third parties, but also, through belated efforts by Bawoline. Additional information demanded by the defendant can be obtained through the normal discovery process. 5)Solicitor/client fees were taxed."
8_2013skqb397.txt,"HELD: The Court dismissed the application. It held that although it had concurrent jurisdiction with the Federal Court regarding habeas corpus applications, it declined jurisdiction in this case to grant a remedy because habeas corpus could not be used to review a decision of CSC made within the confines of its jurisdiction. The applicants were trying to use habeas corpus when they actually were seeking a writ of certiorari, prohibition or mandamus. These remedies were available only through the Federal Court.","The applicants have brought an application for writ of habeas corpus with certiorari in aid, seeking unconditional release from the Riverbend Minimum Institution due to a threat to their respective liberties claiming the Correctional Service of Canada has violated their rights under the Charter of Rights and Freedoms in not allowing them to reside in a common housing unit so that they can participate in their long-standing, same-sex relationship outside of the public domain. HELD: The application is dismissed. 1) The applicants should have followed the grievance process on the issue of housing assignments. It was obvious from the evidence the Court received concerning the applicants' physical and mental health and the Court's observations of Sinobert during the application that he was suffering from some kind of disability. These remedies fall within the exclusive jurisdiction of the Federal Court of Canada through a judicial review process. 2) The Court's jurisdiction to grant remedies against federal institutions and decision makers is narrow. It is not for this Court to determine the reasonableness of the administrative decisions made by the Correctional Services of Canada within the confines of its jurisdiction. Habeas corpus cannot be used to review the decision of the RCMP declining a housing reassignment request or the policy that all inmates found in a housing unit other than their own will be subject to disciplinary charges. The true character of the remedies being sought by the applicants is a writ of certioraris, prohibition or mandamus and these remedies fall outside the Exclusive jurisdiction of The Federal Court in a judicial process through which the Court has concluded that it must decline its jurisdiction in such a fashion as to grant a remedy on the application guised as a habas corpus application.  3) In the unique circumstances of this case, with the consent of both parties and the respondent not really taking issue with the applicant's request, the Court allowed the applicant to make submissions on his behalf as well as his own. That proved to be beneficial for everyone as towards the end of the argument both inmates continued to be housed in separate living units, neither having had their security levels reclassified and neither having filed a first-level grievance."

The respondent sought to have the separation agreement set aside on the grounds of duress, undue influence or unconscionsability. The couple had a traditional marriage. The petitioner earned $48,000 per year. The wife did not work outside the home and suffered from severe arthritis. For the petitioner and incorporating into the agreement an added provision addressing the respondent's need for drug coverage, that there was nothing unduly harsh about the agreement which would justify setting it aside. The evidence indicated that the respondent had received independent legal advice and she did not establish that she had been dominated by the petitioner to the extent that her signature would have been induced by undue influence or duress. The court determined that the respondent would be far worse off if the agreement was set aside and an equal division ordered.",The parties entered into a separation agreement for the purpose of increasing the maintenance provision and retaining the asset division. The husband argued that the agreement should be set aside as a whole or in part under s. 29 of the Matrimonial Property Act; in dealing with maintenance under the Divorce Act; the wife sought an order setting aside the separation agreement so that she could retain the matrimonial home with an equal division of the net proceeds if it were to be sold in the future; the maintenance award was of such a low amount that it was unconscionable and harsh to bind the wife to such a agreement.
7_1995canlii5894.txt,"The Defendants applied to sever the issues of liability and damages for purposes of the trial of this matter. The trial was to be held before a jury.HELD: 1)The Court has a general discretion as to severance of issues which must be exercised judicially. 2)Severance should only be ordered when the judge has a serious reason to believe that the trial of the issue proposed to be severed will put an end to the action. 3)The Court accepted the Plaintiff's submission that expert medical evidence would be necessary to establish the cause of the accident since the Plaintiff had suffered brain damage and would be unable to testify. This medical evidence would have to be repeated to establish the Plaintiff's damages if the issues were severed and liability was found. 4)The severance of the issues would deny the Plaintiff the right to have the jury determine his damages. A jury cannot be disassembled and then recalled to conclude the trial of the remaining issues. 5)The Court was of the view that there should be compelling reasons before issues should be severed for trial, but that no compelling reason had been established in this case.","This was an application by the defendant for an order pursuant to the Court's inherent jurisdiction severing the issues of liability and damages. The defendant argued that a trial of liability would be unnecessary given the quantum of damages claimed by the plaintiffs and given the volume of evidence necessary to prove the aspect of the claim, the prior determination of liability may result in a very significant reduction in trial time and costs. HELD: The application for severance of the issues should only be granted for the most compelling reasons and in cases in which it is probable that the trial of one issue will put an end to the action. Liability was in issue. The plaintiffs had served demand that the issue of liability be heard by a jury. The judge must have some evidence which will make it at least probable that an action will take place. This evidence will be relevant to the cause as well as the degree of injuries sustained.  1)An application to sever the issues would require an examination of the injuries and how they were sustained. Such evidence would be required to establish the origin and cause of the causation of the accident. 2)The plaintiff was not to be harassed at the instance of the defendant by series of trials, each trial taking issue on every link of the plaintiff's case.  3)A jury, whether discharged or not, can be reconstituted some time later to carry on with the second part of the trial. Such a trial will not result in any significant delay in the overall management of the case."
8_2008nssc358.txt,"The corollary relief judgment provided that the parties would share parenting of their two children approximately equally. Child support would be based on the difference between what each party would otherwise have paid if the shared custody arrangement had not been in effect. The wife now applied to have the amount paid by the husband increased due to his increase in income and a decline in her income. Following the divorce, the wife had opened her own business which only produced negligible income and in each of the past four years, she had withdrawn between $10,000 and $14,000 from her RRSP, which amounts she argued should be not considered when calculating her contribution to the children's support. She also sought to have the court go back to when the parties first separated to have the husband pay any deficiency which the court might find. The husband requested that the court impute income to the wife on the basis that she was intentionally underemployed by continuing to operate a business that failed to produce a reasonable level of income. Application granted in part; monthly amount of child support payable by the husband is increased based on his increased income; the wife's RRSP income was considered in the calculation of child support as it had been a recurring income figure over the past four years; no income imputed to the wife but if she could not draw a reasonable level of income from the business within the next year, it would be open to the court to reconsider this issue. Given that the previous variation order was a consent order and both parties had legal counsel at the time and had not appealed that order, the court was not prepared to retroactively vary its terms.","The applicant sought to vary the child support terms of the Corollary Relief Judgment. The parties had an agreement that they would share joint custody of their two children and share parenting of the children approximately equally. The respondent now sought to again increase the level of child support based on the former wife's increased income and a decline in her income. The former wife operated her own business which produced negligible income. She asked the court to review the way the parties' income was calculated, including spousal support and child support payments, to reduce the amount based on undue hardship. The applicant argued that her RRSP income should not be considered when calculating her contribution to the children's support. In 2006 her income for child support purposes was $10,874.28, requiring child support payment of only $97.00 per month. In 2007 that figure was adjusted by the $500 gross up of his dividends and $481.04 for professional fees leaving him with a total income figure of $144,363.27 which would require a shared custody arrangement of two children of $1,850. The ex-wife owned a business and earned a modest income; she relied on this income as part of her household revenue. She claimed she was limited in what she could do and yet put long hours into her business and apparently travelled a great deal as result. She sought to have the respondent ordered to pay more child support, arguing that if the company was not profitable it would be time for the respondent to get a'real job' even if it was a part-time position. Costs were to be paid within 60 days of the order being granted pursuant to the Variation Order, plus or minus any adjustments as appropriate to the Child Support Guidelines."

The evidence did not support a conclusion that the applicant aided or abetted the accused in committing the offence charged."
2010skpc153.txt,"The accused was charged with angling without a license, applying for a license when prohibited and possessing fish without a license contrary to various sections of The Fisheries Act and The Fisheries Regulations. The accused raised a Charter defence arguing that section 35 of The Fisheries Act was unconstitutional. The issue for the trial judge was whether there was a valid ministerial order revoking the accused's license and prohibiting him from applying for or obtaining a fishing license. A conservation officer had attempted to serve the accused with a copy of letter signed by an unknown person on behalf of the Acting Executive Director, Fish and Wildlife Branch. The letter purported to advise the accused that due to a previous conviction his current fishing license was revoked and he was prohibited from obtaining another one. The letter referenced a prohibition under s. 13(4) of The Fisheries Regulations. The conversation officer testified that he opened the door of a house that he thought belonged to the accused and left the letter on a stand near the door. The conservation officer was unable to say if the occupant heard him say anything about a license suspension or whether anyone in the house saw him place the envelope on the stand inside the door. HELD: Section 27 of The Fisheries Act (Saskatchewan) does not give the minister the power to revoke the a license when a person contravenes the The Fisheries Regulations. Further, the Acting Executive Director, Fish and Wildlife Branch is not a member of Executive Council as required by the definition of 'Minister' in the Act. The letter was signed by an unknown person who clearly did not meet the definition of 'Minister.' Finally, the letter was not served on the accused personally or via registered mail. There was no prohibition order in effect within the meaning of section 27 of The Fisheries Act. The accused was acquitted of all three counts. It was unnecessary to decide the constitutional issue.","The accused was charged with operating a motor vehicle without a licence contrary to s. 11(1) of the Fisheries Regulations and possession of fish except in accordance with s. 13 of the Act. At the close of the Crown's Charter application, defence brought a Charter application challenging the constitutionality of s. 35 of The Fisheries Act, 1994. HELD: The Court dismissed the application. There was no prohibition order in effect within the meaning of section 27. The Act does not give the accused that power. Exhibit P1 is not a document valid on its face. It purports to revoke Mr. Paulsen’s licence and prohibit him from applying for or obtaining a licence because of a specific conviction. It is signed by an unknown person. This is not collateral attack on a ministerial order, valid on it face and is void ab initio, having been made without authority."

b_2009skca133.txt,"The issues on appeal are whether the parties' children, who were over the age of 18, had withdrawn from the father's charge and were no longer children of the marriage within the meaning of the Divorce Act and therefore disentitled to maintenance after September 2006 when they attended post-secondary education and whether the maintenance paid in the past by the father was sufficient and appropriate. HELD: Appeal allowed. The trial judge made no palpable and overriding error in his finding that the father was not in arrears of maintenance and that there would be no order for retroactive child support. Nevertheless, the trial judge was in error in determining that the children were no longer children of the marriage within the meaning of the Act. The matter is remitted to the trial judge to determine the extent to which the father is obligated to pay maintenance for the children after September 2006.  1) The father and daughters did not have a conventional relationship. The father separated from the mother and daughters early and, since he lived in Hong Kong, could only have a long-distance relationship. The relationship deteriorated in 2006. It would be accurate to describe the daughters as treating their father with disdain. However, this does not necessarily mean that the daughters had withdrawn from the relationship with the father unilaterally. The father could have stayed in contact with the daughters despite the litigation and their failure to provide him with academic records. The father's efforts to contact the daughters were no greater than the daughters' to contact him. The father recognized the financial dependency of the daughters. Their dependency did not end because of the lack of communication. 2) The trial judge placed too much emphasis on the daughters' poor treatment and disdain of the father. His finding that the daughters did not wish to maintain a meaningful relationship with the father misapprehends the evidence respecting the historical and ongoing nature of their relationship. The fact that the emphasis of the relationship after 2003 shifted does not imply that they had no meaningful relationship in their own way. The proper conclusion to be drawn from all the evidence of the relationship before September 2006 and the relative silence after that time is that father and daughters were fighting and this mutual fight was prolonged and sustained by the litigation and the intervention of the mother. This does not mean that they had withdrawn from the relationship with him unilaterally. The high threshold for a finding that it disentitles the daughters to maintenance has not been met.","In January 2007, the mother applied to vary the father's maintenance for her daughters, Nicole and Kirsti. She also applied for determination that the father was in arrears of maintenance and that he provide to her years of retroactive child support. This appeal was about whether the daughters were still dependent within the meaning of the Divorce Act, whether the father had withdrawn from the charge and whether they were still entitled to maintenance after September 2006 when they attended post-secondary education. HELD: The appeal was allowed. The trial judge placed too much emphasis on the daughters' poor treatment and disdain of the father and his finding that the daughters did not wish to maintain a meaningful relationship with him and thus were no longer entitled to support. The fact that the emphasis of the relationship after 2003 shifted does not imply that they had no meaningful relationship in their own way. The quality of the parent/child relationship rarely stands alone as the sole ground for denying support unless the situation is extremely grave. Even if the circumstances as a whole were construed as a unilateral withdrawal by the daughters, the high threshold for a finding that it disentitles the daughters to maintenance has been set."
d_2018skpc6.txt,"HELD: On the basis of the evidence presented by the parties’ experts and in absence of an express term in the contract, the court read in an implied term that the parties agreed to pay a fair and reasonable price and awarded the plaintiff such portion of the amount sought as was fair and reasonable. The plaintiff did not provide a sufficient evidentiary foundation to establish estoppel by convention as it did not tender the invoices that were paid. Even if such evidence had been led, there was no convincing evidence of detrimental reliance as the plaintiff presented no evidence that it would have turned to alternative and more lucrative work.","Reliable Truck Trailer Inc. is a mobile vehicle and associated equipment repair company situated in Pense, Saskatchewan. In 2015 it entered into an oral agreement with Super Save, Inc., hereafter referred to as 'Super Save', in which it agreed to provide, on 'call out', repair services for Super Save. In the relationship, the defendant paid Reliable's invoices as they were presented, but ceased to pay as they became due. Reliable was not prepared to accept the lesser amount and it now brings this action to recover the amount that it says is due. HELD: A fair and reasonable price to be paid for the goods and services provided by the plaintiff to the defendant. 1) In businesses such as the plaintiff's, the industry anticipates that either travel time to and from the work location is regularly billed and paid for, or alternatively, that minimum period of time is charged to its detriment. The defendant properly points out that this trial had to be adjourned on one occasion because the plaintiff had not adequately prepared, and that it has incurred the cost of having his expert attend not once but twice. 2) The plaintiff has received some but not nearly all of the money that was sought, but the defendant has been successful in reducing the amount of money sought. The plaintiff asks that the Court grant it out of pocket expenses that it incurred in having to retain an expert to give evidence on the issue of a reasonable price. 3) There is no evidence of detriment reliance. It is clear that prior to November of 2015, the parties did not take issue with the defendant's charges. Some of these charges were negotiated, reduced, and paid, and others were simply left unpaid without explanation. The Court is unable to determine how long the supposed 'convention' of paying these assorted costs occurred. 4) In the absence of an express term in a contract, as determined by the parties, the terms of the agreement as posited by the defendant, were being used to the effect that the parties agreed that prices were within the confines of an agreement that they entered at the agreed price. It was only in November that the defendants felt that they were being charged too much. In so doing, the party has suffered detriment, such that it would be unfair or unjust to allow one of the parties to resile or depart from the common assumption. As it has been agreed between the parties that the sum of 8,614.17 was paid, there remains due and payable prejudgment interest of $2,288.15."
c_1996canlii5370.txt,"This was an application by the defendants to set aside a default judgment entered against them by the plaintiff. Although a statement of claim was served on the defendant, it's insurer was advised by the plaintiff's counsel that she would not proceed to judgment except on 10 days written notice. More than six months later plaintiff's counsel sent a letter to the defendant's insurer giving 10 days notice. This letter was not seen by him although he was in the process of putting together material for a solicitor to file a defence. The defendant had always advised the plaintiff that it intended to defend. No Notice of Intention, required for default judgment if six or more months had elapsed since the last step in the proceeding, was ever given to the defendant before the filing of the default judgment. Allowing the application and setting aside the default judgment, that there was a fairly arguable defence and a reasonable excuse on the part of the defendant for not filing the defence. Sending a letter to the insurer does not satisfy the requirement of filing a Notice of Intention to proceed. The fact that the prothonotary did not object to the request for default judgment without the Notice is immaterial.","This was an application for an order setting aside a default judgment entered against the defendant town in February 1996.

When the default judgment was entered into, the plaintiff applied to set aside the judgment on the basis that there had not been any notice of intent to proceed filed prior to the default. The applicant argued that the plaintiff should have taken the matter to court to seek default judgment. Dismissing the application, that there was a fairly arguable defence and a reasonable excuse for not filing the defence. In this case, the defendant did not have the jurisdiction to sign the order for default. Even if the Court found the position of the defendant met the test under Rule 12.06, setting aside the default judgement would be a meaningless and costly exercise."
6_2010skqb51.txt,"The Bankrupt applies for his discharge from bankruptcy. The discharge is opposed by the Credit Union and the trustee. The Bankrupt was a cattle farmer. He financed this undertaking principally through the Credit Union. HELD: The Bankrupt will be discharged conditional upon payment of $8,000 in addition to surplus income of $2,250 to his estate for the benefit of his creditors. He should be able to comply with this order within 3 years.  1) The bankrupt is 42 years old and a first time bankrupt. He is employed with an excavating company and earns $20 an hour and works as much as 160 hours per week. He is paying $1,000 per month on his mortgage and is trying to catch up on mortgage arrears to stave off foreclosure. He is working hard and living a subsistence life. However, he still has some funds left with an income level above the Superintendent's Standard for a family of two. 2) His assets are less than $.50 on the dollar. His creditors were put to the unnecessary expense by his frivolous or vexatious defence of their claim and he failed to comply with the duties of a bankrupt by failing to produce proper records and assist the trustee to the fullest. He has been abusive and disrespectful throughout.","The bankrupt applied for his discharge from bankruptcy under s.172(2) of the Bankruptcy and Insolvency Act. His assets were $171,255 (mostly exempt or encumbered) against unsecured debts totalling $433,750 and secured debt of $150,000. His statement of affairs showed that he had $50,000 in assets at the time of his assignment, but that amount was reduced to $8,000 as a result of the combined forces of drought and BSE. The bankrupt argued that he purchased cattle for $1,000 per head prior to bankruptcy but could only sell them at his expense. He alleged that he sold cattle post-bankruptcy to save his farm. SCU brought an application to compel the bankrupt to consent to judgment on s.173(1)(a) and sought payment of the cost award of $12,000 coupled with a conditional order of consent of half of their judgment. The bankruptcy judge was unable to grant the bankrupt an absolute discharge on these grounds as the bankrupt was a resourceful, hard working person and he was entitled to earn off-farm income. He should be able to comply with the conditional order within three years which is considered an acceptable period of time for a bankrupt to be burdened with such a condition."
e_2008skca94.txt,"This appeal was brought on a narrow ground from a judgment in the Court of Queen's Bench granting variation of a child support order pursuant to s. 17(1) of the Divorce Act. The appeal challenged the chambers judge's interpretation and application of s. 7(1.1) of the Federal Child Support Guidelines, which defines the term 'extraordinary expenses.' The appellant argued that the chambers judge erred in ordering the appellant to contribute proportionately to the costs associated with the children's extracurricular activities without finding that these were 'extraordinary expenses' within the meaning of the Guidelines. The appellant argued these expenses were ordinary and not extraordinary within the meaning of s. 7(1)(d) and (f) and s. 7(1.1) of the Guidelines. It was the appellant's position that these expenses were covered by the basic child support order which the respondent received tax free, in addition to the appellant's responsibility for 73% of the children's health care and day care expenses. HELD: Appeal dismissed with costs to the respondent. Per Hunter J.A. (Gerwing J.A. concurring): All the information needed to determine the s. 7(1)(f) expenses eligible for proportionate sharing was before the Chambers judge: he knew the total income of the recipient spouse; he knew the previous extracurricular activities and the 11 current extracurricular activities that the children participated in, along with the estimated annual cost. Updated financial statements were filed by both the appellant and respondent. The Chambers judge exercised his discretion and granted an order requiring the appellant to pay his proportionate share (73%) of the extracurricular activities he listed, which is approximately one-half of the children's extracurricular activities. Accordingly, he did not make a palpable and overriding error, nor did he err in law, and his conclusion is supported by the evidence before him on this application. There is no basis to interfere with the decision of the Chambers judge. Per Smith J.A. (in dissent): Significant deference must be given by this Court to the chambers judge in relation to child support orders. This is particularly so to the extent that such orders involve the exercise of discretion. In this case the trial judge erred in law in failing to consider and apply the definition of 'special or extraordinary expenses' in s. 7(1.1) of the Guidelines. First, it is impossible without some evidence, explanation or explicit finding, to understand why even the total of all the children's extracurricular activities would be considered 'extraordinary' in the statutory sense, given the level of child support ordered and the respondent's annual income. There was simply no evidence to support such conclusion. Second, the order did not, in fact, come close to ordering that the appellant pay proportion of half the activities, since it excluded the cost of music lessons for the two older children. In addition, it included the cost of Tae Kwon Do for which there was no evidence at all. In short, such an interpretation lacks any rational basis. Third, it is clear that, up until the argument on the appeal, the parties themselves had interpreted the order more generally, as an order that the appellant pay proportion of all the children's extra-curricular activities. This interpretation certainly makes more sense, for the alternative would require variation in the order, or new agreement, every time the children changed or added activities. It is unlikely that the chambers judge would have confined his order so specifically, absent, of course, an agreement of the parties, or reasonable finding that specific activity constituted an extraordinary expense. The chambers judge erred in failing to consider the definition of extraordinary expenses in s. 7(1.1), or this Court's decision in Ryba v. Schoenroth, and acted without any evidence that the expenses in question constituted extraordinary expenses within the meaning of the Guidelines. Accordingly, the appeal is allowed and the order of the chambers judge that the appellant pay proportion of the children's extracurricular activities is set aside. The appellant should have the costs of the appeal.","This was an appeal from a Queen's Bench decision allowing this appeal and setting aside the order of the Chambers judge on the basis that he acted without any evidence that certain activities of the children were extraordinary expenses within the meaning of the Federal Child Support Guidelines and that he failed to consider and apply the definition of'special and extraordinary expenses' in s. 7(1.1) of the Guidelines. HELD: Appeal dismissed.  1) It is implicit in the conclusion that he found that approximately one-half of the appellant's extracurricular activities were found to be extraordinary. He also addressed the question of the respondent's income and the cost of Tae Kwon Do for which there was no evidence at all.  2) The chambers judge had the necessary evidence before him that he is required to consider to make his decision whether all, some, or none of the expenses are extraordinary. The expenses are covered by the basic child support order of $2,532 per year, which the respondent receives tax free. There is no basis to interfere with the decision of the Chamber judge."
c_2002skqb508.txt,"A motion for judicial review of a Labour Relations Board decision awarding a retroactive wage increase to employees. The food services operators, alleging a denial of natural justice and procedural fairness, sought to have the orders set aside on the grounds the decisions were patently unreasonable in that the employer could not afford the wage increases and because retroactivity would not have been a feature of a replicated contract. HELD: The motion was dismissed.  1)In undertaking to replicate a collective bargaining agreement that the parties might have reached, the LRB concluded the contract in 14 months by which time the two year term contract had only three and one-half months to go. The two year contract has now expired and the business has been sold. To elevate this issue to a point where a rehearing would be required would seem counterproductive. 2)The LRB's actions fell well short of substantial compliance with the 45 day limit for review. However at no time was the 'over 45 days' issue raised in the proceedings before the Board. The test of 'substantial compliance' would involve a consideration of the purpose of the 45 day time limit and the probability of prejudice which might arise from a failure to comply. The importance of a retroactive wage increase, which was substantial if viewed as a percentage, would seem prejudicial, even accepting the 45 day limit is directory. The employer sought and obtained an adjournment of the hearing in April which effectively made compliance with the 45 day limit impossible as the employees left once they graduated from their university courses. 3)The errors were not so severe or so obvious as to meet the standard of patently unreasonable as defined by the courts (ie. clearly irrational (Federal Court of Appeal), outrageous, absurd, ridiculous, so beyond the bound of reason as to amount to fraud on the law or deliberate refusal to comply with it (Southam)). 4)The decision to allow employees, who had graduated and left their employment to receive back pay, was not of sufficient import to justify a finding of breach of natural justice. Whether the Board breached natural justice and procedural fairness by awarding retroactive wages depends on whether the issue was one of the points of dispute between the parties. To set aside the entire process because the retroactivity issue was not front and centre in the preliminary discussions would seem contrary to reason and curial deference. Had the raise in pay not been retroactive it would, in light of the late decision, been rather meaningless.","The Saskatchewan Labour Relations Board awarded a wage increase to employees of Four Star Management Ltd., operators of certain food services at the University of Saskatchewan. The wage increase was part of first collective bargaining agreement concluded by the Board after the normal bargaining between the parties had failed. The employer had advised the Board that it was not 'prepared to make the agreement retroactive'. HELD: The motion was dismissed. 1) The employer was a merchant. His products were priced in such a way as to reflect in part the labour costs involved in delivering them to the public. 2) The Board denied the parties natural justice and procedural fairness in respect of the wage retroactivity to employees who had left the employ before the contract was concluded by order of the Board. It is argued that the right to conclude first contract was limited to the 45 day period and that, with respect to those who had remained in the employ prior to the Board's order, the wage increase would not have been of sufficient import to justify a breach of natural justice. 3) The Court did not find that the errors made here were so severe as to meet the standard of patently unreasonable as defined by the Courts."

If Parliament had intended a narrow application of s. 490.013(2.1), it would have used the same language as it did in s. 490.012(3).

8_2006skqb274.txt,"DIGEST The appellants were convicted of several offences pursuant to the Health of Animals Act and Regulations resulting from their handling of elk and from obstructing inspectors. The total sentence imposed by the trial judge was $69,000. HELD: 1) The sentencing judge was aware that the appellants had been previously convicted in 1990 of transporting wildlife without the prescribed documents. The sentencing judge determined that the fines must be sufficient to deter the appellants and the general public. The sentencing judge was also aware that the appellants are leaders in the elk industry. This is a factor that would require a sufficient fine to set an example for others in the industry and within the appellants' community.  2) In this case of fifteen convictions, the maximum fines prescribed are $750,000. The total fine of $69,000 for placing elk in danger and for obstructing inspectors cannot be considered disproportionately high. Given the need for the sentencing judge to address deterrence in a public welfare statute, the court could not find the sentence was 'demonstrably unfit'. Oppositely, it is both appropriate and fit. 3) Other than varying the default provisions to the statutory default times outlined in s. 734(8) of the Criminal Code, this appeal is dismissed.","The appellants were convicted by a Queen's Bench trial judge of several offences pursuant to the Health of Animals Act and the Health Of Animals Regulations resulting from their handling of elk and obstructing inspectors.

Given the need for the sentencing judge to address deterrence in a public welfare statute, the sentence was 'demonstrably unfit' to the point that it was both appropriate and fit. 2)Other than varying the default provisions to the statutory default times outlined in s.734(8) of the Criminal Code, this appeal is dismissed."
b_2004skqb156.txt,"The appellant appeals the calculation of his income replacement benefit made by the respondent, SGI, as provided by Part VIII of The Automobile Accident Insurance Act. Under s. 198 of the Act, a hearing was held to determine certain facts. The parties agree the appellant was a non-earner as defined by the Act, who was involved in a motor vehicle accident and suffered injuries to an extent that he is not able to carry on gainful employment as a skidder operator. The appellant estimated that he should receive an income replacement benefit (IRB) based on yearly wages in excess of $50,000. This position was based on employment promised to the appellant that would have started during the first 180 days following the accident. The respondent submits that the weighted average approach sets the IRB much lower, as in the previous 3 years the appellant earned no more than $12,000 per year. HELD: 1) The IRB must reflect a claimant's earning reality. The appellant's earning reality was far from the promised employment. The Court found that the appellant's earning reality was working for employment income no more than half the time and the IRB ought to be calculated accordingly.  2) The benefits referred to in s. 20 of the Regulations include employment bonuses, tips, overtime, and personal use of a motor vehicle. There is no requirement to include employment insurance benefits in the calculation required for s. 24(1) of the Regulations. 3) Counsel for the appellant was entitled to solicitor-client costs as provided by s. 198(5) of the Act and Regulation 101.","The appellant appeals the calculation of his income replacement benefit made by the respondent, SGI, as provided by Part VIII of the Automobile Accident Insurance Act.

Working for CLC Logging Ltd. amounted to wage rate of $16 per hour for a six-week period averaging 34.25 hours. The average work week was 34.75 hours. 3) SGI submits that the weighted average approach in calculating the IRB set the respondent's gross yearly employment income at the time of the accident is much lower than that used for employment insurance benefits. The ratio in Dietner is not relevant. Section 117 and the corresponding regulations provide the mathematical formula to determine Montgrand's IRB and the GYEI from which it is derived. 4) The Court accepts Cowan's evidence that his operation continues in inclement weather.

6_2009nssc387.txt,"The divorcing parties disagreed about whether the wife's son from a previous relationship (now 13) was a 'child of the marriage.' While they lived together for seven years and had one child together, they were married for less than a year. The wife alleged the husband had stood in the place of a parent to the child. She claimed this was evidenced by the fact that: he started acting like a dad before the parties lived together (when the child was two); he was involved in things like medical appointments and school activities; the child's biological father only recently became involved; and they had discussed adoption early in the relationship. The evidence showed the decision to allow the child's biological father to assume an increasing role in his life was made solely by the wife. The child no longer had contact with the husband. The child is not a 'child of the marriage.' The husband did not stand in the place of a parent to him. He was a big part of the child's life but his role was mostly incidental to the relationship with the wife and a normal part of living with a child. The marriage was short and the father's parenting role was diminished before the marriage (by the mother's choice to allow the biological father back into the child's life, and the parties' failure to pursue the idea of adoption that was raised early on). Applying the Supreme Court's decision in Cook (2000), the threshold for finding parental status is high and reserved for cases where a person can clearly be shown to have assumed a parental role in substantial substitution for the biological parent. Such is not the case here.","The issue for the Court was whether Tristen was a child of the marriage as defined by the Divorce Act (and, if so, what his obligation to pay child support should be). The parties married in 2001 and separated in 2008. The parenting and support issues concerning the child have been resolved. The child's relationship with his natural father (Mr. Hanna) was diminished before and during the marriage by Ms. Callahan's decision to allow Mr. Hanna back into the child's life. This was an important decision. The respondent did not'stand in the place of a parent' when this decision was made. The threshold for parental status finding is set at a sufficiently high point that it avoids the imposition of obligations and the acquisition of custody rights except where the step-parent can be clearly shown to have assumed the role of the natural parent."
4_2010skqb193.txt,"The litigation revolved around a claim by the plaintiffs for damages that resulted from a motor vehicle accident. The plaintiff alleged damages from injuries in a statement of claim issued in 2006. In 2010, the defendant insurance companies made a demand for particulars seeking production of documents listed in the plaintiff's Statement as to Documents, most of which related to determining the extent of the plaintiffs injury. Counsel for the plaintiff opposed the application and suggested the issues were for discovery.

The defendants may require their own medical examinations by request to the plaintiff or court.  1) There is substantive and legitimate purpose served by the defendants' request for better and current particulars and disclosure of documents. 2) The defendants must know with more particularly, garnered from the passage of time and therapeutic treatment and healing of the plaintiff, the extent of her injury and whether there will be a chronic disability are some of the factors that necessitate the granting of this request. 3) With respect to the plaintiffs' argument to wait for discovery, the defendants are going to be obliged to do their homework and prepare the same particulars in preparation for their own examinations for discovery. These particulars may be meaningful to the defence. The plaintiffs need more than a vague demand to be made. To be able to prepare for discovery in such a fashion as to assist the defendants in their own examination for discovery is not a valid argument.  4) The plaintiffs have demonstrated their frustration with the defendants and their counsel. Twenty-four days has now elapsed. Blame matters not in the court's deliberations other than being possible factor going to the issue of costs of the application. 5) Each of the defendants has furnished a draft order. The draft orders are to issue as an order of the court, save and excepting the request for costs in the cause. It would be premature on the part of the Court to award costs at this stage. The trial judge will be better able to assess the merits of these motions than am able to infer from the material presently before the court."
5_2002skqb378.txt,"All of the parties agreed on February 4, 2002 that the mother and grandmother would have joint custody of the 4 year old. The father was granted reasonable access on reasonable notice. The issue of child support was adjourned sine die with an order that the father provide copies of his income tax returns for the past 3 years. Issues were whether child support should be retroactive; s.7 expenses; costs. HELD: 1)The father was to pay ongoing monthly child support of $293 for so long as the child remains a child within the meaning of the Family Maintenance Act. 2)He was to pay retroactive child support of $1,500 in monthly installments of $100. There must be some justification for retroactive support orders. This Court followed the approach taken by BC Court of Appeal in L.S. v. E.P., which set out the factors a court should consider in granting retroactive child support. He should have paid $335 in 2000; $324 in 2001; $293 in 2002. It was not clear why the petitioner did not seek financial disclosure through the Court. 3)The father was to pay his 59% share of the costs of the music program, gymnastics, swimming and craft camp within 10 days of receiving receipts. There was no prior spending pattern for the court to consider, as the child had no independent needs and was only 3 months old when the parents separated. While illness can qualify as a legitimate reason for requiring child care, the illness must relate to the child's custodian, not to a third party. The preschool expense was reasonable in relation to the total means of the three parties. The $20 kindergarten enrollment expense did not qualify as extraordinary. Retroactive s.7 expenses were not warranted. 4)There was no order for costs as results were mixed.","The issue of child support was adjourned sine die with an order that the respondent father pay ongoing support for his granddaughter of $293 per month. The parties had been unable to reach an agreement regarding child support and had proceeded to trial. The issues before the Court were: 1) whether the child support order should be made retroactive; 2) whether s. 7 expenses met the requirements set out in The Family Maintenance Act; and 3) costs. The child care expenses incurred did not meet these requirements. The respondent father's annual income for child support purposes was $35,269.44 and he voluntarily increased his support payments to $300 per month in 2002. In addition, he was ordered to pay 59% of the costs of his daughter's music program commencing in September 2002 and then December 2002. Allowing the application in part, that a $20 expense for kindergarten cannot meet such a qualification. The expense relating to the pre-school would qualify as extraordinary given the petitioner's limited income."

The receiver manager of the registered owner (the numbered company) under the Bankruptcy Act and the instrument appointed receiver on behalf of the secured creditor and mortgagee (HSBC Bank) applied for a vesting order. The trustee had tried to sell the real property for year. HELD: The vesting order was granted. 1)Although the Court tentatively concluded that s.109 of the new Land Tittles Act, 2000 combined with Queen's Bench Act ss.12 and 65 are not sufficient authority to support the granting of a vesting order in the circumstances, the Court was now satisfied that Regulation 6.5 of the Land Titles Conversion Facilitation Regulation to the new Act does so. In substance the regulation parallels the nature, extent, purpose and intent served by the vesting order provisions contained in the former s.87. 2)This was an appropriate case to grant a vesting order in the absence of adverse interests or any interest in the registered owner or any subsequent encumbrancer or other creditor. The bank's indebtedness secured by its mortgage far exceeded the purchase price. The registered owner had taken no opposition. No other interests will be adversely affected. 3)The reservations expressed in the Clarkson case did not exist or apply to the circumstances here but others having similar interests in future were cautioned to consider the direction of the Court of Appeal at para of its Clarkson judgment.","FIAT. Deloitte & Touche applied for a vesting order under the Bankruptcy and Insolvency Act to register title in favour of the proposed purchaser of the property obtained as a result of a year long effort by the trustee to sell it. The mortgagee, HSBC Bank's indebtedness secured by its mortgage far exceeds the purchase price of the real property. Notice of this application was served upon counsel for the Registered Owner and no opposition on its part has been taken to this application. The application for the vesting orders applied for is granted. The form of the draft order filed with the applicant solicitor's subsequent submissions may issue. Because the Land Titles Conversion Facilitation Regulations, R.R.S. 2000 combined with ss. 12 and 65 of The Queen's Bench Act, 1998, c. L-5.1, and in particular Regulation 6.5 dealing with vestings orders, the jurisdiction formerly granted to the Court by s. 87 of The Land Titlestles Act, 1978 was not brought forward by the new regulations.

2_1999canlii12455.txt,"The primary issue was custody of the four children and dependent upon that determination, the quantum of child support. Matrimonial property owned at the time of separation in 1995 had been divided except for a pension and RSP. The parties agreed to joint custody in 1996 in an interim separation agreement and the father would pay support of $693.80 per month.HELD: 1)The evidence demonstrated a breakdown of the marriage as established by s.8(2)(a) of the Divorce Act. 2)Joint custody was ordered such that the children would reside an equal amount of time in each home, alternating every two weeks. The most important consideration was stability which was to be found in the father's home. Only the best interests of the children must be taken into consideration as determined by the condition, means, needs and other circumstances of the children. 3)The child support payable by the father was reduced by 30 percent. The table amount for four children based on the father's income of $45,900 was $962 per month. The mother's income was below the level at which any support would be payable. Where there is a significant disparity in incomes, a straight set off as suggested in Hubic and Mertler may not be appropriate in all cases. It failed to take into account the father's more modest means and ability to pay the full table amount as well as support for four childen in his care 50 percent of the time. The shared custody arrangement which fell within s.9 of the Federal Child Support Guidelines, did not necessarily lead to a reduction in the amount payable. There was no evidence of increased costs. 4)The parties agreed the registered retirement savings plan and employment pension should be divided equally after liabilities were paid. 5)No costs.","The primary issue between the parties was custody of their four children. Ancillary to and dependent upon the determination of the custody issue, is the quantum of child support that will be payable by either party. HELD: The children were to be in joint custody of the children. Their access to the matrimonial home was largely divided between them to their mutual satisfaction. Their desire to eventually relocate to Alberta to marry a speech language pathologist had resulted in the children residing an equal amount of time in each parent's home. Although their relationship had deteriorated over the years, the children had the most stability and were receiving the most structure and support in their educational endeavours. The uncontradicted evidence of the mother indicated that the most important consideration for the children now was stability. That stability was found in their father's home and they received the most structured and support system in the province. The evidence did not show that a move to Clareshorn, a six hour drive from Saskatoon would have any significant impact on their quality of contract."
c_2016skqb269.txt,"HELD: The court did not accept the Crown’s position that proof of a worker injury or death necessarily proved the actus reus of failing to ensure the health and safety of an employee. The deceased witness’s evidence was not relied upon by the court due to inconsistencies. The assistant manager’s evidence also had some inconsistencies but overall his oral testifying was found to be in a frank and honest manner. The court accepted the assistant manager’s evidence that he would not have told the employee or anyone to go down into the pit to clear a blockage, because it is not possible to clear such a blockage from inside the pit. The Crown argued that, in any event, the court should infer that because the employee entered the pit, the respondent did not adequately instruct, train, supervise and inform him. The court found that the mass of training material emphasized the dangers and the importance of following the safety procedures. The information was not buried in a mass of other information as suggested by the Crown. The court found that the information, training, instruction and supervision was sufficient, if adhered to, to ensure the health and safety of the employee, generally. The Crown argued that a culture of paying lip service to safety had developed at the respondent’s place of business. The court held that, despite some lapses in safety, overall there was a culture of safety. The court also held that the respondent did not instruct the employee to unplug a blockage in the pit and, therefore, did not have an obligation to instruct him on how to perform that task. The respondent was not guilty of counts 1 and 2. The Crown also did not prove the actus reus of counts 3 and 4. The Crown failed to prove that the respondent did not adequately train and supervise the employee with respect to responding to a blockage by looking into the receiving pit to see if it was full of grain. The court also concluded that the respondent had made the employee aware of the hazard of being engulfed in grain in a receiving pit and, therefore, the actus reus of counts 5 and 6 were not proved. The court noted that if the actus reus had been proven with respect to any count, the court would have, nonetheless, concluded that the respondent exercised due diligence.","The deceased was employed at a grain terminal near Rosetown, Saskatchewan. He entered a grain receiving pit in the terminal, where he was engulfed in grain and died of suffocation.

HELD: The deceased was not charged with any of the counts except for the one concerning the deceased. The mass of material emphasized the dangers, and the importance of following the safety procedures, rather than burying them.

c_2011nssc20.txt,"The plaintiffs, Steven and Jody Johansson, were injured in a single vehicle crash while driving with the plaintiff, Mary Johansson. They both received a damage settlement from, and signed releases in favour of, the vehicle's owner and his insurance company ('Citadel'). More than five years later, they brought this action against the car's manufacturer (the defendant, GMCL), claiming the accident was caused by an inherent flaw in the vehicle's design and seeking further damages. GMCL moved for summary judgement on the pleadings in relation to Steven and Jody Johansson, on the basis of the releases. They indicated that, should this matter proceed to trial, they would be joining Citadel as a third party. Motion granted; Steven and Jody Johansson's claims dismissed. There are no genuine issues for trial; the only facts in dispute relate to Mary Johansson. The releases were clear and unambiguous. Although neither plaintiff had the benefit of independent legal advice when signing, they both accepted payment in full and final settlement of any damages arising from the accident. They should not now expect to recover further compensation, especially where pursuing the claim will result in a claim for contribution or indemnity against Citadel. While GMCL was not a party to the release, the release did contemplate third parties being covered insofar as those third parties 'might claim contribution or indemnity'. Both conditions from the SCC case of Fraser River [1999] have been met: the parties to the contract (Citadel and the plaintiffs) intended to extend the benefit in question to the third party seeking to rely on it; and the very activities concerned are those contemplated as coming within the scope of the contract in general. GMCL should be entitled to use the releases to defend the action brought by these plaintiffs. To allow the action to proceed would be an abuse of the court's process.","The defendant moved for summary judgment, dismissing the claims made by two of the plaintiffs, Steven and Jody Johansson, who were injured in a single vehicle accident while passengers in a vehicle driven by the other plaintiff, Maria Johansson.

The parties were encouraged to try to reach agreement on costs. HELD: Both conditions were satisfied and the defendant was entitled to use the Releases to defend against the two plaintiffs who had already been compensated for their injuries by Citadel. To allow their action to proceed would be an abuse of the court's process. The motion for summary judgement was granted and the claims of both Johansson and Johansson were dismissed.

1999skqb29.txt,"In issue was whether the Town Council's proceedings in respect to a proposed hotel development, including the bylaw, were invalid by reason of bad faith and whether it met the statutory prerequisites for a public meeting. HELD: The Town was prohibited from holding a public hearing with respect to the amendment to the zoning bylaw and from giving third reading to and adopting the bylaw. The application was dismissed in respect to the application for a discretionary use for a hotel development by the Palidwars. 1)The Town Council had acted openly and with candor. It did not have a duty to inform the applicants of the proposal because they were involved in the hotel industry. There was nothing improper about the initial confidentiality of the proposal and meetings in camera. 2)The shareholders' private interests were not being advanced rather than the community's best interest. Section 91(2) of the Urban Municipality Act and Harker v. Regina were noted. 3)There was nothing erroneous or improper in the method used to determine the selling price. 4)The question of the sale was still open. The Town was not subject to an unconditional commitment. The court could not intervene as it had not been established that the Town Council had fettered its discretion. 5)The process as a whole was tainted and should be set aside. The mayor and alderman, both shareholders and directors of the corporation, fell within the definition of partnership. They both had a pecuniary interest in the proposal within the meaning of the legislation. No finding was made that they acted with a dishonest or wrongful intent. The complaint respecting a violation of s.150(e) was not established. 6)It was not necessary to determine the adequacy of the notice required by s.207 of the Planning and Development Act. 7)It was beyond the court's jurisdiction to make an order prohibiting a hearing in respect to the application for a discretionary use by the Palidwars as they were not parties to these proceedings. The court's decision is not anticipatory in nature. 8)The applicants were awarded taxable costs of the application fixed at $400.","FIAT. The applicants sought an order prohibiting the respondent from holding a public hearing with respect to a proposed hotel development and from further considering an application for a discretionary use permit by Kathy and Gary Palidwar for private hotel development connected with the community facility known as the Evergreen Centre. HELD: The application was granted in part.  1) The applicants spoke of the public interest, it appears to be intimately entwined with their personal self-interest. 2) The Town Council took certain steps to bring the proposal to fruition. It was the practice of the council to move to the Committee-of-the-Whole and then return to open session to complete its business. 3) There was a specific complaint of unfair advantage or discrimination by reason of the fact that the proposed hotel would be connected to the community park. 4) The respondents met the statutory prerequisites for a public meeting. They did not conceal anything or attempt to do so. They acted honestly and with candor. 5) In each instance the fact of the 'in camera' meeting was recorded and the Council's consequent action was made part of the record. In the circumstances, reject the suggestion that there were any improper understandings. 6) The applicant are hoteliers who operate five of the six hotels and motels within the community and who have joined together in an informal association. The hotel proposal was not disclosed for two weeks. During that time no action was taken by the Council, although the members may have given thought to the proposal, something which they were entitled to do. The formal decision to actually facilitate the hotel development did not occur until June 14, 1999 when a resolution was passed to offer to sell land to the Palidwars. Prior to this the applicants had made their representations in opposition to the project. 7) The issues to be determined were: 1) was the nature of bad faith in the municipality; 2) has the respondent met its pre-judgment duty; and 3) has it complied with the provisions of the Local Government Act and the Land Use Code? The applicants were awarded judgment for breach of the bylaw by virtue of which the respondent was a party; and 8) has there been any unconscionable act by the municipality in acting in bad faith and in failing to obtain the pre-existing interest for which the by-law was created; and 9) What has been and will continue to be the subject of arbitration between the parties until such time as a result of the arbitration process conclude"
2009nsca44.txt,"The municipality appealed the trial court's decision to summarily strike their claim against the province, pursuant to R14.25 of the Civil Procedure Rules (1972). At trial, the municipality argued s. 36 of the Constitution Act compels the province to take appropriate steps to alleviate regional disparities. Arguing this is an enforceable obligation that was breached by the province, the municipality sought a declaration from the court to that effect. The municipality's arguments on appeal focused on the justiciability of s. 36. The province concentrated on the fact the judge had dismissed based on deficiencies in the pleadings, calling the municipality's claim too vague to succeed. Appeal dismissed. The effective standard of review is correctness - whether the judge erred in law by striking the claim. The appeal court carefully framed the issues, and examined s. 36 (its intent, and application). Rule 14.25 is a drastic remedy, and the trial judge was aware the province had a high threshold to meet in order to have the claim struck. While s. 36 might be justiciable, it does not provide an enforceable right to municipalities. Rather, it embodies an agreement among federal and provincial governments, and only those parties who were privy to the agreement can act to have it enforced. On this basis, the municipality's claim had no chance of success and the trial judge was correct to dismiss it.","The appellant sought a declaration to this effect from the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia. The court struck the claim as disclosing no reasonable cause of action. The appellant appealed. Appeal and cross-appeal dismissed; the court's standard of review is that of whether s. 36 is justiciable per se, or whether the appellant's allegations against the government have merit. In this case, the claim must survive unless the court makes a finding that the government has breached its constitutional commitment to properly distribute this federal funding. The Court reviewed the applicable legal principles surrounding applications to strike and, in this regard, the heavy burden faced by the appellant as an applicant for an order to strike."
6_2001nssc105.txt,"The plaintiff and defendant entered into an oral contract for the development and sale of land. The plaintiff brought an action to recover its commission on the contract. Plaintiff awarded commission of 4% as agreed to by the terms of the oral contract; in the alternative, the plaintiff is entitled to an award for unjust enrichment to compensate for the work done. Although the agreement could have went on longer, there was nothing preventing it from being performed completely within one year and thus the oral agreement was not only valid, but also enforceable. An award for unjust enrichment would be calculated using the commission rate agreed to by the parties.","The plaintiff obtained an oral agreement for the payment of fixed commission between the parties. The plaintiff sought to withdraw his claim against the defendant for breach of contract or in the alternative claim for unjust enrichment and/or quantum meruit. Finding for the plaintiff, that there was no oral agreement, that the oral agreement was enforceable, and that in the absence of an enforceable agreement the plaintiff was entitled to recover from the defendants based upon quantum meruits or unjust enrichment. The court was satisfied someone was honestly in error. The defendant carries on business as a licensed real estate broker with an office in Lunenburg. He is retired heart surgeon and resides with his wife at Halifax. He began to reside at Kingsburg as seasonal resident in 1973. The transactions were negotiated privately between the plaintiff and various owners of the lots. Title to all parcels of land vested in the plaintiff. The intention of the defendant was to develop a retirement farm. He had fertilized, ploughed, mowed and grazed portions of the land and had fencing erected. Up until 1995 the defendant had been the listing broker for the defendant's property, which he sold to the Nature Conservancy of Canada and Province of Nova Scotia.

He was granted costs on a contingency basis."
e_2017skqb380.txt,"HELD: 1) The court ordered joint custody and continued primary residence with the wife and specified access to the husband. The child’s interests were best served by a parenting regime that preserved the stability the wife provided as his primary caregiver, while expanding the periods of uninterrupted time with his father. It was best that the parties interact minimally with each other. The mother was generally contemptuous of the husband’s role as parent and sometimes restricted or denied the child’s access with him. There was no credible evidence that the child was suicidal as the mother alleged, nor did any evidence support her allegations of physical or sexual abuse. Rather, evidence confirmed that the child was smart, sometimes sensitive, but generally happy. 2) The husband had professional corporation. His income was determined from his line 150 income, as adjusted to reflect the actual dividend income he received. His income should not be augmented by dividend income equal to his corporation’s net earnings. Only current pre-tax earnings are truly surplus to corporation’s needs, without exposing it to encroachment on its capital or undermining its viability. The relevance of the wife’s income was limited to the apportionment of s. expenses. It was not appropriate to impute income to her. She was intentionally underemployed, but her decision was justified initially by the needs of her son and more recently by her own reasonable educational needs and the obligation to become qualified to practice medicine in Canada. Retroactive child support was not appropriate, except in respect of the two-month period when the wife was overseas, the husband was caring for their child and he admittedly neglected to pay child support in accordance with court order. There was considerable evidence upon which to conclude that a retroactive award would place an undue hardship upon the husband as, pursuant to the terms of this judgment, he was obliged to assume significant family debt, provide a considerable equalization payment and pay increased child and spousal support. 3) The husband retained the family home and sole responsibility for the mortgage thereon. The court ordered him to pay one half of the equity in the home to the wife. Otherwise, the parties were to retain all other items of family property in their respective possession and be solely responsible for any indebtedness in their respective names. The Family Property Act does not mandate the apportionment of debt, equal or otherwise, save to the extent that fairness requires an unequal division of family property to reflect the parties’ respective obligations. The court’s discretion to equalize the parties’ debt by an uneven division did not extend to the family home. 4) The wife was entitled to compensatory and non-compensatory spousal support. The disparity in their incomes was directly attributable to her role in the marriage and their mutual efforts to advance his career. The wife’s income consisted almost entirely of spousal support. However, the high amount of debt assumed by the husband coupled with his limited means for satisfying this judgment, warranted a departure from the range of outcomes suggested by the Spousal Support Advisory Guidelines. Given the genuine and material uncertainty as to the wife’s future need and extent to which she will achieve self-sufficiency, an indefinite award reviewable on the earlier of a date approximately one year from the trial date or the wife becoming qualified to practice medicine was appropriate. The court declined to impute income to the wife or to order retroactive spousal support. 5) Judgment for divorce was granted, with judgment to take effect on the conclusion of the appeal period.","HELD: The Court found the petitioner’s Federal Child Support Guidelines to be slightly in excess of $245,000 and directed that he pay interim child support for D.K. in the amount of $1,949.00 and interim spousal and child support of $5,250.00 per month. The petitioner had not taken a single vacation in the preceding two years and, as a result, claimed that the respondent had now unilaterally transferred their son, who was now residing in the U.S., to Saskatchewan. The respondent, who had recently commenced a pediatric critical care fellowship, had not been able to find a job in Canada and had intended, in the end, to pursue his chosen career, which he now believed was a career in medicine. The child had been attending a Montessori school for the past few months and, during this time, he was required to remain at the hospital every day. He also shared a residence with his sister (who was also a high school student) and their son (who resided in Regina at the time of his birth). The parties resided in a condominium in Regina and, after a series of temporary separations, they moved to Saskatoon, where the petitioner continued to reside with their son. He was granted access on the first three weekends of each month and every Wednesday. The mother subsequently applied for interim access. The action was subsequently pre-tried in July without success."

The defendant argued that the contract should be interpreted in a 'purposive' manner to protect the interests of the parties and to cut through all of the red tape. Awarding the defendant $2,430.00 per month as reasonable rental, that it should only be compensated for one-half of the amounts for shifting the signs and the electrical work. The alternative claim was that the defendant was entitled to compensation on the basis of unjust enrichment since it supplied a sign which had been used for the benefit of the defendants since May 1987. Dismissing the counterclaim without costs, that the plaintiff was not entitled to any damages for unjust enrichment."
7_2005skca97.txt,"This case concerns the fixture financing provisions of The Personal Property Security Act, 1993 (PPSA). The respondent claims damages from the appellant Credit Union. The claim arises from the Credit Union's delay in removing a Quonset in which the Credit Union held a security interest. The trial judge found in favour of the respondent and awarded damages on the basis that the Credit Union became a tenant at sufferance of the respondent when it failed to remove the Quonset and therefore was obliged to pay rent. The issue is whether the PPSA precludes a claim by a land owner against a financer arising from the financer's failure to remove a fixture within a commercially reasonable time after giving notice of its intentions in that regard. HELD: Appeal allowed. Cross appeal dismissed. In light of the causes of action pled and the evidence brought forward, the respondent's claim against the Credit Union cannot succeed.  1) Section 36 of the PPSA may speak exhaustively to the relative priorities of financers and land owners in fixtures. It does not necessarily speak in that way to the full range of rights and claims that those parties might have against each other. There is no principled basis on which a person with an interest in land should be denied meaningful relief when a financer, without excuse, acts in a commercially unreasonable manner by failing or refusing to remove a fixture after giving formal notice of its intention to do so. 2) It would have been improper for the respondent to deny permission to remove the building unless the Credit Union paid an amount in respect of the property taxes attributable to it. Allowing a person with an interest in land to oblige financers to pay property taxes before realizing on their security would amount to a substantial realignment of the careful balance between the rights of fixture financers and holders of property interest reflected in s. 36 of the PPSA. 3) The Credit Union could not have been either a tenant at sufferance or a tenant at will of the respondent for the fundamental reason that there was no landlord and tenant relationship between them. The respondent's claims in this regard fail. 4) The respondent has failed to present evidence that would allow this Court to quantify the benefit conferred on the Credit Union and to provide appropriate relief. As a consequence, no effect can be given to the unjust enrichment argument. 5) In light of the conclusion that there was no tenancy at sufferance or tenancy at will, the cross-appeal fails.","This case concerns the fixture financing provisions of The Personal Property Security Act, 1993. The respondent Gari Holdings Ltd. claims damages from the appellant Langham Credit Union Ltd. The claim arises from the Credit Union's delay in removing from Gari's land a quonset in which the respondent held a security interest. The trial judge found in favour of Gari and awarded damages on the basis that the Credit union became a tenant at sufferance when it failed to remove the quonet and therefore was obliged to pay rent. The Credit Union appealed. Appeal allowed; the trial judge's award effectively disregards the priority provisions of s. 36 of the PPSA and substitutes a new remedy for the rights expressly set out in ss. 36(9) and (16).Gari's actions following the failure of Lakeland were inconsistent with the regime established pursuant to the PPPA. It was also significant that Gari was seeking security for possible damage caused by removal of the Building but was not seeking rent and reimbursement for taxes paid. The cross-appeal evidence did not support the claim by Gari that the building remained on the property after it should have been removed. HELD: The appeal was allowed. The balance of rights and privileges for financers and persons with an interest in land was dealt with with respect to the rental of the building. There was no principled basis on which Gari should be denied meaningful relief when a financer, without excuse, acts in a commercially unreasonable manner by failing or refusing to remove a fixture after giving formal notice of its intention to do so. That stance would have been inconsistent with that of the landlord and tenant within the meaning of the Act. Gari’s claims in this regard must fail."
2_2011skqb102.txt,"The Crown appealed the respondent's acquittal on a charge of driving over .08. The Crown alleged that the trial judge erred in law by excluding two breath samples taken following the respondent's arrest on the basis that they were obtained in violation of s. 8 of the Charter of Rights. During trial, the defence gave verbal notice of a Charter issue but did not elect to seek a voir dire or called any evidence in support of the Charter application and did not call any witnesses for the defence. HELD: The Crown's appeal was granted and a verdict of guilty to driving over .08 was entered. The Court elected to impose sentence and remained seized with the matter. The trial judge failed to consider the totality of the circumstances in determining whether the officer had reasonable and probable grounds to make a breath demand. The trial judge erred in finding the officer's subjective belief in impairment was not supported by the facts. The Certificate of Analysis was admitted as a full exhibit and became part of the Crown's case. The Crown had proven the offence beyond a reasonable doubt in all respects.","The Crown appeals from the acquittal of the respondent on a charge of impaired driving. The Crown argues that the learned trial judge relied on irrelevant evidence and failed to consider other more relevant evidence. HELD: The appeal is dismissed. 1) The trial judge did not fail to fulfil the objective grounds for the demand. The appellant's driving actions were observed by the arresting officer, who was of the opinion that he was showing signs of impairment and she concluded that his ability to operate a motor vehicle was impaired by alcohol. 2) The breath samples taken after the arrest were obtained in violation of s. 8 of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms. 3) The officer was entitled to consider the circumstance as whole and need not prove prima facie case. The evidence showed that the accused stumbled and fell into his truck as he turned around. Thereafter, the accused sat in his vehicle with the door open and his left leg out while he unsuccessfully searched for his driver's licence and registration. This is not a position from which swaying would normally be observed. The accused was wearing muddy rubber boots and dirty clothing. He was attempting to find his way home to Weyburn. 4) The U-turn, while illegal, was explained as part of the act of returning to Gerald in order to re-orient himself. 5) The accused's explanation that he intended to drive from Esterhazy back to Gerald was not logical. The officer noted no other swaying or difficulty in the short observation period of about 3 minutes from the time of the stop to the time the demand was made. The readings were 110 mg/% and 100 mg/%. The accused displayed signs of confusion and was unable to locate his documentation in the truck despite extensive searching.  6) The appeal will proceed on the basis that the Crown seeks to overturn the acquittals on the charge of driving while over.08."
d_2016skca156.txt,"HELD: The appeal was allowed. The conviction was set aside and a new trial ordered. The court found that the trial judge erred by misapplying the test in Chaplin. He wrongly placed the burden on the defence to demonstrate the relevance of existing documents that the Crown refused to disclose. The court found that in light of the Crown’s late disclosure and non-disclosure, the trial judge erred by not a granting an adequate remedy to address the breach of s. 7 of the Charter by the Crown. In his decision regarding the adjournment request, the trial judge also erred in describing the index in this case as a Laporte inventory, a finding that allowed him to conclude that the Crown had met its disclosure obligations. The index was not a Laporte inventory as it was prepared for a different purpose and did not provide sufficient detail to permit the defence to decide whether to seek disclosure.","The Crown sought an adjournment of the trial to allow time for a review of recently disclosed and discovered documents. During the trial, defence counsel disclosed the existence of approximately 1,900 documents. The Crown sought to have the trial adjourned for a further day due to the complexity of the documents and the fact that several of the witnesses had booked flights. The defence counsel requested that the trial be set aside and new trial ordered. HELD: The appeal was allowed. The court found that the appropriate remedy to address the late and non-disclosure issue was a new trial. The documents remain undisclosed and the court was in the same position as the trial judge, which means that it is not in the court's position to assess the undisclosed documents to determine whether the undisclosed information could have affected the verdict. A new trial is the only remedy available."
d_2006nssc26.txt,"The two plaintiffs were injured when the defendant police officer made a left hand turn in front of their motor vehicle at night. Although the plaintiff driver was proceeding through a green light, the defendant alleged that her vehicle's headlights were not in operation. The driver suffered soft tissue injuries to her neck and mid and lower back, blunt trauma to both knees and bruising of the right hand. She underwent physiotherapy for three months and made a complete recovery within two years except for flare-ups in the upper back. The second plaintiff suffered neck stiffness, bilateral shoulder pain and bruising to his arm and leg. He underwent successful surgery for tendonitis in both shoulders and his neck improved with physiotherapy. General damages awarded to the plaintiff driver in the amount of $12,000; general damages awarded to the second plaintiff in the amount of $25,000 (reduced by 25% due to that plaintiff's failure to wear a seat belt). The court found that even if the second plaintiff's tendonitis was not caused by the accident, it was definitely aggravated by it. The headlights were in operation on the plaintiff's vehicle at the time of the collision; evidence was not presented which established that the defendant's expert was qualified to express the opinion he gave in his testimony as to the state of the headlights and even if he was qualified to express an opinion on the condition of the lights prior to the accident, his evidence was not probative and lacked consistency; it conflicted with the clear evidence advanced by persons at the scene prior to and at the time of the impact.","The plaintiff was injured in a motor vehicle accident. The defendants claimed the headlights were not in operation when it approached the intersection and that the plaintiff was contributory negligent for driving at 2:00 a.m. The accident occurred as a result of the negligence of the defendant in the operation of a Royal Canadian Mounted Police motor vehicle referred to herein as the 'police vehicle'. There are two issues with respect to liability for the accident. First, the defendants claim the beams in the defendant's vehicle were not operating at the time the accident occurred. The second issue relates to wear and tear. The defendant testified that he did not see the accident occur but that he was aware that the plaintiffs vehicle was approaching the intersection when he turned his vehicle right. The plaintiff was in near perfect condition. She said she was struck in the intersection by the police vehicle which was fifty feet behind the defendant vehicle. HELD: The plaintiff is entitled to recover damages from the defendants. 1) The evidence of the police officer convinced the court he was not qualified to express an opinion. The evidence from the plaintiff's lawyer convinced the Court that the defendant gave detailed evidence of where he was on the highway and finite details as to his speed at those locations. The Court could not accept the testimony of a witness who was looking 'about 90 degrees to his right' when he observed the vehicle in the parking lot. 2) The Court was unable to determine how close the plaintiff came to the intersection or the extent of attention she paid to it. There was no evidence that either of the parties was impaired. 3) The plaintiff's concern was focused on the officer. He did not follow some of the directions and recommendations in the Traffic Accident Investigation Manual."
2_1999skqb76.txt,"Division of matrimonial property and the matrimonial home were in issue. The respondent claimed exemption for his own house and all of the assets he had before the marriage which lasted 21 months. HELD: The petitioner was awarded $1,945 plus costs of $5,000. The respondent's claim was inequitable in its entirety. 1)Saskatchewan precedents suggest that neither a marriage of short duration nor prior ownership of a home or inheritance or gifts by one side of the family constituted extraordinary circumstances. However, prior ownership by the petitioner and its occupancy by her children, the economic imbalance between the spouses and the brevity of the marriage combined to make this an 'extraordinary' case. The home was to remain in the petitioner's name. It was the long term family home of the petitioner and her 10 children born of a previous marriage. Five of those children still lived with her in the home. The respondent had a permanent job, the prospect of an inheritance, a pension and his own home with no mortgage. 2)Credit was given to the respondent for half of the debts assumed. One-half of the accrual to his pension and his two life insurance contracts was credited to the petitioner less a 30% deduction for income tax. The respondent's house, jointly owned with his mother, was exempt property.","The wife had been left in poverty by the departure of the breadwinner in whose name most of the family assets were habitually held. In many cases she was left with nowhere to live. Under the provisions of s. 22 of The Matrimonial Property Act, 1997, it was recognized that most often the young children of a broken home remain in the custody of the mother and so discretion was given to the judge to ameliorate the equal division regime which the registration imposed. HELD: The wife was awarded $1,945 plus an award of $5,000 for a total of $6,960.00. The husband was given one-half of the matrimonial home valued at $8,358.00, half of which accrues to each of the parties or $4,445.00; and the other half accrualed to a Standard Life policy during the same period in the amount of $2,200. These two items were subject to income tax so the judge applied a 30% deduction to their value, leaving $7,690.00 to be credited to him. To that number must be added the accrual to a Sun Life Policy during the period between the marriage and the application date of May 21, 1998 valued at approximately $8.358. This was an extraordinary case and the wife may have met her ordinary circumstances in order to remain in poverty. The Court accepted the claim that the wife's house, jointly owned with his mother as protection 'in case he meets someone' is exempt property. The claim was in its entirety inequitable and had he not filed a counter petition there would have been no division, no trial and no excessive legal costs because the petition made no property claims whatever."
b_1990canlii4176.txt,"This was an action for damages for wrongful dismissal. The plaintiff had worked for 28 years for the defendant as a driver making deliveries to customers. The defendant dismissed the plaintiff for 'disregard of company policy related to hours of work and overtime'. The plaintiff had taken longer coffee and lunch breaks than were allowed, and had taken unauthorized breaks for which he had then been paid overtime by the defendant. For the defendant, that the dismissal was justified. The court considered seven factors in assessing whether the defendant had discharged the onus upon it to prove on the balance of probabilities that there was just cause for the dismissal including whether the rules of the company had been distributed to the plaintiff, if the plaintiff was aware of the rules, whether the rules were consistently enforced, whether the plaintiff was properly warned of the consequences of breaching the rules, if the rules were reasonable, whether the breaches were sufficiently serious to justify termination, and whether a reasonable excuse existed for breaching the rules.","The plaintiff was employed by the defendant as driver and driver's helper for 28 years. He was dismissed from his employment without notice in 1988 for his 'disregard of company policy related to hours of work and overtime'. The plaintiff claimed that he was entitled to a fifteen minute break for breakfast and an unpaid supper break for lunch. The defendant argued that the plaintiff's dismissal was justified because he failed to comply with company policy regarding breaks and overtime. Awarding the plaintiff $15.00 for an hour of work over an eight hour period, that day's break was $5.00 less an hour than normal and that it was necessary for the plaintiff to account for receipts and items that were not able to be delivered because the customer was not at home. The plaintiff contended that his breaks were for his meal and he was also entitled to an additional 15 minute break during the day. Dismissing the action for wrongful dismissal, that there was no reasonable excuse for the breaches of the policies. The failure of the company to distribute the rules in writing was crucial. The onus is on the defendant to prove on the balance of probabilities that there is a just cause for the dismissal of the plaintiff. It is apparent from the testimony of three other drivers that the practice of the drivers and helpers was common throughout the company. It was evident from the evidence that they all took breaks during their shifts. The implication of breaking the rules was sufficiently serious to justify termination."
5_2011nssc53.txt,"A co-executor and beneficiary under his mother's will, Mr. Hand applied for an order confirming her gift of a one-half interest in a condo held jointly by his parents until her death. His sister and his father, Dr. Hand, successfully defeated the motion, with the court holding the gift was invalid and the condo passed solely to Dr. Hand on Mrs. Hand's death. Dr. Hand abandoned his motion for costs, but Mr. Hand sought to have his solicitor-client costs paid out of the estate. In the alternative, he sought party and party costs against his father and sister. The parties will bear their own costs. There is no need to depart from the general rule that the successful party is entitled to costs. Here, this would be Dr. Hand but since he is not seeking costs, none will be awarded. As for the proposition that it's appropriate to have the estate pay costs related to estate litigation, it doesn't apply here. The will's meaning was not unclear, the gift was just invalid. The central issue was between Mr. Hand and his father: was Dr. Hand required to stand by his previous gift, and were the wills made by he and his wife mutual wills subject to a promise against revocation? In this sense, this was not estate litigation, but rather a dispute between two living persons about the contractual obligations of one of them.","The estate applied to have its solicitor and client costs paid out of the estate. The father sought party and party costs. The daughter was acting on their own. HELD: The application was not 'estate litigation' but rather a litigation between two living persons about the contractual obligations of one of them. The purpose of an award of costs is to provide the successful party with partial but substantial indemnity against legal fees measured by what would ordinarily be charged to a client for the kind of work undertaken on behalf of a successful party in the actual case. The three parties will bear their own costs.  1) It was necessary for the estate to participate in the application because it originally involved questions about Mrs. Hand's property, it involved demand for accounting, and the late Mr. Thomas Burchell, Q.C., was subpoenaed to give evidence about both the estate and the wills he drafted. The entire application was sham and was therefore sham and that no lawyer should be paid anything. 2) The central issue in the father's application was the meaning of his mother's will. She clearly made a gift to him that failed. The possibility of that failure was brought to the attention of the deceased's daughter. However, the issue was one between the father and his father. Was the father required to stand by his 1999 will, including the gift of the condominium to his son? 3) The issue was the respondent's failure to provide an accounting. There was also an issue about the failure of the representatives of the Hand's estate to provide any accounting. That was resolved only as the hearing began."
b_2010skqb249.txt,"The plaintiff veterinarian states that his personal and professional reputation has been damaged by defamatory statements made by the defendants. He worked at the veterinary college at the University of Saskatchewan, and an employee was involved in a grievance process. The plaintiff was involved by virtue of his supervisory position at the college. He asserts these statements were posted on bulletin boards in the plaintiff's workplace and postings on the union website. The statements were produced in connection with the labour grievance and alleged that the plaintiff failed to prevent harassment in the workplace in supervisory capacity or engaged in such harassment himself. The plaintiff seeks damages and costs. He states that he was pushed to leave his employment and is now engaged in private practice which pays less and is not as stable. He has incurred costs to move to the United States to obtain employment.HELD: The elements of defamation are: 1) the words would tend to lower the plaintiff's reputation in the eyes of a reasonable person, 2) the words in fact referred to the plaintiff, and 3) the words were published (Grant v. Torstar Corp.). In these circumstances, the plaintiff was defamed. The defendants raise the defence of absolute privilege. This defence provides that 'no action for defamatory statements can exist where such statements are made in the course of judicial or quasi-judicial proceedings' (Getz v. Opseth). The Trade Union Act establishes mandatory arbitration for the resolution of labour grievances and empowers the arbitration board or chairperson with court-like functions and powers. The Saskatchewan Court of Appeal has found that an arbitration board fulfills quasi-judicial function (Fletcher Challenge Energy Canada Inc. v. Sulz). The Court does not allow the defence of absolute privilege as it is usually considered in the context of the actual hearing before the body. In this case, the statements were produced as a notice in order to bring further witnesses forward from the college. The Court instead determines the statements fall within the defence of qualified privilege. This applies in a situation where the statements are made in order to discharge the board member's duty. The Court finds the statements were made in order to gather further evidence and witnesses, which is part of the board's duties. The protection of qualified privilege may be removed on where there is evidence that the dominant purpose of the statements was malice. There is no such evidence in this case, therefore the defence of qualified privilege succeeds. Nonetheless the Court provides an opinion on damages on a provisional basis. There was no evidence that the plaintiff was forced to leave his position and move to the United States following the incident. The Court therefore concludes fair compensation would be $25,000. Since the results are mixed, there is no award of costs.","The plaintiff claims his personal and professional reputation has been seriously damaged by defamatory statements made by the defendants. The plaintiff took four years post-graduate course in Illinois and received a Master of Science in 1984. In 1984, he started work at the University of Saskatchewan as an assistant professor. He received his full professorship in 1991. He was appointed director of the Veterinary Teaching Hospital (VTH) in 2002. During the long weekend, the part of the hospital was closed to the public. During and after the renovation to the building, the plaintiff kept a log of his work log from May 2005 to January 2006. It appears that the notice was posted on bulletin boards in the plaintiff's workplace, by means of mass mailing to all members of the Canadian Union of Public Employees (CUPE) and by posting on the CUPE website. HELD: The plaintiff has proven that he was defamed. The privilege attaches to any utterance reasonably related to the subject of the judicial inquiry. The Court accepts the defendants' defence of qualified privilege. 1) Absolute privilege extends to all communications made by high executive officers acting in the performance of their official duties relating to matters of state. Matters made outside the proceedings of that body, even though made by members of Parliament, are not protected by an absolute privilege. The Union has worked to ensure that the plaintiff was able to return to a harassment-free, non-toxic workplace environment but was forced to file this grievance when Ms. Bowman experienced renewed personal harassment after her return. This is an intentional violation of an employer's duty of care which constitutes intentional interference with an employee's workplace reputation. Jurisdiction is one of strict liability. 2) There is no basis for jurisdictional defence. The words of the grievance raised by the plaintiff were found to be highly impugned and had a deleterious effect on the reputation of the plaintiff. The defendants have failed to establish a jurisdictional basis for their defence. 3) The plaintiff was not required to show that the defendant intended to do harm or was careless in his attempts to prevent the harassment or that he himself was a contributory participant in the intentional intentional infliction of emotional trauma on an individual who had been out of the workplace for several months. The mere allegation that he actively participated in the harassment is beyond the scope of the claim and beyond the jurisdiction of the Court of Appeal. The claim is dismissed with costs."
8_1998canlii13830.txt,"An appeal of conviction on a charge of dangerous driving on the grounds the trial judge erred in holding that statements made by the appellant were not made pursuant to the Highway Traffic Act and therefore admissible in the criminal proceedings; and in holding the statements could have been made simply because the appellant wished to have his description of the accident presented to the police and therefore were voluntary and admissible. The defence at the voir dire was that the statement by the accused that he was the driver of the vehicle was given pursuant to the compulsion of a statute, s 83 of the Highway Traffic Act, and as such was not a 'voluntary' statement. Arguments during trial were based upon the application of common law principles of voluntariness. HELD: The appeal was allowed, the conviction set aside and a new trial ordered. During the appeal it was recognized that the question of voluntariness raised a s7 Charter issue which was not raised in the trial nor in the notice of appeal. Objections to the admissiblilty of the accused's statements based upon the Charter raise a different issue and considerations from the application of common law principles and a different conclusion may have been reached.","The appellant appeals his conviction on a charge of dangerous driving contrary to s. 249(1)(a) of the Criminal Code. HELD: The appeal is allowed. The conviction is set aside and a new trial in the Provincial Court is ordered. 1)Had the Charter issues been properly raised and argued before the learned trial judge, a conclusion different from the one reached (based solely upon the application of common law principles of voluntariness) may have resulted. 2)The trial judge erred in holding that the statements made by the appellant were not made pursuant to the Highway Traffic Act and therefore admissible in criminal proceedings.  3)Although the trial judge concluded that the appellant's statement was voluntary and admissible, the Court of Appeal was correct in finding that the statement could have been made simply because the appellant wished to have his description of the accidentpresented to the police.  4)The appellant appealed on two grounds. The first was that the provincial court reviewed the circumstances of the conviction and found it was impossible to agree with her conclusions in this respect or her statement that notwithstanding the evidence of Constable Louvel already referred to she was not aware of the reason why Mr. Chow attended at the police station and gave the information and that it was his understanding the appellant did so to give an accident report. The second ground of appeal was that she could not say that the question arose in this case as to whether or not the highway Traffic Act obligation to give a report to the Police renders any statement made during the report involuntary. The statement made by Mr.Chow was given a compulsion of statute which was not a voluntary statement and therefore ought to be ruled inadmissible. Objections to the admissibility of the accused'sstatements based upon s.7 of the Charter raise a different issueand different considerations from the Application of Common Law Principles."

9_1998canlii13836.txt,"The accused who had plead guilty to a charge of dangerous driving causing death sought a conditional sentence to be served in the community. Various witnesses gave conflicting accounts of the driving leading up to the accident and the accident itself. Two vehicles driving at a high rate of speed, one in the left lane and one in the right hand curb lane passed vehicles stopped at a cross walk, the later striking and killing a pedestrian. The vehicles had been observed pulling around other vehicles whenever possible and 'jousting' with each other. HELD: A sentence of 90 days to be served intermittently in a provincial correctional centre was imposed. Conditions of probation included restraint from the consumption of alcohol and non-prescription drugs for 24 hours prior to attendance at the centre. An 18 month probation order required him to perform 200 hours of community service and to enroll in a defensive driving course. He was prohibited from operating a motor vehicle for three years and was to pay a surcharge of $250.  1)The Saskatchewan Court of Appeal had not to date considered the question of whether it was appropriate that a sentence of imprisonment be served in the community where the offence is that of dangerous driving causing death. It has consistently endorsed sentences of incarceration for the offence of impaired driving causing death. Alternatives to incarceration were rejected as not adequately reflecting the gravity of the offence and as not serving to deter either the offender or the general public from committing like offences. 2)The driver's lack of attention together with excessive speed caused the accident. Alcohol was not involved. He stopped to render assistance whereas the driver of the second car which had been racing with him left the scene of the accident immediately. Principles of general and specific deterrence, rehabilitation, denunciation, protection of the public and maintenance of public confidence in the administration of justice were to be considered. 3)Specific deterence had to be emphasized in view of the driver's subsequent convictions for two speeding offences. The accused had six speeding convictions. He had a minor youth record involving mischief.","The accused plead guilty to a charge of dangerous driving causing death. He was driving a motor vehicle that was operating in the manner dangerous to the public. HELD: The accused was sentenced to imprisonment in the community at a rate of 18 months. 1)It was difficult to understand how the trauma of the accident could not have resulted in the accused's driving habits to be changed. These convictions must be viewed as an aggravating circumstance requiring some emphasis on specific deterrence. 2)The accused was convicted of two speeding offences. His driving was mechanically unsound and he took the risk to do so. His actions were clearly inappropriate and imprudent and his failure to monitor his surroundings with alcohol and drugs resulted in his death. 3)Although the accused had consumed significant quantity of alcohol and was in no shape to drive a vehicle, his consumption of alcohol appeared to be a contributing factor."
9_2008skqb301.txt,"FIAT: The defendant applies pursuant to Rule 41(1) and Rule 215(1) of the Queen's Bench Rules and the inherent jurisdiction of the Court for an order severing the issues of liability and assessment of damages in the plaintiff's claim. They ask that disclosure, discoveries and the trial ought to proceed to determine whether the defendants are liable to the plaintiffs and to what extent. Then, if liability is found, disclosure, discoveries and the trial should proceed to assess damages. The defendant also seeks an order pursuant to Rule 173 of the Queen's Bench Rules striking a paragraph of the plaintiff's claim. HELD: 1) Authority to sever trials in Saskatchewan is founded on the Court's inherent jurisdiction. Laing C.J.Q.B. reviewed the discretion available to the Court in Chaban v. Kramer Ltd., 2008 SKQB 27. Upon considering the factors in Chaban, it must be concluded that the defendants' application has merit. There is clear severability between the threshold issue of liability and the consequential issue of damages in the plaintiffs' action. The entitlement to sue for disgorgement of profits hinges on whether the defendant, as the plaintiff's former employee, was in a position of a fiduciary. Disclosure pertaining to the defendants' ongoing business, financial affairs and clientele become relevant only upon a finding of liability. The Court may exercise its discretion only if the court can make a finding that the defendants will suffer severe prejudice if the issues of liability and damages are not bifurcated. Much of the defendants' client base results from a joint venture with a major accounting firm. This joint venture requires confidentiality. Disclosure of these relationships would jeopardize the defendants' obligation to maintain this confidence. Serious prejudice to the defendants in the instant case has been established. It is appropriate to exercise the Court's discretion in the defendants favour and grant the order severing the plaintiffs' claim against them. The application to sever the threshold issue of liability from damages only pertains to the plaintiffs' claim. The defendants' counterclaim against the plaintiffs and their two principals shall continue in the normal course. 2) The defendants' application to strike portions of the plaintiffs' statement of claim is dismissed. The paragraphs refer to Wolff being an applied science technologist and holding himself out as a person with a strong sense of ethics. The plaintiffs plead that the code of ethics for an applied science technologist provides that a person with such a designation will not 'use directly or indirectly an employer's or client's confidential information' in competition with the client and alleges that Wolff has breached the code of ethics. While Wolff may be subject to discipline by his governing body, that does not constitute a multiplicity of proceedings as defined by s. 29 of The Queen's Bench Act. The facts pled are material facts relevant to the plaintiff's claim of Wolff's breach of fiduciary duty and breach of contract.","FIAT: The parties reached an impasse on the required disclosure and sought various orders. The defendants asked that the Court exercise its discretion and sever the plaintiffs' claim between liability and damages and sought an order that certain paragraphs of the plaintiff's claim be struck. The plaintiffs and defendants by counterclaim applied pursuant to Queen's Bench Rule 215(1) for an order severing the issues of liability and assessment of damages and the issue of damages to be determined. HELD: The application to sever the threshold issue of liability from damages only pertained to the plaintiffs and the defendants' claim of breach of fiduciary duty and breach of contract. The plaintiff's counterclaim against the defendants and their two principals shall continue in the normal course.  1) The court has considered the effect of disclosure on promoting settlement between the parties. The issues in this litigation are such that delay in full disclosure of material pertaining to damages makes little difference. Both parties know the profitability of the SR&ED consulting business. The risks that must be weighed in considering settlement pertain to liability. Those risks have not changed by granting the defendants their application. 2) The defendants' application to strike portions of the claim was dismissed. The court reviewed the relevant case law and found that bifurcation of the liability and damage issues does not outweigh the severe prejudice to the moving party as opposed to ordinary prejudice. 3) While other common law provinces have specific rules addressing the withholding of disclosure until after an issue has been determined, our court has found that such authority now rests with our inherent jurisdiction.  4) The Court reviewed the case of Anderson Preece Associates Inc. v. Dominion Appraisal Group Inc. (1984), 54 O.R. (2d) 425 (Ont. H.C.). The Alberta Court considered the application under its Alberta Rules of Court pertaining to the contents of the defendant's affidavit of documents. 5) The Saskatchewan Court of Appeal in Potash Corp. of Saskatchewan Mining Ltd.(SPM) v. Allendale Mutual Insurance Co. (1988), 87 Sask. R. 184 (C.A.), clarified that, although there is no specific rule in place in Saskatchewan, such authority lies with the Court to sever an action. In this application, the defendants asserted that they have developed their own 'SR&ED application process' by cultivating relationships with accounting firms, industry associations, post-secondary learning institutions and various business organizations. They alleged that Wolff, as its former employee, was in breach of a confidentiality and non"
d_2016skpc19.txt,"HELD: The court found that the material viewed met the definition of child pornography as defined by the Criminal Code. Only the accused had access to his computer and knew his password. There was no evidence that the accused’s spouse was in any way involved. The evidence established that all of the file-sharing traffic came into the accused’s residence through a router that directed everything to the red computer only. The encryption on the red computer was so formidable that the best forensic technicians from the RCMP were not able to get past it. The court found that it would be unlikely for the accused not to detect a hacker given the encryption and his monitoring of bandwidth usage. A witness also testified that the accused’s operating system could not be accessed remotely. The court rejected the accused’s testimony given all of the Crown’s evidence. The Crown witnesses were all forthright and credible, whereas the accused was less forthcoming. The court found that the Crown met their burden of proving the offences beyond a reasonable doubt.","The accused was charged with possession of child pornography, contrary to s. 163.1(4) of the Criminal Code. The accused was a member of the RCMP Internet Child Exploitation Unit (ICE) and testified that he monitored file sharing networks for subjects who were accessing, possessing, or sharing child pornography using file sharing software. The ICE unit was involved in the investigation. The Court found that the accused had access to child pornography through a router. The router was used to direct traffic between the residence and the residence. As the residence was often visited by persons accessing the centralized server model, it is not possible for the data to end up at some other device because of the internal IP of the computer and the physical MAC address of the particular computer."
7_2013skqb67.txt,"The petitioner and the respondent had separated and had held a settlement meeting regarding the resolution of various issues. The respondent filed a Notice of Objection to the petitioner's affidavit regarding the meeting and the appended exhibit that was entitled: 'Minutes of the Meeting'. The petitioner stated that there was no agreement that what had been agreed upon in the meeting could not be used in evidence, although he acknowledged that not all outstanding issues were resolved in the meeting. The other issues before the Court were the custody of the children, the parenting arrangements and whether the petitioner should pay interim spousal and child support and in what amount. The respondent remained in the family home and sought an order for exclusive possession. The 3 children of the marriage resided with her in it. She had recently obtained a position as an educational assistant and would be earning $19,000 per year and the petitioner's annual income was $87,000. The parties could not agree on who may claim the eligible dependant credit or AED for the children. HELD: The Court held that because the parties had not reached agreement on all of the issues, the settlement privilege extended to the agreement. Therefore, the exhibit and a number of sentences in the petitioner's affidavit were struck. The Court ordered a shared parenting arrangement and gave the respondent an order for exclusive possession of the family home until June 2013. The petitioner was ordered to pay $1,213 per month in child support and additional $186 per month to contribute to child care expenses and his proportional share of s. 7 expenses. The petitioner was ordered to pay interim spousal support in the amount of $500 per month. The Court reviewed the tax consequences to the parties, particularly in light of the shared parenting arrangement and noted that as the parties could not agree on who may claim the eligible dependant credit or AED for the children that that matter should be dealt with at the pre-trial conference.","The parties have three children. The petitioner is a stay at home parent who worked casual shifts as an educational assistant. Following separation, the petitioner was making mortgage payments and paying utilities. In May 2012, he advised she would no longer contribute to the mortgage payment and would be reducing the child support payments to $926. He also indicated that he would stop paying the utilities, the van payment, life insurance premiums and child support of $1,300 per month as they have not cohabitated in the past twelve months. The respondent brought a motion returnable October 19, 2012 claiming child and spousal support together with exclusive possession of the family home. HELD: 1) The parties shall have joint custody of the children pursuant to a shared parenting arrangement.  2) The respondent shall receive credit for monies which he has paid from September 1, 2012 onward. 3) The petitioner does not oppose the respondent remaining in the home on a time limited basis and suggests it should terminate June 27, 2013. There was no agreement that any agreements reached at the meeting could not be used in evidence. There is a need and ability to pay.  4) The court reviewed the policy considerations which underly settlement privilege and as identified in Tucker-Lester require that unless all of the issues have been resolved, privilege continues to extend to those issues where there may be a consensus unless there is a clear understanding and agreement that once one of the issue is resolved it is off the table and considered to be settled irrespective of what may happen with respect to other issues that may exist as between the parties. The circumstance at hand is a pre-trial conference and adjustments can be made to support orders made on an interim basis."
a_1995canlii4000.txt,"The Appellant/Defendant, Bennett appealed a judgment resulting from a jury trial. At trial, the Plaintiff had been awarded damages for injuries suffered in a motor vehicle accident. The Defendant limited her appeal to the amount awarded for future loss of earnings. The Respondent/Plaintiff cross-appealed on the issue of whether the trial judge should have directed the jury to deduct sick leave benefits from her past loss of income. Also at issue was whether a forensic accountant should have been permitted to testify as to the present value of the Plaintiff's future earning capacity. HELD: Appeal dismissed. 1)The forensic accountant's evidence was properly admitted as explanatory of the calculations done. The same calculations could have been done by a computer program or by counsel or the trial judge with the assistance of the tables to the Rules of Court. 2)The trial judge properly explained to the jury that the accountant was not testifying as an expert. 3)Given the nature of the accountant's evidence, no expert fees should be permitted to the Plaintiff for the accountant's report or attendance. 4)The Appellant's argument that the trial judge failed to properly direct the jury as to the weight to be given to the accountant's evidence was rejected. 5)The Court was unable to say that the jury's award for loss of future income was so inordinately high that it should be set aside and a new trial ordered. 6)The Plaintiff's cross-appeal relating to the disability benefits was also dismissed.","The defendant applied for damages in a jury trial for personal injuries and loss sustained in an automobile. The trial judge awarded damages in the amount of $409,251.18. The defendant argued that the trial judge erred in law in failing to caution the jury regarding the weight to be given evidence of Douglas Kalesnikoff. HELD: Application dismissed. 1)Since liability was admitted by the defendant the trial was limited to assessment of damages by the jury. The plaintiff's argument on future loss of income was so inordinately high that it is perverse, wholly out of all proportion, unsupported by the evidence and unreasonable. 2)The trial judge clearly intended to minimize the impact on the plaintiff's ability to work and to be of assistance to the court in the determination of technical or scientific matters. The fact that the plaintiff was 35 years old at the time of the collision, she had a working age of 65 years. Given the Queen's Bench Tables and documentary evidence, these calculations did not require expert opinion evidence. 3)Although the plaintiff made the calculations in P-16, she was rendered unconscious and remained in a state of post-traumatic amnesia for approximately 4 hours. No medical evidence was found that would have affected her ability to continue in the field of nursing. 4)No substantial wrong or miscarriage of justice was demonstrated but the Court rejected the appellant's first ground of appeal. The award for impaired earning capacity could be taken as lump sum, paid at the conclusion of litigation."

He argued the youth court judge erred in concluding statements made to the police were made voluntarily. Allowing the appeal and ordering a new trial, that both the appellant's sister and girlfriend gave evidence of inducements by the police to the accused to admit to the alleged crimes, in return for a lighter sentence. The trial judge failed to address this evidence, thereby committing a palpable and overriding error.","The young offender who was convicted of nine charges of break and enter and one charge of assault claimed that the Youth Court judge erred in law in concluding that the statements taken from him by the R.C.M.P. in March 1992 were voluntary statements. He appealed the convictions on two of the charges and a new trial was ordered on the basis that if the statements were not admissible, the Crown would have failed to prove, beyond a reasonable doubt, that they were voluntary. The failure by the trial judge to make any finding with respect to this issue was a palpable and overriding error. The statement given to police officer was only admissible if it is a voluntary statement."
e_2001nssc162.txt,"The defendant made an addition to single family residence. Following a dispute between the parties as to whether the defendant's use of the property now complied with the plaintiff's land-use bylaw for a single family residence, a consent order was issued dealing with the structure of the property and how it would be used. The plaintiff sought a finding that the defendant was in contempt of the consent order, seeking enforcement of the provisions of the consent order and an order that the defendant pay a fine. Defendant found in contempt of consent order; fine ordered in the amount of $10,000; if defendant has not complied with the terms of the consent order by January 31, 2002, the Sheriff is ordered to enter the property and receive the rents, profits and income thereof until the defendant clears his contempt; the door and hardware between the original structure and the addition is be removed; any references to separate apartments are to be removed from the property; the second power meter is to be removed from the property and the second cable television connection and associated billing provisions are to be eliminated; the defendant is to provide within 15 days the names of all tenants and if and when there are changes in any of the tenants, he must provide the plaintiff with the particulars of the new and remaining tenants; all tenants must be notified in writing prior to entry of occupation that the entire structure and building is only to be occupied as a single dwelling unit; copies of any written leases are to be provided to the plaintiff within 15 days of their execution; the plaintiff can enter the premises for the purposes of random inspection on a bi-monthly basis until the plaintiff is satisfied that this Order has been complied with and thereafter, the plaintiff is entitled to inspect the premises at random once a month while the defendant remains the owner of the property; the fine will not be crystallized into a judgment and execution if the defendant complies fully with all the requirements of this order on or before January 1, 2002. The plaintiff is entitled to solicitor-client costs.","The owner of a single family home applied for a variance to convert the existing use to a two unit dwelling so that it could have two units without changing the side yard requirements. The proposal failed and the owner was imprisoned for 10 days. The owner appealed the order and sought a finding that he was in contempt of the Consent Order. HELD: The application was dismissed with costs to the court in the amount of $25,000. The fine was not to be crystalized into a Judgment and Execution and the plaintiff was entitled to proceed with the taxation of its costs and disbursements. 1)The dwelling was in contravention of the Halifax Regional Municipality's Land Use By-laws. 2)The owner was ordered to provide a copy of the lease to the landlord within fifteen days of its execution or any alternation in the lease or tenants to it. There was nothing in the owner's Affidavit or the Affidavits of any of his tenants to indicate any concrete steps had been taken to rectify the situation. 3)Random inspections of the entire structure and building could be every week as an excessive imposition on the owner. He had, however, created a situation and some inspection capacity was limited. He was restricted to twice a month, bi-monthly inspections to continue until the City was satisfied that the Order had been complied with. 4)The fine was to be paid within two weeks of the order being made. In such circumstances, the proper exercise of discretion is to recognize the extraordinary circumstances that exists, willfulness of the contempt and failure at any effort to purge requires an award of solicitor and client costs and so order."
2_2001nssc171.txt,"A dispute arose between a landlord and a tenant about damage to the premises and whose responsibility it was to repair the damage. The dispute was referred to arbitration as per the terms of the lease. The arbitrator found the tenant liable for the damage and ordered the tenant to pay the landlord specified amounts for repairs and loss of rental opportunity. The tenant made an application for judicial review of the arbitrator's decision. Application allowed in part; portions of arbitrator's decision where he accepted estimates of costs of repairs and loss of rental opportunity, awarded damages and applied the equitable principle of estoppel quashed; application dismissed with respect to the rest of arbitrator's decision. The arbitration clause was a limited arbitration clause and the arbitrator did not have jurisdiction to award damages or apply the equitable principle of estoppel. Although greater deference is shown to decisions of consensual arbitrators than to those of statutory arbitrators, consensual arbitrators are not immune from judicial review if the means of reaching the result were unreasonable. The results reached within the arbitrator's jurisdiction were not patently unreasonable.","The lease between the Landlord and Tenant and the operator of the Oshawa Group contained an arbitration clause. The Tenant sought to have the award of the arbitrator made pursuant to that clause quashed. The issues were: 1) Did the loss occur as a result of the acts or omissions of the Tenants or its servants and agents? 2) Was the loss covered by insurance and whether insurance should have covered the damage; 3) Did estoppel apply? The arbitrator was not limited to the interpretation of the clauses of the lease. He could deal with the issue of insurance coverage and whether the amount of damages. The disputes were with respect to two sets of clauses: repair and loss of rental opportunity. The arbitration clause under the lease was a limited arbitration clause, which did not provide that all disputes between the parties were to be settled by arbitration, but only disputes with regard to clauses in the lease itself. The decision was patently unreasonable. Both parties agreed that the standard of review was correctness and that it should be extended to the determination of the facts and to the effect of the legislation statutory tribunal is empowered to administer. They also agreed that there was a need for a wider scope of judicial review in the case of consensual arbitrations. HELD: The award would withstand judicial review.  1) The Arbitrator was correct in concluding that he had authority to award damages. That is beyond the scope of the arbitration clause because it is not dispute about the clauses or provisions of the leased. There is no jurisdiction to resolve a claim such as this which arises from the landlord/tenant relationship itself and not the clauses and provisions of a lease. The more specialized the tribunal the less inclined the courts should be to be to interfere with its awards. 2) It was the intent of the parties as expressed in the decision at issue in the Canada Post case, which set out the principles of curial deference, and for judicial restraint, in determining whether the arbitration agreement does not apply to the dispute raised by the proposed arbitration. The principles of waiver/estoppel applied as against the applicants."
c_1999canlii12484.txt,"In issue was whether the law firm was in a conflict of interest with respect to two matrimonial files and whether the firm could remain as counsel for the spouses. HELD: 1)A lawyer with Olive Waller acts as counsel for Janie Magnes and Daniel L'Heureux. The lawyer who recently joined the law firm of Olive Waller had worked on both files of the opposing spouses while practicing law with another firm. At the time she left she was the solicitor for Mr. Magnes. She had received confidential information from both opposing spouses. 2)The screen was sufficient and there was not a risk of mischief in the circumstances of this case. There was no real risk that either would be prejudiced if the law firm continued to act. A reasonable member of the public, in possession of the facts and aware of the screening procedures set in place, would conclude that no unauthorized disclosure of confidential information occurred or would occur. There were numerous independently verifiable steps taken by the subsequent firm to implement screening. Both lawyers and support staff were instructed in writing not to discuss either matters or the lawyer's prior representation of those clients with her. The files were physically segregated from the regular filing system in a locked cabinet. The files were specifically identified and accessible only to those lawyers and support staff who were working on the matter. The computer files were encoded and segregated on the firm's network and access was limited to two people. 3)There was no order as to costs.","This was an application for a determination as to whether the law firm of Olive, Waller, Zinkhan & Waller is in a position of conflict of interest with respect to the matrimonial files.

HELD: The law firm was satisfied that the screen was sufficient in the circumstances of this case. There was no risk of real mischief and the screening measures taken by Olive Waller were effective. There were numerous independently verifiable steps that should be taken to ensure that no disclosure to the former client's confidential information will occur."
e_2012skpc43.txt,"The accused was charged with impaired driving and driving over .08. He argued that the investigating officer did not have reasonable and probable grounds to make a breath demand pursuant to s. 254(3) of the Criminal Code resulting in the arbitrary detention of the accused. The accused argued the Certificate of Analysis should be excluded. The officer responded to complaint of possible impaired driver weaving on the roadway and onto the sidewalk. The officer located vehicle with the same licence plate number. He observed the vehicle weaving from right to left in its lane. The vehicle braked suddenly and made right turn from the left lane. The officer activated his emergency equipment. The vehicle pulled over quickly but lurched forward and stopped abruptly as the officer walked towards the vehicle. The accused had glossy eyes, slurred speech, poor muscular control, difficulty extracting his licence and displayed poor balance when walking to the police vehicle. The officer did not note smell of alcohol. HELD: In this case, there was no dispute that the officer's belief in reasonable and probable grounds was honestly held and subjectively valid. While the officer could have asked the accused if he had been drinking alcohol, the weight to be given to any response from the officer was subjective Ã» he was not required to accept what he was told. Although it is possible to speculate that the symptoms of impairment in this case were caused by some medical condition, there is no evidence of any other possible explanation for the egregious driving and physical condition of the accused. In the absence of any evidence suggesting an alternative explanation, it is reasonable to conclude that the most obvious case was impairment by alcohol. The driving pattern and physical symptoms of the accused paint a stereotypical portrait of a motorist impaired by alcohol. The absence of a smell of alcohol or any admission of consumption does not vitiate the probative value of the other indicia when considered in their totality. In the face of the manner of driving and very significant symptoms of impairment, it would be ludicrous to suggest that the officer could only have had a reasonable suspicion that the accused had alcohol in his body. The Court found that the officer had reasonable and probable grounds. No charter breach was established. The certificate was not excluded.","The accused was charged with operating a motor vehicle while his ability to do so was impaired by alcohol or drug contrary to ss. 255(1) and 253(1)(a) of the Criminal Code, and with driving while over.08 contrary to s. 253(2) and 254(1),a of the Code. As counsel for the accused provided notice of his intention to raise certain Charter issues, the evidence of a third Crown witness was called on voir dire. His testimony is the only evidence left for the Court to consider in determining the Charter application. The accused asserts that he was arbitrarily detained as the officer did not have reasonable grounds to make a demand for a sample of his breath for analysis. HELD: The admission of the evidence would not bring the administration of justice into disrepute. The breach was not the result of wilful or blatant disrespect of the Charter by the officer. The impact on the accused was also at the lower end of the spectrum. Although the onus lies upon an accused to establish a Charter violation on a balance of probabilities, demand for breath samples amounts to a warrantless search which is prima facie unreasonable. The more serious the Charter breach the more likely the Court will be to disassociate from that conduct by weighing in favour of exclusion. 1) The officer subjectively believed that he had reasonable grounds, nor did he have the grounds to arrest for impaired driving, thus the arrest was unlawful, the detention was arbitrary, the breath samples unlawfully seized and the evidence thus obtained should be excluded from the Certificate of Analysis. 2) There was no dispute that the officer's belief was honestly held and subjectively valid. The only question is whether, in the absence of any smell of alcohol or admission of consumption of beverage alcohol, his belief can be verified objectively. 3) In balancing the three lines of evaluation directed in Grant, the Court concluded that there is a subjective and objective component to finding that reasonable grounds exist within the meaning of s. 254(3). The onus then lies on the Crown to establish that the search was authorized by law, the law was reasonable and the search conducted in reasonable fashion. In this case, there is no question that s.254(3) authorizes the search and is reasonable. No issue was taken with the authority of the officer to stop the vehicle."
4_1998canlii13643.txt,"The appellant sought an order quashing a decision of an adjudicator following a hearing pursuant to s. 62 of the Labour Standards Act. The Director of Labour Standards ordered the employer to pay $1,500 in lieu of a proper notice of termination. The grounds raised were that the adjudicator erred in law in finding the respondent had not frustrated or fundamently breached her employment contract; the adjudicator exceeded his jurisdiction by holding the employer had an obligation to attempt to resolve the workplace difficulties that prohibited the respondent from reporting to work. The employee had been charged with stealing three pencils on her way through a store to the salon where she worked. The Crown subsequently withdrew the shoplifting charges. She was prohibited from returning that the store and as there was no alternate entrance to the salon the employer treated the contract as frustrated or breached, therefore releasing him of any obligation to pay wages in lieu of notice. HELD: The appeal was dismissed with costs. 1)The adjudicator concluded the employer failed to meet the thresholds stipulated in O'Connell which set out the six essential elements for determining whether events had frustrated an employment contract: a critical rather than a trivial supervening event; an event protracted in time; not within the contemplation of the parties; coming about without fault on either party; an event that rendered the parties incapable of performing their contractual obligations; the performance of a contract would radically alter the original agreement into something other than that intended. The employer did not establish he was incapable of performing his obligations by permitting the employee access to the workplace.  2)The phrases 'patently unreasonable' and 'degree of deference' in a s63(1) appeal may have meanings materially different from those in a judicial review. 3)The hearing process before the adjudicator is not a highly specialized one. The correctness test was applicable to general questions of law. The adjudicator applied the appropriate principles of law to the facts as he found them. 4)The adjudicator acted within his jurisdiction when determining the terms of the employment contract and that the employer had not fulfilled his obligations.","The appellant sought an order quashing the adjudicator's decision following a hearing pursuant to s. 62.1 and 62.2 of The Labour Standards Act. The appellant's president did not examine his company's lease in order to determine whether the rights of access and egress were guaranteed to the applicant and her employees (which seems likely) and the employer were to ask the employer whether it was acting reasonably and to make the inquiry (just described) of the franchisor. HELD: The appeal was dismissed with costs. 1)The adjudicator applied the appropriate principles of law to the facts, as he found them. The grounds relied on by the appellant were not patently unreasonable because there was some evidence before him on which he could arrive at the same. 2)The employer did not engage in these further inquiries and efforts by the employer. It was not satisfied that the employer was incapable of carrying out its obligations. The adjudicator acted well within his jurisdiction when determining what the terms of the applicant's employment contract were and that Cajon had not fulfilled its obligations thereunder. Although not all of the facts presented to the court were known to this Court, his decision outlines some evidence uponwhich he could have arrived at his conclusions."
6_2002nsca46.txt,"The plaintiff appealed an interlocutory decision in which the chambers judge held that a non-party medical doctor who had provided emergency treatment to the plaintiff did not have to answer certain interrogatories on the basis that they required an opinion. The admitted purpose of the appellant was to use these answers as his expert evidence at trial. Appeal allowed in part; the chambers judge did not err in refusing to appoint the doctor as a court expert where he indicated that he did not wish to be an expert; the chambers judge did err in finding that opinion evidence is never required to be given. Opinions that go into the formation of the doctor's judgment in diagnosing and treating the appellant are to be provided. However, opinions typically asked of an expert witness with respect to the medical services provided by the respondent that were not formed as part of his diagnosis and treatment of the appellant are not required to be provided. Interrogatories cannot be used to usurp the Rules surrounding the use of expert evidence.","The appellant applied for leave to appeal and, if granted, to appeal the interlocutory order of Justice Simon J. MacDonald refusing to appoint a court expert and refusing to order the appellant to answer certain interrogatories, the majority of which call for his opinion concerning the medical services provided by the respondent. The appellant alleged negligence in the performance of the circumcision. The respondent did not attend the hearing and indicated by letter that he supported the appellant's position that the appellant should re-answer the interrogatories he previously objected to on the basis of opinion, but provided the names of three other urologists who were also referred to by the appellant and declined to act as expert witnesses. HELD: Leave to appeal was granted and the appeal was allowed in part.  1)The appellant was correct in stating that the chambers judge considered the issue of opinion and that he erred by overstating the basis upon which a non-party witness may object to answer an interrogatory calling for an opinion, even if this requires the physician to disclose the opinions that went into the formation of his judgment in diagnosing and treating the appellant. The distinction between fact and opinion may not be clear. The chambers judge erred in failing to provide proper notice to the parties of experts opinions to avoid surprise and help the trier of fact discover the truth.  2)To allow interrogatories to usurp this function, without the presence of such safeguards for the parties, the experts and the court, would not be in accordance with the orderly and fair trial practice and procedure that the Civil Procedure Rules promote.  3)Leave to appeal is granted and, in part as provided in the standard of review, the appellant is allowed to add a disbursement of the amount paid to the appellant for his attendance at discovery."
2002skqb68.txt,"An appeal from a summary conviction for unlawfully using a searchlight for the purpose of hunting. The trial judge made three distinct and alternate findings: based on the evidence presented, night hunting with an artificial light is so inherently dangerous as not to attract protection as an aboriginal right; based on the Sparrow test for prima facie infringement and justification, s.11.1(3) of the Regulations withstands both prima facie infringement and justifiability scrutiny; based on the authorities, s.11.1(3) of the Regulations does not touch the appellant's core as Indians and, therefore, does not give rise to interjurisdictional immunity. The trial judge found that aboriginal hunting rights must be exercised subject to any legislation that expresses legitimate safety concerns. The facts were not in dispute. The appellants, who were of Metis heritage and engaged in the traditional Metis way of life, argued they enjoy hunting rights within the meaning of s.12 of the Natural Resources Transfer Act and are exempt from any hunting prohibition when hunting on unoccupied Crown land. The respondent acknowledged that if they are Metis, they enjoy an aboriginal right to hunt for food as protected by s.35(1) of the Constitution Act, 1982. However, they are subject to the regulation prohibiting night hunting with artificial lights (except when hunting on a Reserve) because its primary objective is safety. At issue was whether the appellants, as Metis, are subject to s.11.1(3)of the Saskatchewan Regulations passed pursuant to the Wildlife Act. HELD: The appeal was dismissed. 1)The appellants failed to come within s.686(1)(a)(i) or (ii) of the Criminal Code. 2)The findings were supported by the evidence and were reasonable. There was no wrong decision on a question of law.  3)Aboriginal and Treaty rights are not absolute. Reasonable regulations aimed at ensuring safety do not infringe these rights. Laws having a safety objective do not infringe aboriginal rights. As safety legislation, s.13.1(3) has a conservation component. The Province has jurisdiction to pass conservation laws. Legislation prohibiting night hunting with artificial lights has been considered by the courts of several provinces. All courts found the practice dangerous and upheld the limiting provincial legislation. 4)The Court preferred the approach taken in R. v. Bernard, which is to consider safety as a factor in determining prima facie infringement and if necessary, justification pursuant to the Sparrow test. The issue in this case is whether the limiting legislation is a prima facie infringement on the appellants' right to hunt for food and if so, whether it is justifiable. Since Sparrow, it has become unnecessary and perhaps inappropriate to attempt to define aboriginal hunting rights. Sparrow presented three questions when deciding whether there has been a prima facie infringement of hunting rights: is the limitation reasonable; does the regulation cause undue hardship; does it deny their preferred means of exercising that right. In Seward and Bernard, the Sparrow test of infringement and justification was the only test applied. No infringement was found in either case. 5)The trial judge concluded the practice of night hunting by means of artificial light is highly dangerous. The prohibition was found not only to be reasonable but essential. The regulation presented no undue hardship and was never the preferred means of hunting by people of Sapwagamik. The legislation could not be considered a diminution of any assumed aboriginal right and there was thus no prima facie infringement of hunting rights by s.11.1(3).  6)It was not accepted that because Reserves are exempted, safety was not the primary purpose. Reserves were exempt out of respect for Band Council's right to pass their own safety laws pursuant to the Indian Act. 7)The trial judge correctly identified the test for justification of a legitimate regulation as being whether the legislation has a valid objective; whether the honour of the Crown is at stake; has there been as little infringement as possible; has the aboriginal group been consulted. 8)Section 11.1(3) restricts the method of hunting at night and to that extent it likely is a conservation infringement. If so, it is still permissible provincial legislation. It meets the Sparrow justification test because of the strong safety component. 9)Provincial hunting laws regulate aboriginal hunting rights; they do not extinguish them. Accordingly, such laws do not cross the interjurisdictional immunity boundary. They do not touch the core of Indians at the heart of s.91(24) of the Constitution. The regulation applies to appellants as hunters, not as Metis.","The appellants appealed their summary conviction for unlawfully using a searchlight for the purpose of hunting wildlife, contrary to s. 11.1(3) of the Saskatchewan Regulations passed pursuant to The Wildlife Act, 1998. The stated grounds of appeal were that the conviction was against the law, the evidence and the weight of the evidence; that the trial judge erred in law in holding that the appellants as Metis, within the meaning of s. 7 of the Constitution Act, 1867, did not have an Aboriginal right to hunt at night with searchlight; and that, given the evidence, it was unnecessary and perhaps inappropriate to attempt to define aboriginal hunting rights. The focus has shifted to the limiting legislation in both Aboriginal and Treaty hunting rights cases. The trial judge correctly identified the test for justification of a legitimate regulation of a constitutional aboriginal right, Sparrow, which was used in R. v. Grumbo and expanded in the subsequent authorities. The conclusion that night hunting with artificial lights was so inherently dangerous as not to attract protection as an aboriginal right was justifiable. The appellants had failed to show any error in law by applying the Sparrow test. HELD: The appeal was dismissed. It was not necessary to set aside the decision on the ground of a wrong decision on a question of law. The issue on this appeal was whether the regulations were a prima facie infringement of aboriginal rights and whether they were justifiable pursuant to Sparrow. 1)The objective was primarally safety, both from the words used in the legislation and the evidence introduced. The doctrine of interjurisdictional immunity was not triggered by the legislation. 2)The trial judge did go on (pages 27 to 32) to consider infringement and justification. That is where the safety purpose of the legislation ought to be considered. 3)The evidence did not show that the impugned regulation imposed an undue hardship on the Metis in general or in the context of Sapwagamik, but the Aboriginal group was consulted and their views were incorporated into at least one regulation amendment."

No authorities were available that considered its provisions. 3) Rule 18 requires the defendant to satisfy the court that he has not received notice of the document. 4) The defendant admits receiving a copy of the statement of claim by registered mail and the fact that it did not constitute valid service is of no assistance to him.,"FIAT. This was an application to set aside a noting for default and the resulting default judgment. The main ground of the application was that the service of the statement of claim on the defendant did not comply with Rule 19(1) of The Queen's Bench Rules. The defendant deposed that he received a registered letter on or about March 16, 2004 and believed that the receipt by way of registered mail did not constitute proper service. HELD: The application was dismissed. The Court had no alternative but to validate the earlier service upon the defendant be registered mail. The Rule must be read in conjunction with Rule 18. The relevant provisions of Rule 18 require that the applicant state the circumstances under which the default arose and disclose a defence on the merits."
2_2008nssm4.txt,"The Director of Residential Tenancies ordered compensation after he found that the landlord allowed mouldy conditions to develop in the premises and failed to rectify same, with the result that some of the tenant's belongings were ruined. The landlord appealed, taking the position that there had been no mould and the tenant had simply used grey spray paint to resemble mould. It was also questioned how the mould could only have affected the tenant's furniture and area rug but not be obvious on the other carpeting. Landlord's appeal dismissed; amount of damages ordered increased; the Director went too far in discounting the value of the tenant's belongings. The court relied on the by-law inspector's (who had been called in by the tenant) findings, finding it impossible to believe that he could have been fooled by something as amateurish as spray paint and that the tenant, had she actually resorted to such a tactic, would have called in a building inspector and hoped to get away with it.","This is an appeal from an order of the Director allowing the Tenant the sum of $787.50 against the Landlord as compensation arising from what the Director found to be a breach of the statutory condition to provide a premises suitable for habitation. The Landlord did not attend the hearing before the Director and it appears that she missed it inadvertently. The Tenant appeals. HELD: Appeal allowed. 1) The Director was essentially correct in her discounting of the value of the furniture and clothing. She went a little too far. She discounted the property damage claims on the basis that the furniture's value should be discounted, and because of the lack of evidence of the other items. She allowed $712.50 for the furniture, $75.00 for the area rug and $100 for the clothing. For a total of $862.50. 2) The damages are a little higher. The plaintiff's original claim of $1,000 was put on the balance of probabilities. She did not advance any stronger evidence of her original claim than her general claim, which was entirely speculative at the time of writing. She was only entitled to judgment against the landlord for that revised amount. There was no basis to rely on the bylaw inspector's findings. It was impossible to believe that he could have been fooled by something as amateurish as spray paint. Having heard and assessed the plaintiff as credible, it was hard to believe she would have engaged in such a tactic four years earlier."
9_1996canlii6888.txt,"The surviving spouse of the insured deceased, who died in a motor vehicle accident, took issue with the calculation of the death benefit paid for herself and her two children which had been reviewed and approved by SGI. At issue was whether the weekly income replacement benefit referred to in Division 5 of the Act had a separate and distinct meaning from the income replacement benefit in Division 4. HELD: SGI's decision was set aside and SGI was directed to recalculate and pay the death benefit to the surviving spouse and dependent children in accordance with the directions of the court.  1)The Interpretation Act requires legislation be given a fair, large and liberal construction to best assure the attainment of its objectives and that definitions given apply to the entire statute and regulations unless a contrary intention appears in the statute or regulations. 2)The phrase income replacement benefit (IRB) used in s136(1) is not analogous to the IRB in s146(1). There is no requirement to use the formula in s136(1) to calculate the surviving spouse's death benefit. S146(1) is a self-contained formula. 3)Because the Act is silent on a maximum yearly employment income the actual income earned is the sum that is used to determine the IRB in s146(1). The ordinary meaning of a death benefit being one-half the weekly IRB is that the payment is made on a weekly basis. 4)The IRB as calculated in s146(5) is the same as the IRB in s 146(1). 5)Leave was granted for the parties to bring the matter back, if required, with respect to the interest on benefits not paid.","The deceased's surviving spouse received a death benefit for herself and for her two children pursuant to the Automobile Accident Insurance Act. She took issue with the calculation of the death benefit, arguing that it was based on the deceased's gross income rather than on his gross income. SGI appealed the decision to the Court of Queen's Bench. HELD: The respondent's decision was set aside and the estate was directed to recalculate and pay the respondent the Death Benefit to her as a surviving spouse and her two dependent children in accordance with the directions of this Court. 1)SGI did not refer to the income replacement benefit in s.146(1) as it does in Division 4. The deceased was entitled to receive a lump sum payment of $45,000 for each child born after the accident. 2)The deceased received no benefit less than the $603 per week paid to her by SGI. The 'income replacement benefit' referred to in the Act is a self-contained formula. The meaning of this is that the payment is made to the survivor on a weekly basis."

HELD: The action was dismissed. 1)The tender package contained the usual privilege clause which stated the lowest tender need not be accepted. It is an implied term of the contract that the person inviting the tenders agrees to treat all tenders fairly and will not give any an unfair advantage.  2)The plaintiff had no experience in the type of pesticide spraying. It was not known at the time that the plaintiff made arrangements to hire an experienced subcontractor. The consultant hired to advise the defendant on the technical aspects of the project used reliable independent sources for his information about the operational viability of the planes. He followed common industry practice and conducted his investigation of the planes to be used by the plaintiff in a fair and impartial manner.  3)Discretion was exercised to deny costs because, while the plaintiff was treated fairly and the reason its tender was rejected was due to negative reports, the recommendation contained other reasons which led the plaintiff to believe it did not get fair treatment.","The defendant Government of Saskatchewan tendered a spruce bud worm aerial spraying program in northern Saskatchewan. Four companies submitted tenders in response to the defendant's invitation to tender. The plaintiff submitted the lowest tender which was awarded to another tenderer who had less experience in the area and got favourable reports. The Plaintiff sued for damages. HELD: The action was dismissed. 1)An implied term of the contract is that the person inviting the tenders agrees to treat all tenderers fairly and not give them an unfair advantage over the others. 2)Curniski used reliable independent sources for his information. The tender package contained the usual privilege clause: The lowest, or any tender need not be accepted by the defendant. This clause has the effect of relieving the defendant from accepting the second lowest tender for the project. No unfair advantage was given to Nielsen Ashdown in selecting the successful tenderer on the basis that it conducted its investigation fairly and in accordance with common industry practice.  3)Costs usually follow the result, but this was an appropriate case in which to exercise discretion to disallow costs to the successful party."
d_2009skqb44.txt,"The Ministry of Social Services seeks a 6 month order pursuant to s. 37(c) of The Child and Family Services Act with respect to the two children, NS is four years old and DS is two years old. DS was apprehended by the Ministry when he was born. Both NS and DS were the subject of a consent order for 6 months in October 2007. Both children have been in care for most of their lives. The Ministry requests a six month order with a proviso that it be for the purposes of allowing the Ministry to make long term placement plans for both children. The mother HH is not seeking a return of the children to her but supports the position of NOS, the father, who ask that the children be returned to him in his care. HELD: 1) If the children are returned to NOS, they will not receive a level of parenting that is above the minimal standard that will be tolerated by our society. Both children have some difficulties which must be managed carefully to ensure their continued growth and improvement. 2) Given the difficulties the parents struggle with, they can not provide that management. The Ministry has tendered substantial evidence of criminal activity on the part of NOS and police involvement in the life of HH. The criminal behaviour of NOS in and of itself would not disqualify him from parenting the children if the children were not exposed to that behaviour. There is a risk that the children may be exposed to such behaviour in the future. There is no evidence that NOS has done so in the past. The evidence of domestic violence is equivocal. There is evidence of consistent fighting and disruption of their relationship in the past. The Court finds that the relationship is unstable. The parents' addictions continue to loom large in their lives and relationship. The Court is not convinced that the father's addiction has been stabilized and is fully under control. There have been slip-ups and missed appointments at the methadone clinic. This should not be visited on the children. HH is even less advanced in dealing with her addictions than NOS. The evidence indicates good intentions but not the personal strength to take and complete programming whether offered by the methadone client, or ordered as a condition of the court. This is troubling because if the parents don't have the strength to achieve this, there is a question as to whether they have the personal strength to provide the minimal care for these children required by law on a day to day basis. 3) If the children are returned to NOS, they are likely to suffer physical and emotional harm. While the parents have had successful visits with the children while in care and had a period of some months where the children were apparently looked after by them, this does not convince the Court that they belong with NOS. The day to day stress of parenting is substantially different than visits of several hours. The evidence does not convince the Court that the children would receive consistent care month after month despite one past success in doing so. The children are in need of protection and should not be returned to NOS or HH. 4) Although the Ministry seeks a 6 month order with the notation that it is for the purposes of permanency planning, the Court is not inclined to make such an order. A 6 month order is premised on a reasonable prospect of change by the parents within a reasonable time. The parents have this opportunity to demonstrate that they are serious about changing their lives so that their children can be returned to them.","The Ministry of Social Services sought a six month order pursuant to s. 37(c) of The Child and Family Services Act with respect to the two children. HELD: The order was granted on the condition that it be for the purposes of allowing the Ministry to make long term placement plans for both children. The father asked that the children be returned to him immediately. Although H.H. was the mother, she supported the father who proposed that he continue living with the mother while the mother first attends to getting her addiction problems under control and then he would address his own addiction problems. The evidence from Mobile Services indicated that the father had been on methadone for most of his life and that he had a substantial criminal record, which included 16 offences as youth. The convictions for youth offences were primarily property crimes, especially vehicles and failures to comply with the dispositions made with regard to his offences. Both the father and the mother appeared at the hearing and both the mother and the father appeared to be familiar with each other's lives and were in good standing with the father. The mother testified that she had not seen the father for the past four or five months and was concerned about the father's failure to follow through with the parenting services and noncompliance with the PSA's. Although the father was apprehended by the Ministry when he was born, the mother had been involved with the child since the very beginning of the child's life and was the primary caretaker of the children and was able to assist the father in addressing his addiction issues. Although both children were in the care of the Ministry at the time of their birth, the father indicated that he was not seeking a return to her directly but supported the position of the father, who sought the children's return to him in his care. Both children had been in the Ministry since birth and both were in need of immediate, long term, and appropriate treatment. The permanency committee had explored resources with the understanding that the mother would attend a parenting program of their choice and would provide drug screens, participate in parenting instruction and provide all drug screen results, and would work with the Ministry on a parenting assessment and assessment basis with the assistance of a Harm Reduction Methadone Program counsellor. Both mother and father have substantial criminal records, some of which were tendered as ex parte releases. H.O.S.’s criminal record consisted of 16 youth offences, mostly property offences but also of failure to provide quality programming and support the parents with addiction counselling and support"
6_2014skpc40.txt,"Criminal Law – Recognizance The defendant was a repeat violent and sexual offender who was still serving a sentence for sexual assault and out on a weekend parole pass when he committed his last sexual assault offence against his 14-year-old niece. He was returned to prison and served his entire sentence to warrant expiry before being placed on a s. 810.1 peace bond recognizance upon his release from prison in 2010 and then again in 2012. The Crown then applied for a third recognizance. An RCMP officer with the High Risk Offender/Serious Violent Offender Response Unit swore an Information that he had reasonable grounds to believe that the defendant would commit either a serious personal injury or a sexual assault offence against someone under the age of 16 years and requested that he be bound over. A parole officer with Correctional Services Canada also testified to the defendant’s history in the federal prison and to her belief that based, upon his history, the defendant remained at high risk to re-offend. The Crown indicated that it was looking for one recognizance, either under s. 810.2 or s. 810.1 of the Criminal Code. The defendant had 59 prior criminal convictions, 12 of which related to sexual or common assaults. He had a serious alcohol abuse problem and committed most of the assaults while intoxicated. While in prison, he had refused to participate in programming. As a high risk to re-offend for sexual offending, the defendant was required to complete high-intensity sex offender programming but had not availed himself of the opportunity to do so during the last four years. HELD: The Court granted the recognizance to bind the defendant over to keep the peace and be of good behaviour pursuant to s. 810.2 of the Code because it agreed with the beliefs and opinions expressed by the witnesses and their evidence that they believed that he would re-offend in a violent or sexual manner, which posed an imminent danger to public safety.","The accused is a repeat violent and sexual offender who was still serving a sentence for sexual assault and out on a weekend parole pass when he committed his last sexual assault offence against his 14 year old niece. He was returned to prison and served his entire sentence to warrant expiry before being placed on s. 810.1 peace bond recognizance in 2010 and then again in 2012. The Crown now applies for third recognition. HELD: The accused is granted a security deposit.  1) The Court found that an objective person armed with the same knowledge would agree that the fears of Corporal Teniuk, the RCMP officer in charge of the High Risk Offender Response Unit and Ms. Woytiuk's testimony that she has had the same subjective and objective fear that he will commit either a serious personal injury offence or sexual assault of someone under the age of 16 years and that her experiences as a parole officer and as a result of his release from prison are reasonable. 2) The accused has 59 prior criminal convictions. He entered the criminal justice system at a young age. He continued to re-offend and became entrenched there. There was no de-escalation in the violence, drugs and alcohol he suffered while incarcerated. There were no less than 20 failures to comply with lawful court orders. The three escapes from lawful custody are important as they provide an insight to the accused's degree of impulsivity and inability to telegraph his behaviour. The accused's security risks can either be downgraded or upgraded based upon his actions while in prison. There is a reasonably grounded fear of serious and imminent danger that the accused is more likely than not to commit an offence."

HELD: The appeals against conviction and sentence were dismissed. The judge made no error in ruling that all of the evidence from the prospective witnesses and transcripts was irrelevant as being unrelated to the charges and too remote in time. The appellant's state of mind was adequately established by his own evidence and the summation to the jury. The defence was fully and fairly put to the jury which chose not to accept it.

All of the members of the Court read your notice of appeal, the relevant portions of the transcript of the trial proceedings, and the Crown factum prior to hearing your arguments. HELD: The appeal was dismissed.  1)Our view was that the judge had made no error in ruling that all of the evidence to be derived from these sources was irrelevant to the charges against you, being unrelated to the charge which were subject matter of trial, and being unnecessary to establish a state of mind which was adequately established by your own evidence and your summation to the jury. 2)Your state of Mind at the time you made the telephone calls which were the subject of the charges somehow exonerated you from responsibility for them.

One of the defendants, Dow Chemical, sought a declaration that the Court of Queen's Bench did not have jurisdiction to hear the action and to have the service ex juris set aside. Dow Chemical argued that there was no causal connection between it and the plaintiff's damages. HELD: The application was dismissed. The plaintiff was awarded her taxable costs in any event of the cause. It must be assumed that the allegations have a factual basis and liability may rest with the defendant, Dow Chemical, in both tort and contract, therefore it was considered appropriate to assume jurisdiction.  1)The Court did not have jurisdiction over the defendant on the basis of common law. The defendant is not resident in Saskatchewan and has no direct or real connection to the province. 2)The plaintiff is assumed to have suffered damages in both contract and tort. Applying Queen's Bench Rule 31(l)(f)(g) and the Moran case, the Court should assume jurisdiction absent any reason to the contrary. 3)Three of the four main topics in the statement of claim have reference to Dow Chemical: the failure to inform certain regulatory bodies and the public at large about the risk of breast implants; marketing and distributing the implants which were of non-merchantable quality and breach of warranties. 4)The final plea was that Dow Corning and Dow Chemical were in reality one and the same entity. It was thus suggested that the corporate veil should be pulled aside and any wrongful acts of Dow Corning should be treated as those of Dow Chemical. This differs significantly from vicarious liability where no fault is attributable to the third party but liability attaches because of the relationship. If fault were found to be directly attributable to Dow Chemical there would be a causal connection. 5)The allegation that Dow Chemical breached its duty to disclose the inherent risk suggested a link between the alleged failure to disclose and the injuries.  6)The doctrine of forum non conveniens was not invoked and therefore not considered. Appeal to Court of Appeal dismissed Sept. 9/96.","The plaintiff underwent bilateral augmentation mamoplasty and received silicone breast implants manufactured by Dow Corning Canada Inc. (Dow Chemical). Ten years later she received replacement breast implants, bearing the trade name Surgitek, which were manufactured by Medical Engineering Corporation and Bristol-Myers Squibb Company. In 1992 she had the breast implants removed. The plaintiff now suffers from fibromyalgia, chronic fatigue and a persistent immune mediated skin rash. She is also alleged that her condition is a result of negligence attributed to the defendants. The defendant denies the allegations. HELD: The statement of claim was dismissed. The Court held that it did not have jurisdiction over the defendant on the basis of common law. 1)There was no causal connection between the defendant, Dow Chemical, and the plaintiff's damages. Rather, the pleadings portray nothing more than a relationship akin to that of vicarious liability, between the defendants, the Dow Chemical Company and one of the other defendants, namely, Dowcorning Corporation. 2)The defendant is not resident in Saskatchewan and has no direct or real connection to the province. As result, that defendant cannot be served with the Statement of Claim within the territorial jurisdiction of this Court. 3)The plaintiff is suggesting that the corporate veil should be pulled aside and any wrongful acts of the defendant Corning Corporation should be treated as being those of the DowChemical Company. There are allegations which I must assume have a factual basis. Applying Queen's Bench Rule 31(1)(f) and (g) and following what was stated in Moran v. Pyle National (1975) S.C.R. 393, this Court should assume jurisdiction absent any reason to the contrary, although any uncertainty or doubt is to be resolved in favour the defendant."

The court found that the bankrupt was 43 years old, in good health and with no dependents. The bankrupt was also a self-employed contractor with an 'enviable' income.

He was a self-employed contractor and had an enviable income. HELD: The bankrupt could accommodate a payment of $500 per month for three years without jeopardizing his ability to pay toward his current tax obligations. 1)The trustee calculated surplus income of $435 per month and recommended a conditional order. It would take approximately 18 months to complete the terms of the order. The objecting creditor was entitled to costs of $400 out of the estate. 2)The court carefully reviewed the financial material on file and considered the submissions of the parties. 3)A conditional order was ordered requiring the bankrupt to make regular instalment payments on his self-employment income and comply with income and GTS filing requirements.  4)The bankrupt preferred the recommendation of the trustee. It should come as no surprise that Revenue Canada was also the major creditor in the first bankruptcy.

The Crown appealed the conviction, the conviction and the fine imposed upon them by the trial judge. Allowing the appeals and setting aside the convictions, that s. 174 (now s. 193) was in breach of the Charter because it completely relieves the Crown of any requirement whatsoever to prove accuracy of the scales.

The applicant claimed special monthly expenses of $1,200 to cover nanny and child care costs, $125 for medication, $25 for recreation and $200 for a university fund. HELD: 1)The respondent was to pay $1,794 per month. Section 4 of the guidelines was applicable. The significant income of the applicant is a factor to be taken into consideration. 2)The applicant did not establish that the claims for recreation and the university fund were expenses that were 'special' or 'extra-ordinary'. 3)The respondent was responsible for 2/3 of the nanny and child care costs which were justified pursuant to s7(1)(c) of the guidelines.","The only issue to be determined in this application was the amount of monthly maintenance to be paid by the respondent pursuant to s.7 of the Divorce Act Regulations SOR/97-175 (the Federal Child Support Guidelines).

e_2015skqb345.txt,HELD: The court granted summary judgment for the defendants. It held that it could determine the defendants’ application prior to the plaintiffs’ application for certification. The court found that the facts were not in dispute and there was no evidence that the plaintiffs or any members of the proposed class had suffered any damages. The plaintiffs’ argument that it was misleading to label identical products differently was not supported by their pleadings or any affidavit evidence. There was no genuine issue requiring a trial. The court reviewed the various alleged breaches of statute and dismissed them. It was not necessary to decide the application for certification.,"The original plaintiff issued his claim under The Class Actions Act for breach of consumer protection and sale of goods legislation, breach of warranty, negligence the Competition Act and waiver of tort. The claim seeks to recover damages on behalf of those who purchased the defendants' 'Low Sodium' beverages (the 'Class' or 'Class Members'), but ultimately received beverages which were no lower or not appreciably lower in sodium than other, non-Low Sodium beverages. The defendants claim that they should receive summary judgment in favour of their claim is clearly without merit. There is no evidence that the plaintiffs were misled about the sodium content of the drink they purchased, nor did they rely upon the low sodium label when making the purchase and find they did not suffer any damages. HELD: The application for summary judgment was dismissed. 1)The plaintiff admitted that the defendants knowingly leveraged the national awareness campaign for sodium-reduction among Canadians, misrepresented its product as 'low sodium' versus the other in its category and misled consumers into purchasing its product based on this claim. There will be no genuine issue requiring trial in this case. The Court will continue to hear summary judgment application before having to decide the plaintiffs' application for certification.  2)The Court was comfortable with following this judicial authority and determining the defendant's summary judgement application prior to making the plaintiff's application for dismissal. It is only the named plaintiffs that would be subject to this dismissal. There was no application before the Court with respect to the claims as a class as whole. It would be potentially open for other representative plaintiffs to come forward by issuing a new claim under the CMA."

They attended trade show and met the defendant, whose corporation had been in the business of building decks and sunrooms for 18 years. The plaintiffs contracted with the defendant to build their sunroom. The contract called for the provision of ten-foot deep, ten inch diameter concrete pilings to be the foundation for the deck upon which would sit glass sunroom. This provision was fundamental element in the contract. The type and design of the foundation was critical to the mutual satisfaction of both parties and the overall success of the installation in both the short and long term. The contract was frustrated when it was discovered that the intended foundation could not be constructed due to the high ground water in the town of Warman and specifically on the job site.  The plaintiffs sued the defendant for the return of their $2,200.00 deposit. The defendant filed a dispute note and counterclaimed for a balance they believed was owed to them of $3,604.13. HELD: There will be a judgment in favour of the plaintiffs against the defendant in the amount of $176.22. In the circumstances, there will be no order as to costs. Based on the facts and the applicable law, the contract was frustrated. The frustrating event or circumstance occurred after the formation of the contract. It was not reasonably foreseeable by either party. The change affected the fundamental nature of the contract. The event was permanent and non-transient. The contract as a result would be totally different from what the parties intended. The difference was much more than mere inconvenience. The supervening event was beyond the control of both parties and resulted in a significant change in the original obligation assumed by them. Both parties acted in good faith. The plaintiffs submitted that the defendant abandoned the contract. The court finds that the plaintiff has failed to prove that claim on a balance of probabilities. The defendant, in its counterclaim, submitted that the plaintiffs repudiated the contract. The court finds that the defendant (plaintiff in the counterclaim) failed to prove that claim on a balance of probabilities. Considering all the facts presented in the case, the court finds that a just and reasonable resolution demands that the value of the expenses lost due to the frustration of the contract should be borne by the parties on a 65/35 ratio: the defendant should bear 65% of the loss, and the plaintiffs should bear 35% of the loss. The plaintiffs and the defendant were not on an equal plane. The plaintiffs relied on the contractor's experience to some degree, although not entirely. The defendant corporation may be able to further mitigate its losses over the course of time by using more parts salvaged from the material left over in the failed project. Further, the corporation will be able to write off this loss over the course of time.","The plaintiff and his wife sued the defendant corporation for the return of a deposit they gave to the defendant. The defendant corporation was in the business of building decks and sunrooms and had been for 18 years.

Both parties acted in good faith. The contract was frustrated when it was discovered that the intended foundation could not be constructed due to high ground water in the town of Warman and specifically on the Ens job site. The dispute note awarded the defendant $176.22 for the sum of $2,200.00 paid by cheque and $400.00 received by the plaintiff. In addition, the defendant filed a dispute note and became a defendant in the Counterclaim against the plaintiff for recovery of the amount of $3,604.13. HELD: The plaintiff in the counterclaim failed to prove the claim on a balance of probabilities.  1) Every party is entitled to restitution of benefits conferred by that party's performance or part performance under the contract on another party prior to the frustration of the contract. 2) A just and reasonable resolution demands the value of the expenses lost due to the frustrated contract should be borne by the parties in a 65/35 ratio. 3) Considering all the facts presented in the case the Court found that the contract must be resolved based on the distinction between complete fruitlessness and mere inconvenience. The disruption must be permanent, not temporary or transient. The cost of preparing detailed designs and drawings for both the client's order and the application for building permit. 4) The court found that it was not reasonably for the Court to find that the plaintiff and defendant corporations were on an equal plane because the plaintiff had more experience in constructing glass sunrooms but the defendant relied on the contractors experience to some degree. The Court awarded the plaintiff $1,000,000 in damages and set aside the defendant's claim of misappropriation of the $96,961.96 as damages."

b_1998canlii971.txt,"The respondent grocery store was charged with selling tobacco to a person under the age of 19, contrary to s. 5(1) of the Tobacco Access Act. The actus reus of the act was clearly proved at trial. The trial judge acquitted as a result of his finding that the legislation was ultra vires the Province. He reasoned that federal legislation had 'occupied the field' with the Tobacco Act, that the federal legislation cannot stand side by side with the provincial legislation, and that the federal legislation therefore prevails. The trial judge further commented that, had the Act been constitutional, he would have convicted because he did not accept the accused's defence of due diligence. The Crown appealed, and the accused cross-appealed. Allowing the appeal and remitting the matter to Provincial Court for trial, that the Tobacco Access Act is legislation in relation to matters of health, and therefore within provincial jurisdiction. It does not conflict with the federal Tobacco Act. The trial judge therefore erred in finding that the Tobacco Access Act was ultra vires. The trial judge also erred in law with respect to the defence of due diligence. The question is not, as the trial judge thought, whether the employee who sold the tobacco was duly diligent, but whether the accused, her employer, exercised all reasonable care by establishing a proper system to prevent the commission of the offence, and by taking all reasonable steps to ensure the effective operation of the system.","The respondent was acquitted on a charge that it sold tobacco or a tobacco product to a person under the age of 19 years contrary to s. 5(1) of the Tobacco Access Act. The trial judge found that federal legislation had 'occupied the field' with the Tobacco Act and that it 'cannot stand side by side with the provincial legislation'. Having found the legislation to be unconstitutional, an acquittal was entered. The Crown appealed. Dismissing the appeal, that the trial judge erred in finding the provincial Statute unconstitutional. The proper method of analysis in this case has three steps. First, it is necessary to determine the matter, or the 'pith and substance' of each of the federal and provincial laws. As for the federal legislation, it has been assumed by both parties that it is in pith and Substance criminal law as decided in relation to its predecessor statute by majority of the Supreme Court of Canada in RJR-Macdonald Inc. v. Attorney General of Canada, 1995 CanLII 64. The question will be whether the act took place without the accused's direction or approval and whether the accused exercised all reasonable care by establishing a proper system to prevent and control the commission of the offence and by taking reasonable steps to ensure the effective operation of the system."
7_1995canlii4340.txt,"The respondent was convicted at trial with illegal blood alcohol level while operating a motor vehicle. The police had stopped the respondent when they observed the passenger putting on a seat belt. When the respondent went to the police cruiser, the police observed signs of impairment. The summary conviction appeal court held the stop was random and constituted an arbitrary detention infringing the respondent's s.9 Charter rights. The Crown appealed. Allowing the appeal and restoring the conviction. Random stops are arbitrary detentions infringing the Charters. 9 but are saved by s.1. They are authorized in Nova Scotia under Motor Vehicle Act provisions. In the course of checking licences, registration, insurance policy and mechanical condition police are justified in making observations to detect drinking drivers; the right to counsel under s. 10(b) is suspended during this period.","The respondent was convicted of driving with an illegal blood alcohol level after trial. His summary conviction appeal was allowed on the basis that he had been arbitrarily detained contrary to s. 9 of the Charter and that his right to counsel under s. 10(b) was infringed. The Crown appealed on the ground that the trial judge erred respecting arbitrary detention and the exclusion of evidence of the breathalyzer test. The respondent's lawyer had argued that his s. 8 Charter rights had been breached. Dismissing the appeal, that s. 189a(1) of the Highway Traffic Act is a valid and constitutional legislative enactment. The flexible approach strikes the proper balance between Parliament's objective in combatting the evils of drinking and driving, on the one hand, and the rights of citizens to be free from unreasonable search and seizure. It would entirely defeat the purpose of Parliament to require the police to administer the screening test immediately in circumstances where the results would be rendered totally unreliable and flawed."

The accused took no position. HELD: The Court dismissed the application. Making an order for video-conferencing for non- participating persons was not permitted because the Court had no control over the policing of the courtroom in Ontario. It would set a dangerous precedent that could result in multiple applications being made in future trials by numerous interested parties in different jurisdictions over which the Court had no control.","The applicant Government of Saskatchewan, Victim Services Branch, brought a motion before the Court as trial judge for an order permitting a live audio/video broadcast from a Court of Queen's Bench courtroom in Saskatoon to a courtroom in a court house in the Greater Toronto area for the exclusive benefit of the family of the deceased.

What would happen if family member did not comply with any order made by the Court? HELD: This application is both novel and unprecedented. Saskatchewan has developed protocol for accommodating the participants of the trial including witnesses, lawyers and judges within the trial process by way of video conferencing. The Court was presented with no case authority in which court has made an order allowing video confcing for the benefit of specific non-participating persons within Saskatchewan let alone another province.

The accused had previously applied to a Provincial Court judge, who had declined the accused's application. The issue was whether the Youth Court judge in Provincial Court had the jurisdiction to hear and determine the accused's application for judicial interim release.

The Provincial Court declined the accused's application on the grounds that he's presence in the community awaiting trial would erode the public's confidence in the administration of justice. The Crown asked for a determination of two preliminary issues: 1) whether the Youth Court judge in Provincial Court had jurisdiction to hear and determine the application for judicial interim release; and 2) if so, whether this honourable court has jurisdiction to conduct review of the youth court judge's decision.

9_2011skpc15.txt,"The accused was charged with aggravated assault and mischief. The evidence on the aggravated assault was that the accused had struck the victim in the face with a plastic candle holder. The victim suffered significant injury to his face and eye, which was still noticeable 6 weeks later. The victim testified that the accused had been drinking and the parties got into an argument. The victim touched the accused on the back in an effort to calm her down and she spun around and struck the victim in the face with the candle holder. The accused gave a warned statement and testified at trial that she believed she had backhanded the victim with her fist. In her warned statement, she qualified her denial by saying that her recollection was not clear and that she didn't really remember. The evidence on the mischief was that when the police attended to the residence after the victim had gone by ambulance to hospital and the accused was standing in front of the house in front of a broken window. HELD: The accused was convicted of aggravated assault. The inescapable conclusion from the evidence is that the accused struck the victim in the face with the candle holder. The accused's version that she struck the victim with her fist is not believable when considered in the context of her qualified denials about hitting him with the candle holder, her level of intoxication and the significance of the injury inflicted on the victim. When an individual intentionally strikes another in the face with a hard plastic object, it is objectively foreseeable that wounding, maiming or disfiguring of the victim may result. The accused was acquitted of the mischief charge because there was no direct evidence that she had broken the window and there was no evidence that the window was not broken prior to the offence date.","The accused was charged with mischief under $5,000.00 by smashing a window and with aggravated assault. The major issue for the Court was whether the accused could be convicted of both the charge of mischief and aggravated assault and whether she should have been convicted of assault causing bodily harm. HELD: The Court found the accused guilty of both charges. The Court stated that the Crown has not proved the requisite intent to sustain convictions under s. 267 or s. 268 of the Code. As far back as the case of R. v. Lepaski, [1989] S.C.R. 844, the Court spoke of the intent required for various assault provisions. The accused was convicted of mischief. In this case, the accused intentionally structured Mr. Cwynar in the face with a hard plastic object. There is circumstantial evidence that she broke the window. However, the evidence falls short of proof beyond a reasonable doubt. The injuries could have been inflicted by a single backhanded blow."

The Commission overturned the decision of the stewards and restored the horse declared to be in first place. In issue was whether the hearsay opinions of stewards from other jurisdictions were admissible; whether the Commission exceeded its jurisdiction by overturning the steward's decision to disqualify the horse; whether the Commission breached the rules of natural justice by failing to give notice of the hearing to the applicants. The respondents contended the privative clause in the Act gives the Commission the right to interpret the notice provisions of its empowering statute subject only to judicial review on the patently unreasonable standard. HELD: The application was allowed and the decision of the Commission was quashed. The matter was remitted to the Commission to be dealt with according to law after the appropriate notices have been given to the applicants. 1)The opinions were not only inadmissible as hearsay but were irrelevant to the present proceedings.  2)The law is well established that the Court in certiorari proceedings is restricted to determining whether or not the inferior statutory tribunal acted within its jurisdiction or there is an error on the face of the record. The evidence adduced at a hearing is not part of the record.  3)The provisions in both the rules of the Saskatchewan Liquor and Gaming Authority for the conduct of horse racing and the Alcohol and Gaming Regulation Act clearly entitle the Commission to overturn a decision of the stewards based on the Commission's own assessment of the evidence. The stewards were not vested with the sole authority to determine whether there was interference at the gate. 4)Knight v. Indian Head School Division set out that the existence of a general duty to act fairly on the part of a public authority depends on three factors: the nature of the decision, the relationship between the body and the individual, and the effect of the decision on the individual. 5)A miscarriage of justice occurred because the Commission did not give adequate or any notice to the applicants and failed to give them an opportunity to make submissions.

The applicants were the owners of two horses that were involved in a $15,000stakes race that comprised the sixth race on that day's card and featured a field of eight horses. The horses were moved up in the standings as a result of the result. The decision of the Commission was patently unreasonable. The applicants argued that the tribunal whose decision was under review had failed to inquire into certain evidence and had made incorrect factual findings based on the evidence. HELD: The application was allowed. The matter was remitted back to the Commission to be dealt with according to law after the appropriate notices have been given to the applicants. 1) Did the Commission Breach the Rules of Natural Justice by Failing to Give Notice of the Hearing to the Applicants? Such information is irrelevant to the questions which are before this Court on judicial review. 2) The Commission's decision to refuse to give notice of the hearing is patently unreasonably unreasonable. 3) The evidence adduced at a hearing is not part of the record and the Court cannot review the evidence as to whether they were correctly or erroneously made."

He also made a restitution order in the amount of $24,000. The Crown appeals asking that a 12 month conditional sentence be imposed with a condition of 200 hours of community service. HELD: Appeal allowed orally. 1) The learned judge failed to give proper consideration to the public interest criterion in s. 730(1) of the Code. The sentence imposed did not properly reflect the principle of deterrence or the gravity of the offence. 2) This was a serious fraud accomplished by what the judge called a rather intricate kiting system.","The accused was convicted, after trial, of fraud exceeding five thousand dollars. He wrote a cheque for $11,000 on his personal bank account in February 2001, knowing that the account lacked sufficient funds. He deposited the money into his CIBC Visa account and the next day withdrew $13,000 from the account. The next day, he deposited the $20,000 into his bank account, depositing it in a different account and withdrawing the $24,000 in cash. This was a serious fraud accomplished by virtue of what the Provincial Court judge called a rather intricate kiting system. It involved some 37 different creditors interested in his affairs. The Crown took issue with the discharge and asked that a 12 month conditional sentence be imposed with a condition of 200 hours of community service work. HELD: Leave to appeal was granted and the Crown's appeal was allowed. A conditional sentence was substituted in place of the conditional discharge. The accused was 28 years old at the time of sentencing. He had no criminal record and pre-sentence report suggested that he was low risk to re-offend.

The plaintiff alleged the contract price was in error and sought rectification of the contract. The commissioned salesman who was examined as the proper officer of the plaintiff gave evidence at the examination for discovery that he did not communicate the prices listed on his pricing sheet to the defendants but was adamant at trial that he had. HELD: The claim for rectification was dismissed. 1)The testimony of the president and general manager was not accepted. He signed the company's standard agreement which indicated that the price of the basement was included in the agreement. The salesman's evidence that he provided an approximate price contradicted his own notations and the notation was consistent with the evidence of the defendants.  2)A party seeking rectification must establish that the parties were of one mind as to the terms of the contract and the written record does not properly record that common intention. 3)The evidence was not clear as to when an interest rate of 15% was inserted into the document and the court was not satisfied that there was an agreement to pay interest. The plaintiff was entitled to interest pursuant to the Pre-judgment Interest Act on the claim for extras to the contract. 4)The claim for the extras was never in dispute.

The plaintiff alleged the contract price stipulated in the agreement was in error and sought rectification. HELD: The plaintiff's claim for rectification was dismissed. The court cannot accept the plaintiff's version of events.  1) The defendant knew the price of the RTM did not come with a basement. It is the practice of the plaintiff to price an RTM and basement separately if a prospective purchaser seeks to have the plaintiff provide a basement as well as the basement. 2) The plaintiff is entitled to interest pursuant to the Pre-judgment Interest Act on $1,716.28.  3) The evidence was not clear as to when an interest rate of 15% wasinserted into the document and the Court was not satisfied that there was an agreement reached."

HELD: By fiat of December 5, 2003, the Court dismissed the application for injunctive relief with reasons to follow. These are those reasons. 1) The wrongs the plaintiff says it will suffer at the hands of the defendant employees result from the decision of the defendant to expand its business from one dealing with educational supplies, office products and furniture to one involving the supply and service of business machines. The new direction brings the defendants into direct competition with the plaintiff's business. 2) The defendants hired Garry Huntington once his non-competition agreement with the plaintiff expired. The defendants also placed ads in newspapers and hired some 30 employees of the plaintiff. The plaintiff was concerned that the departing employees would take with them confidential information and that it would have difficulty hiring replacements, which would affect its ability to service its clients. 3) The departing employees gave 2 weeks notice. The plaintiff failed to demonstrate that it was entitled to more than 2 weeks notice. 4) The affidavit materials filed by the plaintiff provided no evidence of competition or solicitation or imminent danger or threat of such by the defendants. The defendant instructed its employees by memorandum to comply with the plaintiff's requests and guidelines for the duration of their respective notice periods. 5) There was no evidence at all that the defendants induced employees or solicited the plaintiff's clients through them or induced the plaintiff's employees to break any obligations they owed the plaintiff.","The applicant sought interlocutory injunctive relief on a quia timet basis and to enforce what the applicant says are restrictive covenants, obligations of confidentiality and fiduciary duty binding on the respondents. HELD: The application was dismissed with costs.  1) The applicant failed to demonstrate a prima facie case or even a serious issue to be tried that it was in law entitled to more than two weeks notice or that the respondents were in breach of any right which accrued to Danka.  2) The court did not infer bad faith on the part of the respondents in the face of their specific denials of solicitation. Rather, it was evident that the applicant accepted the resignations without protest or comment. The submission by Danka that despite its ejection of the employees from its premises they remained employees is neither borne out by the facts nor the truth of the circumstances. 3) There is no evidence of competition or solicitation nor of threats of violence. The respondent put at least some of its former employees on notice of what its expectations were with respect to confidentiality and competition. It is important to establish that the employment contracts are valid and binding and that the two year non-compete covenant is enforceable. 4) Injunctive relief until trial is necessary to protect Danka against irreparable damage and loss, mere inconvenience not being enough. In the absence of a factual foundation to provide credence for Danka's fear that wrongs will be done, the relief quia tat requires the applicant to establish a strong primae case of imminent danger of substantial damage.  5) Danka has failed to establish the factual base of the impugned conduct it says constitutes the unlawful interference with Danka’s existing legal rights.  6) The affidavits filed by the respondent employees all lead to the conclusion there has been no activity which could constitute the breaches referred to by the applicant in its memorandum. However, the respondent has made it clear that it has no obligation to disclose or make use of confidential or proprietary information. The employment agreements exhibited to her affidavit simply state: The employer or employee may terminate employee's employment with or without cause upon written notice. The existence of this directive will not prevent Brennan Office Plus from advertising your availability to the market or otherwise making known that you have joined the Brennan office Plus team. If, as a result of such promotion, business is attracted from your former Danka customers, you will be free to accept such business.

e_2015skqb412.txt,"HELD: The application was dismissed. The court held that the request for an assessment was not fair to the defendant and would not be in the interests of justice. The court reviewed the factors set out in Machula v. Kuse and found that the applicant had failed to provide the specific information required to direct an assessment of six years of legal services covering a multitude of issues on a substantial number of files. The court distinguished the applicant from the case of Vo v. Phillips Legal Profession Corp. because the defendant was not an unsophisticated client. The length of time was unusual, which would further support the need for clearly outlined reasons to justify going back six years. Further, the applicant had not made any complaints to the defendant even during the post-election period and had assured him that he would be paid. The defendant would be severely prejudiced by the assessment requested because of the time that it would take him from his practice to review six years of billings on hundreds of attendances. The applicant had not provided any properly supported allegations of misrepresentation, fraud or dereliction of duty by the defendant, whereas there was plenty of evidence that his legal services were effective and appreciated.","The applicant applies pursuant to s. 67 of The Legal Profession Act for an assessment of all bills for legal services that Brabant and Company Law Office have rendered to the applicant within six years of the date of the application. The application proceeded in March 2015. HELD: The application is dismissed.  1) The length of time between the appointment of a bill for assessment and the application is outside of the 30 day time period provided by ss. 67(1)(a)(i) of the Act which establishes an assessment as a matter of right. It appears that payment of the accounts which were paid were accomplished by cheque after bill, as opposed to payment from trust or from settlement proceeds. There are accounts outstanding that have not been paid in full, totaling $53,059.71. Even after the 2013 change of leadership the agreement with Cowessess carried on for some time. This is a general complaint based on the totality of legal fees and it is not fair to extend the time beyond the 30 days for any assessment. 2) The affidavit of Ms. Tanner was filed late, in contravention of Justice Kovach's timetable, even if it is considered it adds little value. She was not a Council member at the relevant time and relies on hearsay from current legal counsel and others. The information presented is not from her own direct observations and conflicts with the evidence provided from sources who had the opportunity to directly observe. It is not sufficient to make general complaint that the services seem to represent a large sum and expect them to thereafter be scrutinized in detail. 3) Any misrepresentation, fraud or dereliction of duty by the solicitor in this regard is not supported by the evidence. The evidence put forward here is vague, general in nature and inaccurate. It cannot be presumed that the client could effectively gather together the information on all of the matters he provided legal services in relation to so as to explain each item in an assessment."
8_1990canlii4256.txt,"Where a child's testimony as to repeated acts of sexual assault was not accurate as to precise details of the time and place of the events, but was otherwise reasonable and consistent, the inexactitude did not destroy the child's credibility. Evidence of an expert specializing in recognizing symptoms of child sexual abuse was admissible evidence to assist the trial judge in assessing whether an assault took place. However, evidence of the complainant's school counsellor was inadmissible as hearsay, but notwithstanding, its admission was not so grave an error as to call for a quashing of the conviction. The conviction was determined to have been a verdict which a jury acting judicially could reasonably have rendered.","The appellant was convicted of sexually assaulting his stepdaughter. The complainant testified that her stepfather had touched her breasts and inside her pants on numerous occasions. The Crown called a social worker as a witness. She testified that she was home every Friday night with the appellant. Dismissing the appeal, that the trial judge erred in allowing such evidence and as treating it as relevant to the complainant's credibility if, in fact that is what he actually did. The question then was whether the admission of the hearsay evidence was an error so grave as to call for a quashing of the conviction. After consideration of the entire record, it was concluded that it did not."
c_1996canlii5615.txt,"The appellant appealed his sentence of five months in prison to be followed by 18 months probation following his plea of guilty to the theft of his grandmother's car. Crown counsel acknowledged that this type of case would generally attract a suspended sentence with probation but for negative information in the pre-sentence report, which the appellant had not seen prior to sentencing. The appellant argued that he had seen the errors of his ways, was seeking employment, was truly remorseful, and had apologized to his grandparents, who were paying for the appeal in the hope of keeping him out of jail. The appellant was allowed to file affidavits as to the his progress concerning his problems with drugs and alcohol. Per Pugsley, J.A., Flinn, J.A. concurring, allowing the appeal and ordering a suspended sentence subject to terms, that the sentence imposed was not fit, and that it was not in society's interest that the appellant should be removed form his present positive environment. Per Bateman, J.A., dissenting, that the affidavits filed on behalf of the appellant were lacking in probative value. It is left, then, to determine the fitness of the sentence at the time it was made. Taking into account the factors before the sentencing judge, the sentence imposed could not be found to be clearly unreasonable.","The appellant plead guilty to theft of property of a value exceeding $5,000 contrary to s.334 of the Criminal Code. He was sentenced to 5 months imprisonment, 18 months probation and an 18 month period of probation. He appealed on the grounds the sentencing judge failed to give sufficient weight to the principle of rehabilitation. Dismissing the appeal, that the appellant's affidavit evidence was inadequate. The appellant had received no useful information about his past or present substance use. The evidence did not show that he had a problem with the use of drugs or alcohol while residing with him. There was no indication in the pre-sentence report that any further counselling was recommended or scheduled."

The Agreement provided that neither would claim spousal support.HELD: 1)Credibility was determinative. The wife was articulate, intelligent and forthright while the husband was found to be evasive, argumentative and untruthful in answering a number of questions including the circumstances surrounding the signing of the agreement, the untrue statements he set out in his divorce petition in Ontario regarding his residency and in applying for default judgment when he knew the petitioner had served an Answer. 2)The agreement was rendered 'void' by the fact the parties cohabited for more than 90 days. 3)Costs were left to the trial judge.","The parties signed a separation agreement dated September 6, 1996. The agreement provided that the parties would live separately and that neither would claim spousal support from the other. The following clause appeared in the agreement: 11. If the parties cohabited for more than 90 days with reconciliation as the primary purpose of the cohabitation, the provisions of the agreement will not be affected. The parties clearly intended to re-establish their life together as husband and wife in the fullest sense. The respondent was evasive, argumentative and untruthful in his answers to a number of questions. HELD: 1) The circumstances surrounding the signing of the so-called separation agreement and the reason he gave for theit; 2) The untrue statements set out in his divorce petition in Ontario as to his residency; and 3) His action in applying for a default judgment in the divorce proceedings when he knew the petitioner hadserved his solicitor with her Answer.  4) Although the parties had lived together for some time, the Court found that their relationship had been largely controlled by her former spouse and by the events that occurred during his search for new positions in the health care administration field. It was appropriate to grant costs to the respondent at the trial in light of the narrow issue presented to the Court."
9_1999canlii12597.txt,"The petitioner obtained an ex parte order under the Family Maintenance Act which restrains the Attorney General from paying any money owing under an action in Queen's Bench to the respondent and his solicitor and restraining the respondent from disposing of any monies received in the action. The respondent applies to have the order set aside. The respondent argues that a restraining order under the Act is a preservation of property order and should not be granted because the petitioner has not met the tests that govern the granting of such orders. He submits that the criteria for the granting of a preservation order is the same as for a interlocutory injunction. The respondent argues that before the Court can exercises its discretion and grant an order, is should have some evidence that the party being restrained would defeat a claim under the Act. HELD: The Court is satisfied that the respondent's personal claim for damages is the only asset the he has to satisfy the claim under the Act. Without prejudicing the applicant's claim, the Court will arbitrarily determine that the sum of $40,000 will likely be sufficient security. For the time being, the order will attach to the first $40,000 of funds received by the respondent, if and when any amount becomes payable to him. The parties may apply to vary this amount in future. Costs are reserved to be dealt with on the hearing of the application for maintenance. The Court is not satisfied that the jurisprudence with respect to injunctive remedies based on inherent jurisdiction of the court applies to an application under s.8 of the Act. If the criteria for granting a restraining order under the Act were meant to be the same, there would be no need for the unique provision of the Act. As s.8 was enacted to provide a solution where none had existed, the Court must primarily look to the statute itself for a determination of the appropriate considerations. Section 8 of the Act grants the Court the authority to restrain the disposition of assets and creates a new, but limited, form of injunctive relief with this remedy being available solely to prevent the impairment or defeat of the Act. The statute does not require the Court to be satisfied that the respondent is hindering or defeating a claim. When a respondent has only one asset that could reasonably satisfy a claim, his dependents and society as a whole have an interest in ensuring that the asset will be used for such purpose.","The petitioner obtained an ex parte order under s. 8(1) of The Family Maintenance Act (Family Maintenance Act) which:(a)restrains the Attorney General of Canada from releasing or paying any monies to the petitioner and from his solicitors in relation to the respondent's claim in Queen's Bench Action No. 2270/97, J.C. Regina (the 'Action'), pending the petitioner's application or further court order;(b)restricts the respondent from disposing of any of the monies that he has received or may receive; and(d)restrorbs the respondent with the costs of any application or hearing on any claim under the Act.HELD: The respondent's personal claim for damages in the Action is the only asset that might give him an ability to satisfy the claim under The Act that has been made by the petitioner on behalf of herself and the children. This $40,000 figure is purely arbitrary and either party may at any time apply to raise or lower it based on evidence available at the time of such application.  1)It was not satisfied that the jurisprudence with respect to injunctive remedies based on an inherent or equitable jurisdiction of the court applies to this application. If the criteria required to grant a restraining order pursuant to s. 45 of the Act were meant to be the same as those applicable in an application for an interlocutory injunction, there would have been no need for them. The criteria for the granting of a preservation order were identical to those set out in other legislation. The balance of convenience weighs in favour of granting an order. 2)The respondent has never had assets of significant value and there is no evidence he would voluntarily dispose of them without the consent of his dependants. The preservation of dependants outweighs an individual's rights in property. The Court compared the wording of s. 55 of The Enforcement of Maintenance Orders Act (EMSA) and s. 29 of The Matrimonial Property Act, 1997. The judge presiding over the hearing will have the final say in the matter."
2_2004nssf92.txt,"The husband applied to have the wife's application for retroactive child support to cover the costs of the child's post-secondary education struck as a matter more properly addressed as an issue of contract. In addition to the child support ordered in the Corollary Relief Judgment, the husband had signed a document in which he agreed to repay the costs of the daughter's American student loans (which had to be obtained in the wife's name as the wife was an American). The wife had also brought a separate action suing the husband in contract to enforce this obligation. Application granted; wife's application for retroactive child support struck as 'frivolous'. There was no evidence of the required change in circumstances necessary to support a variation application, there was nothing to enforce in the Corollary Relief Judgment as the  husband had met his obligations under that Order and the agreement he signed to repay the student loans was not binding under the Corollary Relief Judgment as it was not signed by both parties.","The wife brought an application pursuant to Rule 14.25 to strike out the husband's application for a variation in relation to spousal support and a retroactive child support order. She also sought declaratory relief, exemplary or punitive damages and costs. The husband had previously filed an application for consolidation so that one hearing would be possible. The wife's application sought to strike or have the court strike out her husband’s application for child support. HELD: The application was dismissed. The court found that the husband had complied with his child support obligation as set out in the corollary relief judgment and there was nothing to enforce. The only issue to be determined was whether the additional loan payments were known or anticipated at the time of the hearing. 1)The husband had made an agreement that he would be responsible for the repayments of the loans. It was clear from the pleadings and submissions that the wife was not concerned about the form of relief as contemplated in the agreement. She simply wanted the loan payments to cover loan payments for educational purposes. 2)The wife was estranged from her father and denied any obligation for the outstanding balance.  3)The only evidence advanced in support of the indemnity agreement may be something that could be relied upon as a promise made to the wife in the event that she was called on to pay the balance of the Federal Plus loans. There was no evidence the husband declared the agreement as income.  4)The application was also subject to the threshold test of material change in circumstances as defined in law. The Court found that it was impossible to determine whether the statement of claim disclosed a cause of action. The application could not be classed as frivolous or scandalous."
6_2015skqb138.txt,"Wills and Estates – Proof of Will in Solemn FormWills and Estates – Testamentary Capacity After the death of the testator, one of his five daughters brought an application for an order directing a trial to prove the testator’s 2013 will in solemn form on the ground that the testator did not have testamentary capacity to understand the nature of the document he was signing or the extent of his property. The testator and his wife had executed mirror wills in 2012. His wife died in September 2013, and within two days of her death the testator had signed a new will. It was based on his first will with some revisions. The value of the estate was approximately $343,000 and the will made bequests of $100 to the applicant and another daughter. The testator left the rest and residue of the estate divided into equal shares between his three other daughters. The applicant deposed that at the time the testator’s wife was dying, she visited him and found him to be very confused. When the testator’s lawyer came to meet with him as his wife was dying, the applicant stated that the testator said he did not remember the lawyer and would not sign anything. The only other evidence submitted by the applicant was a letter from the testator’s physician, who reported that he saw the testator in early September 2012 and that he was then alert and could recognize him. The evidence presented by the two daughters who were named as executors of the will consisted of their own affidavits and the affidavits of a friend of the testator; a bank official who had prepared a power of attorney for the testator made at the time of the death of his wife; and the lawyer who prepared the original 2012 wills and the 2013 will. The contents of the various affidavits deposed to the testator’s estranged relationship with the applicant and her sister, his intention to exclude the applicant from his will, and that he appeared to be mentally capable. The lawyer’s affidavit deposed that at the initial meeting that she attended with the testator when his wife was dying, he was devastated by grief and she did not take any instructions. When she met with him again to take instructions regarding his new will, she kept notes of them—the testator had expressly instructed her to make sure that the two daughters would get nothing except for the specific bequests. The lawyer confirmed that she had no concerns with the testator’s capacity. HELD: The application was dismissed. The court held that the applicant’s evidence in support of the challenge to the will was extremely thin and the descriptions of the testator’s behaviour did not raise doubt regarding his capacity regarding his property and his disposition of it. The other affidavits presented uncontradicted evidence of the testator’s undiminished mental capacity.","FIAT: In this application, one of the Szwagierczak's five daughters seeks an order directing a trial to prove the 2013 Will in solemn form. The grounds asserted by the applicant are that the defendant did not have testamentary capacity at the time of making his Will. HELD: The application is dismissed. 1) The Court was satisfied that the applicant had not made out a genuine issue for trial to establish the 2013 will in solemn Form. The Court reviewed the authorities and found that the threshold for the challenge was reasonably low. 2) There is nothing mysterious about the role of suspicious circumstances in this respect. The presumption simply casts an evidentiary burden on the defendant. It is presumed that the testator knew the contents of the will, freely approved of those contents and possessed the necessary testamentaries to the Will in those circumstances. However, the presumption, short-lived, may affect the ability of the propounder to rely on the presumption. 3) The test in Quaintance is, as is the general statement of the issue to be determined in Dieno, based in the context of jurisprudence respecting the wishes of testator and validity of will. The test here is whether the evidence presented is sufficient to meet the tests contemplated within the procedural framework. 4) The court reviewed the circumstances of each of the deceased's children and their families. It concluded that the respondent had not proven his case on a realistic prospect of trial. The fact that the children did not live in the home with the deceased and were in the nursing home with their mother and that they did not visit the mother often and had to drive the mother to and from the hospital was of concern. 5) The respondent did not appear to have any concerns about her mental capacity. She did not equate her emotions with lack of mental capacity and neither did the petitioner."
2009nssc86.txt,"The applicant applied under the Civil Procedure Rules (1972) for an order of mandamus compelling the respondent department to comply with a prior order of the Income Assistance Appeal Board. The applicant was denied income assistance for failure to supply requested information. He appealed the decision and the appeal board ordered his income assistance be reinstated. The respondent refused to reinstate assistance and made a request for additional information. Eventually, the applicant supplied the requested information and his assistance was reinstated. He sought retroactive amounts for the period falling between the appeal board's order and the time of reinstatement. Order granted, costs to the applicant in the amount of $750: assistance to be reinstated retroactively according to the time frame ordered by the appeal board. The respondent's argument that the applicant should be required to appeal their most recent decision on eligibility must be rejected. It would not be appropriate to require the applicant to appeal the respondent's refusal to abide by an existing appeal decision. To allow the respondent to ignore the appeal board's ruling and request additional information effectively undermines the appeal board's authority and makes a ruling by them meaningless. As for the other requirements for mandamus, the applicant had a legal interest in the outcome of the proceeding, the duty to him arose from the appeal board's decision, and the relevant Regulations (see Assistance Appeal Regulations, s. 14) confirm the respondent had no discretion to refuse to implement the appeal board's decision or to change the time period referenced in that decision.","The applicant sought an order in the nature of mandamus to compel the respondent to comply with an order of the Income Assistance Appeal Board. The applicant was disabled and had been recipient of income assistance from the Department of Community Services since 2006. His assistance was terminated in May 2006 due to failure to disclose requested information. He re-applied for income assistance in May 2007. His application was again denied on the ground that he failed to provide requested information as to his income. The Board ordered that his assistance be effective the date he was assessed in June 2007. Since the board so erred, the respondents argue that the provisions of the Act and the Regulations provide the authority to the director and the social services committee to vary an Order of the Board in certain procedural details in its implementation of that order, but not as authority to reject the entire finding of the Appeal Board because the Committee does not agree with it. In Dewolf v. Rent Review Commission (1982), 37, N.S.R. (2d) 259 The court granted the application for an order pursuant to mandamus (mandamus in force) compelling the applicant to implement the appeal board's decision of September 2007.

The third party argued the application essentially sought a contempt citation and should be directed to trial. The second issue concerned the respondent's opposition to the applicant's request for leave to move to Alberta, arguing that the move will be tantamount to a denial of access. The applicant had been prohibited in a 1998 order from removing the children from Saskatchewan without a court order, absent consent.HELD: 1)The issue of the payments was directed to trial and pre-trial conference to be held in January. 2)The mother was granted leave to move the children to Alberta.

The third party opposed the application for leave to move to Medicine Hat and sought findings of credibility. HELD: The application was directed to trial and a pre-trial conference was directed. The court encouraged the applicant to attain self-sufficiency and granted leave to remove the children from Medicine Hat; their primary residence with the respondent will thereby continue; the status quo as to access should also be maintained. The respondent was granted additional access to include Thursday or Monday, when the weekend falls on a statutory holiday and the applicant was prohibited from removing the children without court order, absent consent. The applicant's parents were to assist with the care of the children. A $10,000 loan was directed for the respondent and $800 was reserved for the applicant.

2008skqb33.txt,"The applicants apply for an order pursuant to Rule 173 of The Queen's Bench Rules striking paragraphs of the amended statement of claim on the basis that permitting these allegations in the statement of claim to remain would be an abuse of process. The paragraphs of the amended statement of claim at issue deal with the fact that the plaintiff alleges he was assaulted by the defendant and sustained bodily harm. The defendant was charged with assault, but his conviction was overturned on appeal. The issue is the effect of the acquittal in the criminal proceedings on the subsequent civil proceedings. HELD: The paragraphs of the statement of claim at issue do not amount to an abuse of process and the application is dismissed. 1) A verdict of acquittal in a criminal trial is inadmissible in a subsequent civil trial as proof that the party did not commit the offence.  2) In the criminal proceedings brought by the Crown against the defendant, the Crown bore the onus throughout to prove its case beyond a reasonable doubt and prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the defence of self-defence did not apply and the plaintiff did not have control of the proceedings. In the civil proceeding, the plaintiff is in a position to control the presentation of his case and must prove his case on a balance of probabilities. The onus of proving self-defence is on the defendant.

HELD: The application is dismissed. 1) A verdict of acquittal in a criminal proceeding is inadmissible in a subsequent civil proceeding as proof that the party did not commit the offence. There are good policy reasons in support of the conclusion that a victim who is a witness for the Crown in unsuccessful criminal proceedings should be entitled to proceed independently in subsequent civil proceedings against the same defendant. However, this is based on an entirely different footing from the one used in Sagon v. Royal Bank of Canada. Instead of considering merely the adequacy of the pleadings to support a reasonable cause of action, it may involve an assessment of the merits of the claim, and the motives of the plaintiff in bringing it. The victim may not wish to report criminal activity as it may preclude his subsequent opportunity to proceed civilly. 2) There are different parties in civil proceedings from criminal and of course, a different burden of proof. In the criminal proceedings brought by the crown against the plaintiff, Mr. Windrem did not have control of the proceedings. As in all criminal cases he was simply witness and was required to answer the questions of crown counsel in direct examination and to respond to the questions posed to him in the proceeding. He bears the burden of proving beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant did not act in self-defence."
d_1991canlii4322.txt,"A complaint was lodged against the applicant police officer that she had been discourteous to the victim of a sexual assault and that she had lied about being granted permission to attend a meeting held to investigate the assault. The applicant was given written notice of the substance of both allegations according to the disciplinary procedure set out in the regulations made pursuant to the Police Act, but in the space provided for the citation the notice cited only the regulation which dealt with the offense of being discourteous. A hearing before an inspector of the Police Department resulted in the applicant being found guilty of the offense of lying. She initiated a review by the Police Review Board which concluded that the section reference in the charge did not have to be accurate. The applicant brought this proceeding for judicial review and submitted that the Board's jurisdiction was limited by the citation of a particular regulation and to finding her guilty of the behaviour described in the regulation cited. Dismissing the application, that the failure to cite what the Board considered the proper offense in no way materially affected the procedural fairness of the hearings or limited the Board's jurisdiction. The applicant had complete notice of the nature of the allegations against her and was represented by counsel at the Board hearing.

On appeal","The Police Review Board conducted a hearing de novo and reached the same conclusion as the investigating officer regarding the complainant's 'guilt' of the alleged misconduct, specifically that she had permission of the Chief of the Police to attend a meeting. The Board found that the complainant had not given permission for her to be present at the meeting and that the penalty imposed was a reprimand. The applicant appealed. Dismissing the application, that the Board's decision to grant certiorari was patently unreasonable. It is clear from the record that the Review Board exists as a final, specialized forum in which matter of complaint against a police officer or internal discipline is fully heard by a member of the public having regard to all the circumstances. The failure to refer to what the Board considered the 'proper' offense in the original complaint was a technical defect only, and in no way affected the procedural fairness of the proceedings."

4_2009skqb403.txt,"The petitioner is a 39 year old nurse. She is legally married to Mr. McPhail and together they are the biological parents of three children. The petitioner separated from Mr. McPhail in October 2001 after the petitioner became romantically involved with the respondent, Dr. Hunt. The petitioner and the respondent began cohabitating sometime between November 2002 (according to her) and September 2003 (according to him). They separated in July 2008. The petitioner now commences a petition in which she claims relief from the respondent, Dr. Hunt, under The Family Property Act, The Children's Law Act, 1997 and The Family Maintenance Act, 1997. The three issues to be determined on this application are whether the petitioner has established a prima facie case that the respondent stood in loco parentis to the children such as to justify an interim child support order, whether the petitioner has established that she is entitled to interim spousal support and whether the Court should order an interim distribution of matrimonial property in favour of the petitioner in the amount of $20,000. HELD: 1) The petitioner has fallen short of establishing a prima facie case that the respondent stood in loco parentis to the children. The Court cannot make a determination based on conflicting affidavits. The determination will have to be made after trial. 2) There is no dispute the parties cohabitated as spouses for in excess of 2 years and that she is a spouse by virtue of the legislation. The principles in Marcotte v. Marcotte, 2008 SKQB 223 apply to the present case. In 2008 the respondent reported income of over $267,000, he has the ability to pay. The petitioner has annual income of over $71,000. Although the parties had a combined income of over $350,000 while they were together, it appears that their assets after their liabilities are deducted will result in a minimal net worth. The Court concludes that the petitioner is in need of some financial assistance, albeit not to the degree that she has suggested. A modest transfer of funds from the respondent to the petitioner should alleviate the majority of her negative cash flow problems. The petitioner's cohabitation with the respondent can only be described as short term. A spousal support payment of $1,500 per month is an appropriate interim amount. The payments will be paid for a total of 8 months.  3) Paying any money to any party at this stage does not meet the criteria set forth in the decisions of this Court. It is far from certain whether any money will be flowing from the respondent to the petitioner. The application for an interim distribution of family property is dismissed.","The applicant is 39 years old licensed practical nurse who is employed with the Mamawetan Health Region. She is married to a self-employed carpenter who also lives in La Ronge. They are the biological parents of three children. The applicant commenced a petition in October 2008 in which she claims relief under The Family Property Act, S.S. 1997, The Children's Law Act, 1997, and Family Maintenance Act 1997. HELD: The application for interim relief is dismissed. A modest transfer of funds from the respondent to the applicant should alleviate the majority of her negative cash flow problem. A spousal support payment of $1,500 per month is ordered for a total of eight months. There is no dispute that the applicant and the respondent cohabited for in excess of 2 years. However, the fact that one is not the biological parent of child does not necessarily mean that one may not be legally required to provide financial support for that child. Given the short-term relationship, a modest payment amount would go some way to relieve her from some of the economic hardship that she has encountered as a result of the matrimonial breakdown."

She argued that since the money paid was in relation to the youngest child, who in the circumstances took the place of a surviving spouse, the death benefit becomes fixed at $47,427, and the formula used in s.146(1) would be half of the income replacement benefit(the IRB) that the deceased would have been entitled to had she survived the accident. Accordingly the IRB to be used in s.246(5) should be $94,854. The sole issue was whether any additional child care benefits were payable under s.146(5) when the deceased was unemployed and had no income at the time of the fatal motor vehicle accident. HELD: The appeal was dismissed without order as to costs. Where the deceased victim would not have been entitled to any benefit had she survived the accident, the minimum death benefit is still payable, but that amount does not become a factor in calculating the IRB for the purpose of applying the formula contained in s.146(5). It is the total amount payable as a death benefit. The IRB in this case was zero and the amount payable pursuant to the formula in either s.146(1) or s.146(5) is zero. Where no benefit other than the minimum death benefit of $45,000 (adjusted for inflation) is payable under s.146(3), no further amount is payable under either s.146(5) or s.147(5).","The sole issue before the court was whether any additional dependant child care benefits were payable under s. 146(5) of the Automobile Accident Insurance Act when the deceased victim was unemployed and had no income at the time of the fatal motor vehicle accident. HELD: The children were not entitled to any additional benefits under s146(5). SGI paid to the Public Trustee for the children the sum of $47,427 as the minimum death benefit. Since the money paid by SGI was in relation to the youngest child, who in the circumstances of this case took the place of the surviving spouse, the death benefit was fixed at $45,000 and the formula used in s.146(1) was adjusted to change to reflect the difference in income between spouses."
2_2004skqb498.txt,"FIAT: By fiat of December 5, 2002, Gerein C.J. authorized the initiation of a derivative action by Dale Henry (Henry) on behalf of 609897 Saskatchewan Ltd. (609). By fiat of May 27 2004, the Court ruled that the defendants in the action were entitled to examine for discovery a representative of 609 and that Henry was obliged to appoint counsel for 609 in the action. In September 2004, clarification of the May 27 2004 fiat was sought. HELD: The questions raised by the parties together with the disparate positions taken by the participants demonstrate the confusion as to the nature of the action and of a party's rights and responsibilities within the action. The action is a derivative one in which the action by plaintiff, 609, proceeds for the benefit of 609 against those it alleges to have caused it loss or damage. Henry is empowered and obliged to appoint counsel for 609. Such counsel is entitled to have access to the relevant documents, records and employees for the purposes of the action. It follows that Henry and that counsel have professional and fiduciary obligations to 609. Henry's overall instructions to counsel should not be in conflict with the interests of 609 as Henry is obliged to advance the corporate interests in the derivative action. As no formal motion was brought in this proceeding and the matter proceeded with all parties consenting, there shall be no order as to costs. Henceforth, it is the plaintiff and the defendants, who have status in these proceedings, and not Henry, in his personal capacity, or the board of directors of 609.","FIAT. By fiat of May 27, 2004, the defendants in the action were entitled to examine a representative of 609 for discovery and that Henry was obliged to appoint counsel for the action. In September 2004, clarification of the earlier fiat was requested and, with the consent of the plaintiff, Ms. Ouellette for the defendants and Mr. Agnew for the board of directors, the matter proceeded by conference call and written submissions. HELD: It was the plaintiff and the defendants who have status in the proceedings and not Henry in his personal capacity nor the directors of the company.  1)As a corporation, the defendant is empowered and obliged to appointed counsel for 609. Whether that counsel is Mr. Brehon, another member of his firm or someone from outside that firm is entirely matter for Henry. Such counsel is entitled to access to the relevant documents, records and employees for the purposes of the action, including preparation of a statement as to documents and following the modified discovery process set out in my earlier fiat. It follows that Henry and that counsel have professional and fiduciary obligations to the plaintiff. 2)Costs in prosecuting the action will remain with the plaintiff as the action remains derivative one in which the action by plaintiff 609 proceeds for the benefit of the 609 against those it alleges to have caused it loss or damage. These concerns still pertain and, without prejudice to renewal of the application for cost reimbursement when the concerns expressed by the Chief Justice can be allayed, the costs in first instance remain with Henry. 3)Questions 4 and 5 to be resolved on the basis of the existing rules of court and the applicable jurisprudence, it not having been demonstrated that this aspect of the proceedings warrant modification of the rules, are self-evident once one accepts the unity of interest between the defendant and 609 that is reflected in the decision authorizing the derivative action. The nature of the act is such that Henry's overall instructions to counsel should not be in conflict with the interests of the other company as he is obliged to so instruct 609's counsel. 4)Some of the misunderstandings have their genesis in the pleadings which recite the plaintiff to be Henry, capacity which the defendants admit. As the plaintiff is and was 609, contrary to Brehon's position the action remained a derivative one. Contrary to the position that the action continues to be derivative one, which continues to benefit the plaintiff by way of undertakings at the Examination, and if so, who has the right to claim privilege on"
d_2006nssc280.txt,"The accused applied to quash a search warrant, which authorized the search and seizure of his accounting records for a two-year period. The warrant alleged that the accused, an accountant who ran his business out of his home, filed a fraudulent T4 and created false T4 income in order to obtain a tax refund and misreported HST sales. Although the correct information was contained in the informant's file, there were two errors made in the Information to Obtain the warrant; the Crown argued that the errors were inadvertent and not intended to deceive the Justice and that the things to be searched for had relevance beyond the discrepancies. The applicant also argued that the issuing Justice should have recused himself due to being in a conflict of interest situation from having provided independent legal advice to the applicant's wife in respect of a mortgage transaction approximately seven years ago and later being consulted by the wife when the parties were experiencing marital difficulties. Application to quash the warrant allowed on the basis that there were not reasonable and probable grounds for its issuance; there was no reasonable apprehension of bias on behalf of the Justice. The court drew the inference that the informant would not have pursued the warrant without the undisputed and seriously erroneous information and noted that these errors occurred despite the presence of contrary information in the informant's file. There was no evidence as to what information the wife had imparted to the Justice in their previous encounters; the oath sworn by the Justice and the fact that the last time the Justice represented the wife was approximately five years prior to the issuance of the warrant militated against a reasonable person having an apprehension of bias.","The applicant sought an order in the nature of certiorari (pursuant to Rule 58 and s. 482(3)(c) of the Criminal Code) relating to the issuance of a search warrant on May 3, 2005. The warrant alleged that the accountant filed fraudulent T4 and created false T4 income in order to obtain a tax refund, and misreported HST sales. An earlier Information, sworn on April 21, 2005 had been a basis for a prior warrant issued that day. The application sought the disqualification of a provincial court judge from hearing his trial on the basis of an apprehension of bias. The applicant claimed the judge had dismissed him as her counsel in the last matter on which he had been retained. He claimed he was unaware that the informant had been consulted by his wife in relation to any of the income tax investigations carried on by the CRA. HELD: The application was dismissed with costs.  1) The applicant's own evidence supports the inference that he would not have pursued a warrant without the paragraphs 20-23 in the Information. Unless real bias can be shown, such prior contact is not necessary to raise the issue of bias and the Court cannot conclude that they rise above the level of'suspicion' to make out reasonable and probable grounds for a warrant to search the applicant's (and his wife's) home. 2) There was no evidence of invasion of privacy or invasion of personal privacy by the informant. The search warrant was executed by the RCMP. 3) The documents were found at the respondent's place of business, located in his and Ms. Taylor's residence, and in any storage facilities occupied by the respondent. 4) The search was conducted in the absence of the defective paragraphs. The respondent did not appear in court on behalf of the applicant and did not correspond with him on his behalf.  5) The application for leave to appeal was dismissed. The Court was satisfied that the affidavit contained incomplete and misleading information. The informant was entitled to make full and frank disclosure to the court. In light of his clear statement on cross-examination, the applicant said he would be more comfortable omitting information that he now knows to be erroneous. The reasonableness standard of candour is not difficult to understand; there is nothing technical about it. Once the allegation of misleading and inaccurate HST reporting is removed, the substance of the Information rests upon the handwritten T4 submitted by the applicant that does not appear to be reconciled with the company payroll."

While the claim discloses a possible cause of action based on the Attorney General's statutory undertakings, this alone doesn't decide the matter.

4_2007skqb397.txt,"The plaintiff claims damages against the defendants Tim Sullivan and Sullivan Instrumentation (collectively 'Sullivan') for breach of an employment contract when Sullivan was employed by the plaintiff to perform services for PCS at the mine. The issue is whether Sullivan breached his employment contract by submitting a proposal to PCS when he was still employed by the plaintiff. HELD: 1) There is nothing wrong with Sullivan setting up his corporation with a view to starting a competitive business after his employment with the plaintiff ended. An employee must be free to plan his future after his employment with his employer ends. He did not prepare the proposals during working hours. He prepared them with the assistance of his wife, when he was off work in Regina. However, it has been held that an employee who submitted a bid in competition to his or her employer during a period of working notice was in breach of the employment contract. Therefore, Sullivan breached his duty of fidelity to the plaintiff. 2) However, the Court was not satisfied that the plaintiff proved it would have been in a position to perform further work for PCS if Sullivan had not submitted a proposal. There were no union members available for it to hire. It had no employees ready to perform the contract. It would appear the plaintiff had abandoned any thought of continuing the contract until the end of December. If he had pulled employees from another contract, he would have suffered no damage. 3) Sullivan was not in a managerial position with the plaintiff. He did not possess any confidential information or trade secrets. He knew nothing as to the profit margins of the plaintiff. He did have business experience but not confidential information or a trade secret. 4) The plaintiff in this case is entitled to no more than nominal damages in the amount of $500 plus costs.","The plaintiff claims damages against the defendant for breach of contract whereby the plaintiff was to supply electricians to perform work at its potash mine at Rocanville, Saskatchewan. HELD: The plaintiff is awarded $500. The defendant was not entitled to any more than nominal damages. The court erred in fact in characterizing the plaintiff's actions as mere preparation. The plaintiff competed with her employer for business which had been the employer's. She was entitled to four months notice. The decision to hire outside electricians was made two weeks before the contract ended, which persuaded the court that it was not a breach of his duty of fidelity. The only remaining issue is whether Sullivan breached his employment contract by submitting a proposal to PCS when he was still employed by the plaintiff. The law is well settled that an employee is under an implied obligation not to compete with an employer during the term of his or her employment. The fact that the plaintiff telephoned the union hall and was told there were no members available for him to hire and he did not return to Saskatchewan until the day before PCS required two technicians and had no employees ready to go on their own. The trial judge found that the respondent had planned on competing with the plaintiff for the BCCW contract while she was in its employ and did not consider it to be confidential information or a trade secret.

The applicants were partners in an architecture firm that provided design drawing and specifications for the construction of the Education Building at the University of Saskatchewan. The building was substantially completed in 1970. In 1985, stone panels fell off the exterior of the building. In 1986 the respondent commenced an action against its insurer for coverage of the loss. In 1991, the insurer commenced an action against the applicants in order to preserve the respondent's right to relief. In 1997, the Court determined the respondent was not entitled to coverage from its insurer. The respondent commenced control over the litigation against the applicant in 1997. Between 1997 and 2010, documents were exchanged, discoveries were held and an unsuccessful settlement negotiation was held. In 2010 all of the defendants applied to have the respondent's claim dismissed for want of prosecution. The Chambers judge struck the claims against all the defendants except the applicant. HELD: Leave to appeal was granted because there was some merit to the applicant's arguments that they had been treated inconsistently and that key witnesses were no longer available to testify because of death or mental or physical disability, which would prejudice the applicant.

They applied to have the University's claim against them dismissed for want of prosecution but were unsuccessful. They seek leave to appeal that decision. HELD: Leave to appeal is granted to appeal.

The standard of review applied in respect of decisions such as the one in issue here will present some difficulty for the applicants on appeal.

The accused was permitted to use his cell phone on the way to the RCMP detachment to call his wife in Calgary and request help in finding a lawyer. He did not receive a call back from his wife. The RCMP officer advised the accused that he could provide a phone book and access to a phone and that Legal Aid was available. The accused stated that he would talk to Legal Aid. After the call was completed, the accused asked the officer if they had got the dumbest lawyer they could find. The officer asked the accused if he was satisfied with his call and he said 'sure.' The accused testified that his response was sarcastic, but the officer took it at face value. The accused said nothing further about the lawyer call. The accused's movements in the detachment were recorded on VHS videotape. The video is a series of still shots taken every four seconds and there is no audio. The video was taped over every 60 days and had been destroyed before it was requested by defence counsel. HELD: There was no breach of the accused's rights under s. 10(b) of the Charter. Even though the accused's cell phone was taken from him before he received a call back from his wife, it is clear that the accused made a conscious decision to call Legal Aid, and by implication, did not wish to pursue the first course of action.

HELD: There was no breach of the accused's right to counsel.  1) The accused did not clearly indicate that the legal advice he received was inadequate or suggest that he wanted to consult with another lawyer. Accordingly, the officer was justified in assuming that he was satisfied. 2) The destruction of video evidence did not breach his rights under s. 10(b). 3) It was not necessary for the Court to decide whether the RCMP was negligent in erasing the recording after 60 days. This would only become an issue once the Court determines that the destroyed evidence was relevant.

He died of drowning due to inexperienced scuba diving. Defendant not guilty of the offence charged; the defendant was not the deceased's employer. All four individuals thought of themselves as self-employed fishermen and had a profit-sharing agreement; the evidence did not establish that the defendant was acting as skipper or captain in the owner's absence; the defendant was not operating the vessel and the evidence did not show that the defendant had any kind of authority over the other fishers. The deceased was dependant on the boat's owner for the boat and part of the gear, for another individual for the licence and on the defendant for the balance of the gear; the relationship was closer to that of independent contractor than that of employer-employee.","The defendant was charged under s.13(1)(a) of the Occupational Health and Safety Act with failing to take reasonable precautions to ensure the health and safety of persons at a workplace.

HELD: The petitioner was given judgment for $51,725.82 with taxable costs of the action payable within 3 months, failing which, the petitioner may apply for directions as to sale of the family property. The family property was divided equally from the date the action was commenced. The legislation does not permit an exemption in the circumstances for the $12,000 from the sale of the respondent's trailer used to purchase the acreage. It was concluded the respondent's father owned the tractor. Two other tractors were exempt and a partial exemption was allowed for a snowmobile and some tools. While he owned a truck prior to the marriage, it could not be traced to the current truck. The petitioner's automobile and boat were added to the distribution value of the machinery. There were no records of the value of the pigs. Whatever the number brought into the marriage, it had been reduced by the sale of the animals. The value of livestock to be distributed was $25,261. The RRSP purchase prior to the marriage was exempt. The claim for the debt for the tractor owned by the father and alleged debt for a rod weeder were rejected. Debts owed to the father for a tractor and a truck were statute-barred. The petitioner should bear no responsibility for monies paid for fertilizer, chemicals, fuel, repairs, parts and insurance as they were on-going expenses for the operation of the farm.

In 1996, the respondent purchased a large tractor and farm machinery. Over a period of time, the farm machinery was purchased and the sale proceeds were used to purchase the acreage. HELD: The petitioner was awarded judgment against the respondent in the amount of $51,725.82 together with taxable costs of the action. 1) The farm machinery comprises a major portion of the family property. It is here that there is a serious dispute in respect to what pieces of machinery constitute family property; what exemptions are available to the respondent; and what value should be attributed to the equipment which is subject to distribution. 2) The respondent claims that a 1990 Ford F-150 truck is exempt. In the past, he has owned several farm machinery, some of which were purchased from uncle's estate and related to the on-going operation of the farm. The petitioner received no benefit from these expenses. Accordingly, she should bear no responsibility for the payments made and the Court fixed the value of the snowmobile at $800. 3) There is a claim for $16,500 which is said to be owing to the father for the Versatile 160 tractor. The father owned the tractor prior to the marriage. He did not contest either and confirmed it was owned by him. 4) The Court balanced the oral testimony of several witnesses, including the petitioner, while also considering the content of large number of documents.

The appellant appeals only portions of the interim order relating to spousals and exclusive possession. HELD: The application to lift a stay of proceeding is allowed.

After a decree nisi of foreclosure had issued but before expiration of the redemption period, one of the defendant registered owners (the former husband) applied for judicial sale of the matrimonial home. The joint owners separated in 1999 and are involved in an acrimonious family law court action. The wife has exclusive possession of the property. The Credit Union as first mortgagee opposed the application. The co-owner did not participate. HELD: The application was dismissed. 1)This is not the proper forum to attempt to affect a family property settlement. The husband was not entitled in these proceedings to a possession order. The wife prevented every attempt to show the property to prospective owners. There was no reason to assume she will be any more cooperative with a court appointed realtor. The Credit Union did not request immediate possession. 2)The court's entitlement to order a judicial sale at any stage of foreclosure proceedings before a final decree issues is no longer questionable. The court reviewed the history of the statutory authority for a judicial sale in a mortgage foreclosure proceedings. The 1852 Chancery Procedure Amendment Act was repealed in 1881 and replaced by Ordinance 51, Rule 1, which became law in the NWT by virtue of the Judicature Ordinance No.6 of 1893. It is now found in s.70 of the Queen's Bench Act in its modified form. Deciding whether it is 'necessary or expedient' within the meaning of s.70 of the Queen's Bench Act is, however, a judicial exercise.","After a decree nisi of foreclosure issued, but before expiration of the redemption period, one of the defendant registered owners applied for judicial sale of the mortgaged property, being the matrimonial home. The relief sought was for an order that the property be listed with a private realtor for fixed time at an upset (listing) price of $120,000. The mortgagee, Border Credit Union, opposed the application and the co-owner, Sandra Klarenbach, did not participate in the hearing. HELD: The application was dismissed. The court's entitlement to order judicial sale at any stage of foreclosure proceedings before a final decree issues is no longer questionable. See Saskatoon Credit Union Ltd. v. Gozanski, et al, (1994) for example.  1) The registered owners have had ample since their separation to resolve their family property dispute. The foreclosure proceedings have been in progress for six months. This is not the proper forum to attempt to effect a family property settlement. 2) The application is dismissed.  3) Border is entitled to apply for a final order of foreclosure. Any further delay that does not result in sale and payment of the mortgage in full, will result in lost security value for the Credit Union. 4) There is no reason to assume that the applicant will be any more co-operative with a court-appointed realtor."

The Defendant Unions did not file any materials. HELD: Application allowed. On the whole of the evidence the court was satisfied that the applicant had raised a substantial question to be tried, had established a prima facie case, was in danger of suffering injury which could not adequately be compensated for by the award of damages in money, and that the balance of convenience in the matter favoured the applicant.","The applicant sought an interim injunction until trial or until a further order on certain terms and conditions. HELD: The application was granted. An interim injunction was granted until further order. 1)The applicant raised a substantial question to be tried. The Court established a prima facie case of the violation by the defendants of a right that the applicant might have. The applicant has shown more than the mere prospect or anapprehension of injury. It has shown that the defendants in doing that which the applicant alleges is in violation of its rights are doing so in a manner which is in breach of that right. 2)The balance of convenience in the matter favours the applicant.

The issues on appeal were: 1) the length of the sentence; and 2) the refusal of the sentencing judge to order forfeiture of the truck used by the respondent to bring the drugs into Saskatchewan and to deliver them. The sentencing judge found the truck was not 'integral to the offence.' HELD: The Crown is granted leave to appeal. 1) The appeal against the length of sentence is dismissed. 2) The appeal of the failure to order forfeiture of the truck is allowed. The truck is ordered forfeited. 1) Although the sentence imposed was at the very low end of the range, in these circumstances, there is no basis for interfering with it.  2) Upon conviction, the first step the trial judge ought to have taken was to determine whether the property was 'offence-related property' within the meaning of the CDSA. It is clear the truck is 'offence-related property' in that it was used in connection with the commission of a designated substance offence. The sentencing judge failed to consider the definition in the CDSA. Section 19 of the CDSA allows innocent parties who have a valid interest in property to apply for an order of restoration. However, the innocent party must be either the lawful owner or lawfully entitled to possession of the property which would otherwise be forfeited. The Court may order in its discretion that the property be returned to the innocent person. In this case, the vehicle was owned by the respondent and the parents are not lawfully entitled to its possession. The sentencing judge had no discretion but was required to order forfeiture and erred in failing to do so. He further erred in considering proportionality as a factor to be considered when dealing with the forfeiture of personal property.","The respondent, resident of Manitoba, was convicted of having in his possession controlled substance for the purpose of trafficking contrary to s. 5(2) of the Controlled Drugs and Substances Act and was sentenced to a term of incarceration of 9 months with a 10 year firearms prohibition. The offence took place in Yorkton. The sentencing judge refused to order forfeiture of the truck, finding the respondent was a low risk to reoffend and of no real danger to society. He found the venture to be commercial one, albeit of small-time nature. The Crown put a street value of between $2000 and $2000 on the drugs and the respondent valued the drugs at slightly under $2000. There was no basis for interfering with the sentence imposed. The truck was owned by the respondent and paid for through a loan from his parents. The trial judge found that 'basically all of the money' to pay for the truck came from the parents' bank account but they had registered no lien to protect their interests. In relation to a vehicle, the Court may take into account the impact that an order of forfeiture may have on the immediate family of the person charged or convicted of the offence provided the dwelling house was the respondent's principal residence at the time the charge was laid and continues to be his principal residence and if the member is innocent of any complicity in the offence or of any collusion in relation to the offence."
2_2008nsca28.txt,"The worker was unsuccessful in his claim for compensation for gradual onset stress when the Workers' Compensation Appeal Tribunal (WCAT) found that the conditions in his workplace did not constitute unusual or excessive stressors as required under the terms of the relevant Board policy. The worker appealed, arguing, inter alia, that the WCAT erred in finding that his subjective reaction to the stressors in the workplace was not relevant. Appeal dismissed; the WCAT correctly applied the objective approach in determining whether there were workplace events or stressors sufficient to support a claim for gradual onset stress. The Board policy reflected the previous applicable law; namely, that workplace events and stressors must be unusual and excessive in comparison to the work- related events or stressors experienced by an average worker in the same or similar occupation.","The Workers' Compensation Appeals Tribunal (WCAT) held that it had correctly decided that compensable gradual onset stress required that there have been work-related events or stressors that are unusual and excessive viewed objectively, that is, in comparison to those experienced by an average worker in the same or similar occupation. The issue was whether the Policy was wrong to take this approach and if not, whether WCAT applied it unreasonably to the worker's situation. HELD: The appeal was dismissed. WCAT did not err by considering whether stressors experienced by the worker had been unusual or excessive on an objective basis in the sense required under the Policy. This reflects the law which was in place before 2005. The Board exercised its policy-making authority to bring clarity to these issues. The Policy provides that both gradual onset and traumatic event stressors are compensable under GECA and set out the conditions under which each type of stress is compensable. The policy is consistent with the principles enunciated by the Supreme Court of Canada in Dunsmuir v. New Brunswick. 1) The Court reviewed the state of the law at the Tribunal level and found that, in light of the policy adopted by the Board, there was some inconsistency regarding whether an objective or subjective approach should be taken to assessing the workplace stressors. The Court found that the respondent had not err in applying an objective approach to the workplace events and that such an approach was the correct one, both under Policy 1.3.6 and under the general law applying to GECA claims in Nova Scotia. 2) There is no dispute about the standard by which we should review these questions on appeal. The question is whether the Board applied the correct legal test in this case (the first issue) is reviewed for correctness. How it applied it applied to the second and third grounds of appeal is reviewed according to the reasonableness standard."

c_1996canlii472.txt,"The plaintiff held a mortgage on a house destroyed by a suspicious fire. At the time of the fire there were two insurance policies in place for the purpose of indemnifying the plaintiff. One was placed by the mortgagors with the defendant to protect both their interests and those of the plaintiff. When the defendant notified the plaintiff that it was going to cancel the policy, the plaintiff placed a second policy on the property. The fire occurred less than a day before the first policy was to be cancelled. The defendant refused to honour the policy. It claimed that the formal Proof of Loss filed by the plaintiff was fraudulent, as it failed to disclose the existence of the second policy. Finding for the plaintiff, that the defendant has not satisfied the heavy burden of producing clear and satisfactory evidence that the plaintiff, through its employees, acted wilfully and knowingly to claim the benefit of coverage to which it was not entitled.","In advancing their claim against one insured, Canada Trustco failed to disclose the second policy. The Owners/Mortgors, who owned the property under the terms of the mortgage agreement with the defendant, failed to obtain a replacement policy. As a result of two claims filed with the insurers, one of which was for non-payment of the insurance premium, the other insurer refused to pay. The plaintiff foreclosed on the property, claiming foreclosure action. The defendant brought an action against the plaintiff for breach of contract and negligent misrepresentation. Awarding the plaintiff $5,000 for past and future loss of income, that in light of the amount owing on the mortgage and the fact that the plaintiff had chosen not to pay the premium herself, the court adopted the standard of proof of $7,000 as opposed to $10,000. In a civil action, where a claim is made on the basis of misrepresentations made by the insured against the defendant and the insurer failing to notify the insurer of the policy and the plaintiff's failure to pay for the policy in a timely manner, that the claim is still on balance of probabilities but on a higher degree of probability commensurate with the conduct alleged."

The police first noticed the accused when he got out of his vehicle (which was parked near a pub), staggered slightly and then got back in. The defendant's evidence was that he had only entered his vehicle to listen to music while he decided whether to walk to a nearby party or his girlfriend's house. Defendant found not guilty of either offence charged. From the defendant's whole course of conduct, which included driving the vehicle to the pub before consuming any alcohol, walking to his friend's house and back again to the pub, as well as his stated intention to leave the vehicle where it was, the court concluded that he had rebutted the presumption under s. 258(1(a). Given that the defendant's vehicle was parked on a level parking lot with its nose two feet or less from a building, the parking brake was engaged, the vehicle was in first gear and the engine was not running, the court concluded that there was little, if any, danger of the vehicle being set in motion unintentionally or of it becoming a danger to the public.","The accused was charged with driving while his ability to operate a motor vehicle was impaired contrary to s. 253(a) of the Criminal Code; having consumed alcohol in such a quantity that his concentration exceeded 80 milligrams in 100 milliliters of blood; having been found by the investigating officer behind the wheel of the vehicle in the driver's seat to engage the emergency brake and turn off the engine; having done so while his blood alcohol level exceeded.08; having care or control of the motor vehicle as a result of the fact that he was intoxicated and had not made other arrangements for transportation home; having demonstrated that he did not intend to drive and having rebutted the presumption under s. 258(1)(a), the accused was not guilty of either offence."

During the separation the father paid some maintenance for the child pursuant to an agreement made by the parties themselves, and had extensive access to the child, she spending at least one weekend a month with him, as well as the summer holiday. HELD: Appeal allowed orally.  1) The oral reasons of the Family Court judge granting interim custody to the father were not available to the court, so it had no reasons for the decision available to assist it in the review of the decision. 2) The appeal must succeed. Even assuming the Investigation Record was admissible into evidence by reason of the agreement of the parties, and that the psychologist's report was admissible into evidence under s. 97 of The Queen's Bench Act, both of which propositions are at least arguable, there is no evidence other than unsworn hearsay evidence upon which it could be found that the mother was alcoholic and that the child suffered from it, while there is sworn evidence from the mother denying that to be so, as well as sworn evidence from three other persons supporting the mother's evidence to at least some degree. The father's affidavits are the only sworn evidence filed in support of his case. It is apparent that the father had no personal knowledge of the mother's drinking habits during the past four years, nor any personal knowledge of how the mother cared for the children. 3) It is apparent that none of the authors of the documents supporting the father's position that the mother is an alcoholic and is not properly caring for the child (the Investigation Record and The Drug and Alcohol Assessment Report) had any personal knowledge that that is the case. The information conveyed is nothing more than the opinion of the authors based on hearsay, namely information obtained by third parties, the only one identified is Ms. Tindall. One is left wondering why no one sought to obtain an affidavit from her. 4) Hearsay matters in the father's affidavits should not have been considered. The report were not sworn or verified under oath.  Thus Rule 603(3) does not apply to them, and to the extent that they were based on hearsay, they should not have been considered. Without the hearsay evidence, there was no case for even the direction of a trial of the issue, let alone an order in favour of the father.","The appeal is from an order granting interim custody of a 10 year old girl to her father, notwithstanding that the child had been in the custody of the mother since the mother and father separated about 4 years ago.

He alleged that the mother was an alcoholic and as result did not properly care for the children. The mother filed an affidavit denying all of the allegations, and in particular, that she was the alcoholic and that her alcoholism adversely affected the child.

The police arrived at the scene at 2:12 a.m. The accused was seated in the police car and was first spoken to shortly before 3:00 a.m. The officer determined through CPIC that the accused was prohibited from driving in Saskatchewan. The demand for breath sample was made at 2:48 a.m. At 2:50 a.m. he was given his rights and he spoke to lawyer prior to providing sample. HELD: The evidence of the crown witnesses was accepted over that of the defendant. The Court found beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant was the operator of the vehicle when the collision occurred and therefore the accused was found guilty of driving while disqualified. The crown was not able to prove beyond a reasonable doubt the time of the accident and, therefore, is not entitled to rely upon the presumption provided in s.258(1) of the Code. The Court was not able to conclude that the first sample was taken within 2 hours of the incident. On the charge of impaired driving, the Court had no doubt that the accused's ability to operate a motor vehicle was impaired by alcohol. The Court also held that there was no breach of fundamental justice by virtue of the discussion of the police witnesses with the civilian witnesses during the trial. When witness remains in the courtroom after an exclusion order and then testifies, the trial judge may consider this in deciding the weight to be given to the evidence of that witness. This principle is equally applicable to the case at hand where witnesses who had yet to testify discussed the evidence with other witnesses after their testimony. The Court rejected the defence argument that there was an appearance of unfairness about the trial process that requires that a stay of proceedings to be entered. The Court held that there must be manifest unfairness in the trial process as a result of the impugned behaviour in order to find a breach of fundamental justice. Here the impugned conduct only affects the weight to be given to the evidence of the police officers. The conversation complained of took place outside of the courtroom at trial and was not material to the outcome of the trial or the charges.

The appellant then sought an order from the Court of Queen's Bench quashing the trial proceedings. That application was dismissed and the appellant appealed to this Court. At trial, the appellant made an application for an order quashing the information as being a nullity. He contended it was drafted so as to violate the Code s. 789(2) of which states: 'No information in respect of an offence for which, by reason of previous convictions, a greater punishment may be imposed shall contain any reference to previous convictions.' The trial judge dismissed the application to quash.

Rather, he contended that, after recognizing a problem in relation to s. 789(2) of the Code and severing count 4 of the information, the trial judge should have dealt only with that count. More specifically, the appellants contended that an apprehension of bias arose when the judge elected to proceed on the first three counts, i.e. the charges concerning impaired driving, refusing a breath demand and obstruction. This was said to be the case because the judge had learned of a previous conviction in the course of severing the drive while disqualified count. HELD: The appeal is dismissed. The test for apprehension of bias is well settled. The leading case in the criminal context is R. v. S.(R.D.). The test is: what would an informed person, viewing the matter realistically and practically Ã» and having thought the matter through Ã» conclude. It is inevitable that accused persons will appear before judges who know of their criminal histories. The community rightly trusts that such information will play no part in judicial decision making. Accordingly, at least in the normal course, mere knowledge of an accused's criminal record does not automatically disqualify a judge from presiding at a trial.

She admitted that the defendant had asked her prior to her leave if her job could be done in less hours, and that she said it might be possible. The defendant alleged that this should have made it clear to the plaintiff that her position was being changed from full-time to permanent part-time, and constituted reasonable notice. Awarding the plaintiff eight month's notice, that the proposed changes to the job fundamentally altered the employment contract without giving the plaintiff reasonable actual notice. This was therefore a constructive dismissal without cause.","This was an action for damages for wrongful dismissal where the plaintiff contends that she was constructively dismissed without notice by her employer, the defendant. The issue was whether there was constructive dismissal, at what point did the plaintiff have notice of the changes which constituted constructive dismissal? HELD: The appropriate period of notice was 8 months. The plaintiff was awarded damages on the basis of eight months salary at the rate she was receiving at the time of her last employment with the defendant, plus vacation pay at 6% per annum. 1)It is not always easy to find employment in an area where there is an abundance of employment opportunities and an over abundance of qualified people who are willing to work at a modest rate as illustrated by the case of the respondent. This is not to suggest that the plaintiff was overpaid for the work she was doing. Rather it seems to be due to an enormous amount of change in the defendant's policy. 2)The plaintiff has not been successful at any rat of pay in the past. She has turned down no positions because she has not had the option of doing so. She simply had not been offered any positions. Considering all of the circumstances, the court concluded that an appropriate time of notice is eight months. 3)Costs were awarded in the amount of $10,000 plus $1,000 in prejudgment interest. 4)There was no evidence of wilful blindness on the part of the plaintiff. She had not seen the changes in the terms of the employment contract, despite having been employed for six years. The defendant put forth a 'take it or leave it' proposition to her which was an insult to an employee of six years whom the defendant acknowledged merited the highest recommendation. In such a situation, the employer clearly wanted to get rid of the employee."
6_2012skqb275.txt,"The parties agree that joint custody is appropriate, but the petitioner mother asked that the principal residence of the two boys be varied and awarded to her. The parties live blocks from each other, but the transition between homes has not gone well. The children have been primarily residing with the father. The father has been in three motor vehicle accidents within three years and is facing criminal charges as a result of the most recent one. The father works long hours as a maintenance man. The mother has four other children from previous relationships. The children of the marriage indicate that they have some problems with one step brother, who lives in their mother's home. The children's academic performance is not strong and the parents have made little effort to assist their children in pursuing an education. One child has been non- compliant with his ADHD medication while in the father's care. While the mother has a more stable residence, both parties have bounced from home to home. The father has tended to abdicate parenting responsibilities to his relatives and has not used the mother as a caregiver of first resort. The mother's relationship with her children has not been fostered in a meaningful way. HELD: While there is no ideal solution, the Court ordered a shared parenting arrangement where the children would spend one week in each home when school started in the fall. The parents were required to participate in mediation sessions which were to be paid for by the father. Joint custody was ordered. The father was ordered to pay child support in accordance with the Guidelines.","The parties met in 2000 and were married in 2001. The father had had primary residence by interim order but that arrangement was fraught with difficulty for reasons which will be explored. The mother, Sherri, asks that the boys' principal residence be varied and awarded to her. HELD: 1) The best interests test governs the determination on the issue of primary residence. Although the parties' relationship was not tumultuous, the father has bounced from home to home. The boys receive minimal direction or discipline. The parties' home continues to be under renovation and occupied by the petitioner and the children. Despite his physical injuries, the petitioner is assisting with renovations. Although he was not employed full-time, he was assisting with the renovations. He has abdicated a significant chunk of his caregiving role to his mother and sisters. His unfortunate injuries in the past two years have made him non-ambulatory and heavily dependent on others. There are red flags.  2) The courts have regard only for the best interests of the child and for that purpose shall take into account: the quality of the relationship that the child has with the person who is seeking custody and any other person who may have close connection with the child; the emotional well-being of the children; the sufficiency of the evidence in supporting the evidence; and the appropriate balance of justice, fairness and equity in the circumstances of the cases."
b_2016skqb29.txt,"HELD: The application was dismissed. The court found with respect to the issues that: 1) the respondent elected not to challenge the imputation of income made in 2005. The court assumed that the imputation was correct. The respondent had not shown a material change required to vary the obligation nor had he met the onus to justify the need for a change to the amount of child support payable for the years 2005 to 2012. From January 2016, the respondent was ordered to pay child support for one child based upon his current income ; and 2) the respondent had not provided any meaningful financial support for his children for the entire period despite the fact that enforcement steps had been taken by the Maintenance Enforcement Office. The court determined that the respondent had the ability to pay the arrears and it would not expunge them. The arrears from 2013 to date would be adjusted to accord with the respondent’s current income.","The respondent applies for an order to discontinue his obligation to pay child support and spousal support and for all support arrears to be expunged. He relies upon s. 17 of the Divorce Act, RSC 1985, and s. 14 of the Federal Child Support Guidelines.HELD: 1) The original order was correct at the time it was made. The matter did not proceed beyond the interim stage. Rather, from April 2005 through to the present the respondent has been content to have the existing order in place and did not seek to challenge it by way of trial proceedings to obtain a final order different from that pronounced by McIntyre J. 2) The respondent is able to establish he has been working full-time employment for the past four years. In those years he earned an average of $55,120 per annum. This actual situation does constitute material change. There is little doubt it will be onerous for him but then he has avoided paying anything for a considerable period of time. In light of his recalcitrant approach to his support obligation, neither the passage of time nor the quantum of the arrearars should deter from the fact he hasn't provided any meaningful financial support to his children and his former spouse for the entire time the order has been in place. 3) The Court must accept the original Order was correct and it was not made in 2005. It must then determine whether the Arrears of support be varied retroactively to impute a different, albeit lower, income that was said to have been earned by the respondent. There has been continual attempt by the Maintenance Enforcement Office (MEO) to enforce the arreears. The reason why income had to be imputed is because the respondent elected not to challenge the imputation of income made 10 years ago. It is not complete answer to the determination of an appropriate historical income for the respondent, who is now earning $88,808."

HELD: The appeal was dismissed and the award was confirmed. The respondent's application for enforcement of the award was granted without costs. 1)The issues were questions of fact not law. The errors complained of were the same questions referred to the arbitrator for determination. Adding the phrase 'difference in costs to the builder' did not convert the issue from one of fact to one of law. The wording on the second issue was changed slightly to read 'in his calculation as to damages awarded for increased costs of winter construction'. There was some evidence upon which the arbitrator could make a finding of fact. 2)As none of the bars set out in the Act applied the court was required by s50(3) to give judgment enforcing the award.  3)The application for costs on a solicitor and client basis was denied.

The arbitrator heard two days of viva voce evidence, admitted several documents as exhibits, received written legal briefs from counsel, and subsequently rendered a written decision that dealt with all the issues before him. The award was favourable in most respects to the position taken by the respondent. The errors complained about were the very questions that were referred to the arbitrator fordetermination.

6_1993canlii5662.txt,"The applicant sought to adduce fresh evidence on an appeal of a Family Court order which dismissed her application to terminate a permanent custody order respecting her son. Dismissing the application, that the evidence sought to be admitted was either available at trial and was not adduced, was repetitious of evidence given at trial, or was evidence which could not be expected to affect the decision.","This was an appeal from an order of the Family Court dismissing the appellant's application to terminate a permanent custody order respecting her son who had been taken into care by the Children's Aid Society shortly after his birth.

Palmer, [1980] 1 S.C.R. 759, [1988] 1 C.P.L. 1 and in the S.M.S. case, 'The fresh evidence rule', was applicable in this case. The application was based on the principles set forth in the Palmer decision, the criteria for the admission of evidence as enumerated in the Pugsley, JJ.A. concurring decision and the fact that, taken with the evidence adduced at trial, could not be expected to have affected the decision not to terminate the order for permanent care and custody of the appellant."

The petitioner alleged they separated in 1990 when the father left the province to seek work elsewhere. He sent no money for two years until 1992 when he sent $3,200 and bought a washer and dryer. She commenced a divorce action in 1996 which was adjourned sine die by consent. The marriage was dissolved in June 1998. The respondent did not keep records of money sent as he did not consider they had separated until 1993. HELD: The claim was dismissed. 1)Nothing turned on the actual date of separation which was difficult to determine. The mother was entitled to make a claim for support whenever she believed his contribution was inadequate, whether or not she perceived herself separated from him. 2)The primary purpose of a support order is not to compensate for past failure but to satisfy present need.

The appellant asserted the respondent acted fraudulently by failing to make full disclosure of the facts surrounding the cause of loss. Dismissing the appeal, that the respondent did not wilfully make any false statement, and answered all questions as required on the documents provided. Her silence in the face of uncertainty over her in-laws involvement in the fire did not constitute fraud. If the appellant expects an insured to comply with statutory conditions, it must reproduce them in the policy and provide a question on the proof of loss form to that effect.","This was an appeal from a decision dismissing the appellant's claim that the respondent conspired with her sister and brother-in-law to have the seasonal dwelling owned by the four respondents intentionally burned. The appellant claimed payment of $20,000 plus expenses associated with investigating and adjusting the loss. The respondent's claim was dismissed with costs of $1,200.00. In issue was whether the appellant conspired to set the cottage on fire; if so, whether the appellants breached the respondent's duty to make full disclosure under the insurance policy. The evidence was clear that the appellant did not know whether or not to believe the Nicholsons had arranged for the cottage to be burned; she did not make a false statement."
7_2010nssc146.txt,"The accused, who faced three counts of trafficking and possession for the purposes of trafficking, had negotiated agreements with the Crown that preserved her right to re-elect from a trial by judge and jury to a trial by judge alone and provided that she would not contest the admissibility of a video statement she had given to the police and, if a motion to dismiss at the conclusion of the Crown's case was unsuccessful, she would testify in her own defence. Following a voir dire and one-and-a-half days of trial, new evidence (which could be used to impeach the accused's credibility and contradict things she had told the police in the video statement) came to the Crown's attention. The accused argued that the admission of this new evidence would adversely affect her approach to the trial as important tactical decisions had been made on the strength of the Crown's previous disclosure. Mistrial declared; the accused is released from the undertakings and agreements made to date and has the right to re-elect her mode of trial. The late disclosure breached the accused's ability to make full answer and defence owing to the decisions she had already made regarding her defence and trial strategy and prejudiced her in a number of ways, which prejudice could not be cured by an adjournment or other order at this late stage. However, to proceed with the trial without the new evidence would be unfair to the Crown and compromise the court's 'truth seeking' function.","The accused applied for relief under s. 24(1) of the Charter alleging that the Crown's intention to lead newly discovered evidence compromises her s. and 11(d) Charter rights. She claimed she had no knowledge of the contents of the prisoner package seized following the search of Thomas Izzard and of the other evidence seized from her home pursuant to a search warrant executed soon thereafter. She sought exclusion of this evidence or a mistrial, with corollary relief. Mistrial in this case would be unfair to the Crown and would not be in society's interests generally because cases should be decided on all relevant and admissible evidence. This new evidence first came to Crown counsel's attention during a lunch break last week, following the hearing of a voir dire and a day and one-half of evidence in the trial proper. Defence counsel was immediately notified and disclosure was provided to defence counsel within 24 hours of the Crown learning of the new evidence. The accused moved for a continuation of the publication ban on the 'newly discovered evidence' mentioned in yesterday's decision and in the decision today. HELD: The accused was found guilty. She was relieved from her previous agreements and undertakings regarding trial process, agreements with respect to the video taped evidence and her right not to call defence evidence and to remain silent. The Court held that it was impossible to cure the prejudice of late disclosure to the accused by an order requiring her to re-elect. There was no breach of her right to make full answer and defence at trial, given that she had negotiated with her counsel prior to the discovery of the evidence, she was not prejudiced in any way, shape or form, by the disclosure of this new evidence, and her decision to not challenge its admissibility was not made lightly."

The appellant applied to adduce fresh evidence consisting of a letter from the Investigating Committee describing how it intended to proceed. The appellant argued the matter was disciplinary, not academic, and as it can ultimately result in his dismissal, he is entitled to procedural fairness, including a fair hearing, the right to cross-examination of witnesses, to call his own witnesses, to active legal representation and to full disclosure. He argued all committee members, except the union representative, should be excluded by reason of bias. HELD: The appeal was dismissed with costs on double Column V. 1)The material did not meet the test for the admission of fresh evidence. It simply restated what was at issue and found to have had no effect. 2)There was no tenable basis for interfering. The remedies are discretionary. 3)The Court was not prepared to grant the relief in any event, given the long delay in seeking recourse. The initial concern was bias and jurisdiction. The issue of whether the proceedings were academic or disciplinary was not raised until the application below. 4)The application was premature as there are other avenues of appeal provided in the regulations.

The appellant's counsel, the union's counsel and counsel for the university, raised the issue of bias on the part of the Committee. The Committee considered the matter and, by letter dated August 21, 2001, advised the appellant the committee would proceed as constituted. The appellant then brought the application for an order prohibiting the committee from proceeding further and ordering him reinstated as resident.

DATED at the City of Regina, in the Province of Saskatchewan, this 5th day of June, 2002 Appeal was dismissed with costs on double Column V. There was no tenable basis for interfering with the Chambers judge's disposition of the application. The remedies prayed for are discretionary by nature, the writs being writs of grace (see Harelkin v. University of Saskatchewan). Thus, the appellant must demonstrate the Chamber judge abused his discretion in exercising his discretion.

c_1998canlii13762.txt,"The plaintiffs sought a declaration that they had complied with the requirements of s27 of the Saskatchewan Farm Security Act and an order requiring the defendant to sell them the lands which were subject to their right of first refusal under the Act. The defendant objected on the basis the plaintiff did not meet the time frame requirements set out in s27(2)(b) as an unconditional and unequivocal letter of committment to finance the purchase had not been issued by the Farm Credit Corporation. The defendant counterclaimed for rent owing by the plaintiffs as overholding tenants. HELD: A declaration issued that the plaintiffs had complied with s27 of the Farm Security Act in exercising their right of first refusal and the defendant was to forthwith transfer the land to the plaintiffs for $629,280 on the usual trust conditions. The defendants' counterclaim was dismissed. 1)The defendant waived its right to insist on strict compliance with the legislation. Prior to the May letter the plaintiffs had complied with the original obligation to provide a letter of committment from a recognized financial institution. The request for a letter addressed to it from a financial institution was first made in May 1997 and was an attempt to unilaterally change the initial requirement imposed on the plaintiffs. 2)Both the wording of s27(2)(b)(ii) and the wording used by the defendant in its offer of first refusal refer to a letter of committment to finance. A letter of credit binding the financial institution to advance the money in any event would be beyond the means of most farmers who had recently experienced difficult financial circumstances. To interpret the letter of committment referred to in the Act in a manner that would exclude mortgage financing would eliminate the ability of most farmers to exercise the right of first refusal. There were no conditions precedent attached to the committment. 3)As the plaintiffs were entitled to relief the arguments concerning adequacy of notice from the defendant was not addressed. 4)The plaintiffs were awarded costs.","The plaintiffs sought a declaration that they have complied with the requirements of s. 27(2) of the Saskatchewan Farm Security Act and an order requiring the defendant to sell to them the lands which are the subject of their exercise of their right of first refusal under the Act.

The evidence was that although both parents were good parents, they had difficulty in resolving problems between them, causing a lack of communication. Allowing the mother's application, that because the day to day decision-making was problematic, it was necessary for one of the parties to be given final say.

His conclusion was that the injury was caused by the injury itself and nothing done by the defendants contributed to it in the manner that was expected of an emergency medicine specialist. 2)The primary issue was whether the defendants' performance was negligent. 3)The plaintiff did not reveal any of the possible signs of infection or of what to look for if infection set in.

The defendant counterclaimed for extras requested by the plaintiff. HELD: The plaintiff was awarded judgment for $7,654.61. The $4,000.83 withheld by the plaintiff was set off against this claim. 1)It was intended the round pillars would be part of the contract. They were not an extra that the plaintiff should be responsible for. 2)The steam room was an extra ordered by the plaintiff but he was entitled to rely upon the representations of the defendant as to cost. 3)The parties agreed the amount to be charged to the plaintiff was the actual cost to the defendant.

The charges were found to be fit and proper. 4)Aside from the basement drain, the plaintiff paid nothing for the repair of deficiencies. 5)The 4 month delay was attributable to both parties. The plaintiff enjoyed savings by way of not paying interest. He was entitled to recover one-half of the loss of potential rent and lost storage charges for the use of the garage due to the delay.  6)The deficiencies were relatively minor and the cost of repairing them at the time of the sale of the house in 1997 would not have exceeded $1,000. It is not uncommon for custom built luxury houses to sell for less than their original cost. 7)The claim against the individual defendant was dismissed as there was no evidence that he was a party to the construction contract or that he acted in any capacity other than that of an officer of the corporate defendant. 8)Costs may be spoken to.","The plaintiff engaged the defendant, D&S Homes Ltd., to construct a residence.

HELD: The appeal was dismissed. 1)There was no palpable or overriding error in the assessment of the evidence or in the interpretation or application of the law to the evidence. Findings of fact concerning the essential elements of care and control and impairment were supported by the evidence. The law outlined Shuparski and authorities cited within were properly applied when determining the appellant had care and control.  2)Stellato was correctly applied along with the tests and observations outlined in Landes and Hall in concluding his ability to operate the vehicle was impaired by alcohol. 3)While Burdett reflects the current state of the law governing circumstantial evidence, it remains subject to the rule in Hodge's case (1838). However this rule does not apply here because there was some direct evidence concerning his ability to operate the vehicle during the first time frame (R.v.Comba).

The learned trial judge drew an incorrect inference from the facts at trial, in finding the appellant had the care or control of the motor vehicle. HELD: The appeal was dismissed. The appellant's findings of fact concerning the essential elements of care and control and impairment by alcohol are supported by the evidence. Direct evidence confirms that the accused's condition did not change for the period that he was in the driver's seat and if impairment is indeed proven, which is the next issue will deal with, then it applies equally to when he was first observed in the vehicle as to later observed in it. Clearly impairment of ability to drive is an issue of fact to be found on all the evidence before the Court and must satisfy the Court beyond reasonable doubt.

Danelle's primary residence and where she will attend school will need to be resolved prior to her entering Grade 1. That is a matter that should be left to the trial judge. Applying a discretionary power, fact that serves to narrow the basis for intervention on appeal, is the Court of Appeal at liberty to interfere."
d_1997canlii11439.txt,"The petitioner sought an order under the Dependent's Relief Act that the younger child share equally with his brother in the estate of their deceased father. Neither the deceased's Will nor the codicil made in November and December 1989 respectively made provision for the second son born December 1989, subsequent to the separation of the parties. The elder son was the sole beneficiary and the farmlands were to be held in trust for him until he turned twenty-one. The younger son was diabetic and had extraordinary medical expenses. The eldest required braces. The mother's income was $1,089 per month. The deceased had been paying support in the amount of $150 per month per child pursuant to the 1991 divorce order. The mother sought an order under s17(4) of the Divorce Act varying child maintenance from $300 to $1,245 per month for the two children. The Executors did not oppose the application but put in issue the Estate's ability to support that level of maintenance. HELD: The younger child was entitled to share equally with his brother in the estate as a reasonable provision had not been made for his maintenance. Maintenance was varied to $900 per month for the two children.  1)Different considerations arise in the context of a Dependants' Relief Act application taken in conjunction with a variation application. The phrase 'reasonable provision' in s9(1) of the Dependants' Relief Act is to be no longer defined as that which would permit the dependent to maintain the standard of living enjoyed during the lifetime of the testator but is to be determined having regard to the testator's legal and moral obligations to the dependent and others (Ostrander). A more generous award may result. 2)The preservation of an inheritance until the children attain the age of twenty-one is not a predominant factor. The amount of maintenance is not, of necessity, tied to the standard of living experienced when the testator was alive or to the net income the Estate will generate subsequently. The court departed from the Guidelines for the reason the award was made in conjunction with a Dependent's Relief application, the income of the estate was currently unknown, but the court was satisfied that reasonable provision has been made for the children. 3)There was nothing in the Will, read as a whole with reference to the ordinary rules of construction which required the term personal effects to be given anything other than their ordinary meaning; with the clarification that the testator did not wish to preserve personal use vehicles. Thus, personal effects did not include grain, livestock, farm machinery, equipment or other assets related to the operations of the farm.  4)Counsel for both parties were entitled to their costs of the proceedings to be paid on a solicitor-client basis out of the estate.","The deceased made a will and codicil in November 1989 and December 11, 1989 respectively. Neither made any provision for the younger child. The will was subject to sale in the Executor's absolute discretion with the like discretion to apply the net income and to encroach on capital for the maintenance of the child until he reached the age of twenty-one years. The petitioner sought an order under the Dependents' Relief Act varying child maintenance from $150 per child to $1,245 per month for the two children. The executors did not oppose the application under the Wident's Relief Act but the petitioner's new spouse applied for a reduction in the amount owing on the division of matrimonial property. HELD: The estate was to be liquidated and the reasonable monthly expenses claimed on behalf of the children reduced to $250 per month. 1)The children were to receive their fair share of the estate.  2)The term 'personal effects' does not include grain, livestock, farm machinery, equipment or other assets related to the business oroperations of the farm. 3)Their needs were such that they required the monies sooner rather than later."
8_1997canlii11328.txt,"The two accused, both Metis, were separately charged in 1993 with six fishing offences relating to the use of nets. The accused who had ten nets on two lakes at the time of seizure admitted to being commercial fisherman. The Crown had stated to the defence that fishing for commercial purposes would not be an issue. The trial judge dismissed the defence motion for a direction that the Crown comply with his undertaking that the issue was whether the Metis of Northwestern Saskatchewan have an aboriginal right to fish for food. The Provincial Court Judge found both accused not guilty on three of the counts on the basis of standard criminal law defences but would have convicted on the other three charges but for the constitutional defence. The Crown appealed the acquittals based on the constitutional defence. Grounds for appeal included failure to distinguish between an Aboriginal right to fish for food and for commercial purposes; failure to find the accused were engaged in commercial fishing and that neither the accused nor their ancestors possessed an Aboriginal right to fish for commercial purposes; by concluding that scrip issued to Metis pursuant to s6(f) of the Dominion Lands Act and Order-Council did not extinguish any Aboriginal right to fish for food or commercial purposes; the trial judge erred by failing to conclude that the requirement to obtain a licence before fishing with a net was not a prima facie infringement of an existing aboriginal right to fish for food; in acquitting the accused when neither the Aboriginal rights defence nor equality rights defence had any application to the charge. The Saskatchewan Metis Nation and National Council were granted Intervenor status. HELD: 1)The first three grounds were dismissed. The trial judge found that the Crown had not breached an undertaking, nor misrepresented its position with respect to the constitutional issue but implicitly found that the respondents had been prejudiced through the misunderstanding during pre-trial communications between council as to the issues that would be argued during trial. The trial judge was entitled to find as fact that it was not the intention of the parties to confine the issue to commercial fishing. 2)Once it was determined the actual activity was fishing for the purpose of selling the fish, the only rights that could be said to be infringed were either the right to exchange fish for money or goods or the right to fish commercially (Gladstone). The aboriginal right to fish for food was no longer relevant because the evidence did not establish that as the activity they were engaged in. 3)The trial judge's finding that an Aboriginal right to fish existed in Metis persons of northwest Saskatchewan separate and apart from the issue of aboriginal title was one he was entitled to make and should not be disturbed. The case law makes it perfectly clear that aboriginal rights are site specific and the finding of a right in one group in one location does not establish the same right for another group in another location (Van der Peet). 4)There is no basis to distinguish between Indian and Metis people when considering whether a licensing requirement constitutes an infringement of the aboriginal right to fish for food. 5)The departmental policy which placed a higher priority on treaty Indian fishing than domestic licence food fishing for Metis persons constituted an infringement. Once an infringement is found the onus shifts to the Crown to demonstrate that the regulation is justifiable. The infringements could not be justified because they did not relate to any identifiable objective that made them necessary. 6)The trial judge should not have based his decision on the Charter when it was not part of the argument before him without first giving counsel the right to address the argument. 7)Since there is no requirement on a Metis person in the geographical area delineated to have a licence it followed that Regulation 27 requiring a person to legibly mark the licence number of the stakes was also an infringement that could not be justified.","The Crown appealed the acquittals of the respondents following trial on three charges related to fishing, in contravention of the Saskatchewan Fishery Regulations passed pursuant to the Fisheries Act. Each accused was separately charged with six offences arising out of fishing activities on two lakes in northwestern Saskatchewan on December 1, 1993. The Crown argued that the respondents were in fact commercial fishermen and had admitted in their evidence at trial that they would have sold some of the fish if they had caught any in their nets, that the only aboriginal right the Court should consider was an aboriginal right to fish for food. Subsequent to trial, defence counsel brought a motion requesting an order under s. 24(1) of the Charter of Rights and Freedoms directing the Crown to comply with his undertaking that commercial fishing was not an issue. HELD: The Crown's motion was granted. The respondents were Metis and reside at reasonably isolated Metis community named Turnor Lake. As this conflict is fundamental to the determination of this case, the trial judge found the accused not guilty on counts 1, 2 and 6 of the Constitution Act, 1867 along with the Rupert's Land and North-Western Territory Order passed in s. 146. It is the Crown's perspective, which is the constitutional defence that are the subject of this appeal. 1)It is the proper characterization of the aboriginal right one of fishing for food, because the offences with which the accused were charged did not relate to commercial fishing, but applied whether the fishing was for domestic consumption or for commercial purposes. 2)The Crown intended not by word or action to make commercial fishing the constitutional issue at least prior to their brief which gave rise to this motion. The appeal on this point is limited to the argument that such right was extinguished (appeal ground 4) and in any event the regulations are justified."

1990canlii4096.txt,"This was an application for an interim injunction restraining the respondents from further proceedings against the applicant, in particular restraining a sentencing hearing, in respect of charges of professional misconduct. The application was made pending the outcome of an application for certiorari quashing the decision of the disciplinary panel. The Appeal Court had refused to issue an interim injunction restraining the disciplinary hearing, holding that the courts should not interfere with the tribunal's proceedings until its completion except in very exceptional circumstances. In the case at hand, the applicant's counsel had requested an adjournment of the sentencing hearing on the ground that the applicant was medically unable to attend. The respondent's counsel then sought to settle the matter of penalty by written submission. The respondent's by-laws respecting penalty provided that the applicant shall be given the opportunity to appear and be heard. Dismissing the application for an interim injunction, that because the sentencing hearing was merely an extension of the disciplinary proceedings, rather than a new proceeding, the court was bound by the Appeal Court decision which held that the Court should not interfere with the proceedings of a quasi-judicial or other tribunal by interim injunction or stay except in very exceptional circumstances, which requirement, the Appeal Court had concluded, the applicant did not meet.","The respondent applied for an interim injunction restraining the respondents from further proceedings in respect of charges prosecuted against him pursuant to the constitution, bylaws and regulations of the Investment Dealers Association of Canada. The appellant argued that the American Cyanamid test was not applicable and that it was against the interest of other members of the Association to allow someone, who has been convicted of serious charges, to indefinitely postpone the imposition of penalty. Dismissing the application, that the applicant would suffer irreparable harm if the injunction were granted as the respondent was found guilty of professional misconduct. The appeal court reversed the decision of the trial judge and ordered the respondent to pay the whole or part of the costs of the proceedings before the court."
4_2005nspc10.txt,"The defendant was charged with possession of cannabis marijuana and possession of cocaine, both for the purposes of trafficking. When the police approached a group of youth standing around vehicles, through one of the vehicle's open windows they noticed two open bottles of beer. While searching the vehicle for liquor, they moved a knapsack on the floor to check under the seat; the knapsack felt heavy and it felt like there were bottles inside it. The police opened the knapsack and found beer bottles, narcotics and a large amount of cash. In the front pocket of the knapsack, the police found the defendant's wallet with identification and personal papers. They also found packages of cocaine in the console of the vehicle. The defendant, who was not the owner of the vehicle, was not present when the search was conducted. The owner of the vehicle testified that he had picked up the defendant in his vehicle earlier in the day and that the defendant had placed the knapsack in the vehicle. When the police arrived, they both got out of the vehicle and the defendant left. The defence argued that the evidence was all circumstantial. The defendant was found guilty on all charges. The evidence established that the defendant had handed the packages of cocaine found in the console of the vehicle to the vehicle's owner; thus the cocaine was in the defendant's personal possession initially and thereafter in the defendant's and his friend's joint possession. The knapsack was in the personal possession of the defendant when he entered the vehicle and no one else had access to it until the police seized it; the only reasonable inference to be drawn was not only that the knapsack was in the personal possession of the defendant but that since it contained items of such a personal nature and since the cocaine handed to the friend had come from the knapsack and no one else has access to it, the defendant must have had knowledge of all its contents and consented to them being there. The three rolls of cash were also in the possession of the defendant and since they were in such small denominations and were found in the same bag as the large amounts of cocaine and marijuana, rolled in the manner in which drug dealers commonly hold their cash, and as the defendant was a student the previous year and therefore unlikely to have large amounts of cash from any other source, the only reasonable inference was that the rolls of cash were the proceeds of drug trafficking.","The accused was charged with possession of marijuana, cocaine and cocaine for the purpose of trafficking, both under s. 5(2) of the Controlled Drugs and Substances Act and cocaine and a knapsack with a large amount of cash. At a subsequent search at the police station it was found to contain an unopened bottle of Olands Export Ale, 232 grams of cannabis marihuana, 63 grams of cocaine, bundles of cash containing $3000 in total, a digital scale and a black wallet were found in the accused's car and he was driving erratically. The accused was a student the previous year and was unlikely to have large amounts of cash from any other source, the only reasonable inference was that the drugs and cash were in his possession knowing they were obtained by the commission in Canada of an offence punishable by indictment. Accused found guilty of all three charges; the evidence seized was admissible against the accused. The evidence established that the accused had knowledge of the drug used in the possession of the accused and consented to its being there. Although the accused was not present on the wharf at the time of the investigation, the police officers seized a backpack stuffed with cash, a small amount of marijuana and cash, rolled in the manner used by drug dealers to hold their proceeds of sale. The lotto forms are commonly used to package cocaine for sale. Scales are used for weighing out the product. Possession of property obtained by crime; the Crown did not call evidence but argued that this was a circumstantial case in which the Crown had not proven beyond a reasonable doubt that the drug and money were in the defendant's possession. HELD: The Court found the accused guilty of three charges: possession of drugs, constructive possession, possession of cash and possession of stolen goods.  1) The Court accepted the evidence of Robinson, who was qualified as an expert in the use, availability, distribution, packaging, sale, price and value of cocaine and cannabis marijuana. Based on his training and experience, Robinson was able to establish that the substances seized by the police in this case were possessed for sale, not personal use. 2) The uncontroverted expert evidence establishes that the knapsacks containing cocaine, marijuana and cocaine must have contained items of such a personal nature, because the cocaine the defendant handed to Hyslop came from him and because no one else had access to them, the defendant must have given knowledge of all of its contents and, for the same reasons, consented and had some measure of control over"

His sole ground of appeal hinges on the court accepting fresh evidence. HELD: The application to adduce fresh evidence is dismissed. There being no ground of appeal other than that there would be a miscarriage of justice if the conviction were affirmed in light of the fresh evidence, the appeal is dismissed. 1) Applying the case law to the fresh evidence, they fail the test for admission. 2) With respect to the evidence of Megan Bairos and her friend, we still do not have this evidence before us.

Bodkin belonged to the appellant or to the complainant. The appellant denies living in the basement and denies being a seller of methamphetamine.

Lévesque in making this fresh evidence application. 2) There would be a miscarriage of justice if the conviction were affirmed in light of the fresh evidence, the appeal is dismissed. 3) With respect to the evidence of the complainant, she does not swear that the accused was selling methamphetamine on April 17, 2003, the date when the offence was alleged to have been committed. Some of the delay was, in part, the product of the Crown being unable to secure the testimony of the witness voluntarily.

b_2003nssf19.txt,"The Agency applied for the permanent care of four young children, aged 2 to 5 years. The three youngest children had been in the Agency's temporary care and the oldest child had been in the supervised care of her paternal grandparents. The family had come to the Agency's notice due to problems with money, food shortage and housing. Despite several years of assistance from a Family Skills Worker and Parent Aid, concerns remained as to the mother's willingness and ability to care for her children. The oldest child had continuously moved between her biological father's home (which was often with the mother) and her paternal grandparents. The biological father had custody of her at the present time. The paternal grandparents wanted custody of both the oldest and youngest children, whom they believed to be their son's children. Application granted; the oldest child to be placed in the supervised care of her paternal grandmother and the biological father is not to live in that home; both parents can have supervised carefully monitored access to that child (if access is not exercised by either party, that access will be terminated); the three youngest children are to be placed in the permanent care of the Agency for the purposes of adoption with both parents' access to these children to be weaned. Access between all four children will continue at least until it becomes impossible due to the current adoption law in the province. Although the expert evidence presented by the Agency was rejected due to its apparent lack of objectivity and the fact that the experts appeared biased by their access to the entire Children's Aid file which contained numerous unproven allegations, the court found that despite extensive remedial measures provided to the family, all four children would be at risk of harm if returned to either parent due to an environment of absence of necessities, multiple moves, one child having witnessed physical violence, medical needs not having been met, basic hygiene not having been met and basic supervision and safety concerns not having been met. The father failed to either protect the children or provide the necessities for them. Both parents were not willing to accept input from any professional. Neither parent could, nor wished to, change in the foreseeable future.","The Agency applied for permanent care of four children. The first child, S.M., was 5 years old at the time of her birth. The second child, O.D., was 3 years of age.

The Agency continued to visit the children until January 2002, when they separated again. By this time, the mother was already living with her grandparents, the Ls. and the fourth child (A.D.) was living with the grandparents. In February 2002, the Agency conducted a psychological assessment of the children and found that they were in need of protective services and that they had significant emotional distress and were prone to aggressive behavior.

The children had been out of their mother's care for several months and there was no evidence that any of this was done by the Agency. An assessment was held at Disposition Hearing on April 30, 2002 and the Agency concluded that the child had a mild to moderate to severe head lice infestation and that she would not be able to supervise adequately with the help of a caregiver or a person of the mother's experience. The child was placed with the Agency's temporary care unit and access was to be moved to a more comfortable location.

He requested two 1999 orders be amended to the extent necessary to give the relief requested. The brothers had been involved in a dispute over the division of farming assets since July 1999. A third party commenced legal action in QB No.3510/99 against the brothers and garnisheed revenues from the Pregnant Mare Urine operation for approximately 1 year. The brother's application for an injunction to permit him to take over the operation was dismissed in the January 12, 2001 fiat.

c_2003skqb58.txt,"Canadian veterans of the Korean War or World War II applied for certification of an action under the Class Actions Act. The plaintiffs claimed they and their dependents were treated differently than non-native war veterans by requiring benefits to be administered by the Department of Indian Affairs or through Indian agents and claimed damages for loss of benefits based on systemic negligence, breach of trust, breach of fiduciary duty and unjust enrichment. They alleged officials and Indian agents were negligent in carrying out their duties to inform the plaintiffs of their right to receive full and complete benefits and in some case agents misappropriated benefits. HELD: The application was dismissed. A class action is not the preferable procedure in the circumstances. The issue of discoverability relating to each plaintiff overwhelms any common issues. It is not possible to determine issues of discoverability in any global fashion. It will be necessary to have an inquiry into the state of mind of each individual plaintiff over a period of 40 years. Such a class action would be completely unmanageable and certification would result in a multitude of individual trials, which would completely override any advantage that might be derived from a trial of a few potential common issues. A finding that there was a trust relationship between veterans and the Crown as to the administration of benefits would not determine whether there was a breach of any such relationship without an inquiry into the facts and circumstances of each veteran on a case by case basis. Aside from limitation problems, individual determinations will be required in order to ascertain whether the individual has a cause of action including for breach of a fiduciary duty, if one existed, to properly inform each proposed plaintiff, what information each received, whether he understood the information and made an informed decision. The Crown did not seek costs.","The plaintiffs apply for certification under The Class Actions Act on behalf of the following classes as set forth in paragraph 5 of the statement of claim: (a) Veterans Resident Class Any Indian person who, as defined under the Indian Act, was not informed of nor was he offered any benefits that he was entitled to by reason of his service either in World War II or in the Korean War as did non-aboriginal veterans. The lengthy delay between the plaintiff's awareness of the symptoms in 1976 and her suit in 1993 could not simply be due to lack of a medical report. The Crown also alleges that the plaintiffs are statute-barred from receiving the Survivors' Pensions that they seek. HELD: The Court held that there were a number of limitations issues, some of which were common and others that would be individual to the class members. 1) The Court found that only if class members succeed in this litigation and reached the bureaucratic stage of applying for an ex gratia payment will the question of individual issues arise. The Court should be reluctant to deny a class member his or her day in court.  2) There are a limited number of resources available to the plaintiffs on a certification application. There is no bar to the bringing of motions even at the pre-certification stage of the proceedings. 3) The plaintiffs have failed to adequately describe an identifiable class; the proposed claims raise common issues which will advance the litigation proposed; to produce workable litigation; to demonstrate there are proposed plaintiffs who would fairly and adequately represent the interests of the class; and to demonstrate they do not have any interest potentially in conflict with other class members such as Indian War Veterans."
d_2005skca149.txt,"The respondent had just begun serving the community supervision portion of a custody and supervision order made pursuant to the Youth Criminal Justice Act when he walked away from his designated residence and breached the terms of the order. The provincial director immediately issued a warrant for his apprehension but he was not found until almost a month later. His case went to the Youth Court for review under s. 103 of the Act. The Youth Court judge interpreted the Act as meaning the respondent's sentence had continued to run while he was at large and had expired. She held that no action was required on the alleged breach of the custody and supervision order. The Crown appeals the decision. HELD: Appeal allowed. 1) The Youth Court judge erred in her interpretation of the Act. On a proper reading of the Act, the respondent was deemed not to be serving his sentence during the time period between when the warrant was issued and when he was apprehended. 2) A straightforward analysis of the Act serves to answer the question of whether the respondent's sentence continued to run while he was at large. Section 102(1) of the Act sets out the authority of the director, when a young person has breached or is about to breach a condition of his community supervision. The director may, pursuant to s. 102(1)(a), permit the young person to continue to serve his sentence in the community or, pursuant to s. 102(1)(b) of the Act, if the breach is serious and increases the risk to public safety, the director may order the young person to be remanded in custody until a review is conducted. Section 102(2) goes on to make s. 107 and s. 108 applicable to an order for remand and review made pursuant to s. 102(1)(b). Section 107(1) is the provision referred to by s. 102(2) that is of concern. There is an obvious modification of s. 107(1) which 'the circumstances require' when it applies in the context of a breach of the conditions of community supervision. That modification involves the notional deletion of the opening words of the subsection that refers to s. 106 and the substitution in their place of a reference to s. 102. This means two things. First it means that, when the director decides to issue an order under s. 102(1)(b) remanding a young person in custody until a review is conducted, the director has the authority to issue a warrant authorizing the apprehension of the young person. Second it means that if a warrant is issued, the young person's sentence does not run until he or she is apprehended. 3) The court went on to comment further on some of the considerations that seem to have led to the decision in the court below, including the purpose of the Act, the reference to s. 107 that is found in s. 102(2) and the relationship between the concept of the suspension of supervision and the running of the sentence itself.","The respondent had just begun serving the community supervision portion of his custody and supervision order made pursuant to the Youth Criminal Justice Act (YCJA) when he walked away from his designated residence and thereby breached the terms of the order. The provincial director immediately issued a warrant for his apprehension but he was not found by police until almost a month later. The Crown appealed the Youth Court judge's decision and argued that, on a proper reading of the YCJA, the respondent was deemed not to be serving his sentence during the time between when the warrant was issued and when he was apprehended. HELD: Appeal allowed. 1) The purpose of the legislation, the reference to s. 107 in s. 102(2) and the relationship between the concept of the suspension of supervision and the running of the sentence itself was inconsistent with the notion that the right of appeal particularized in ss. 109(4) to (8) arises only in relation to certain kinds of orders and, in particular, that it arises only when there has been an unsuccessful attempt to keep the young person in custody. The real question before the Court is whether the sentence was deemed to be continuing following the issuance of the warrant. It is not whether the provincial director had the power to suspend community supervision but, rather, whether the youth court judge erred in her interpretation of the law. 2) The youth justice court judge focused unduly on the provincial Director's lack of authority to'suspend' community supervision under s.102 and the contrast in this regard with the power of the director under s106 to suspend conditional supervision. This language is inconsistent with that of the C.K.W.R. (Re), 2005 ABPC 64 (CanLII). However, the courts in other cases have reached the same bottom-line conclusion as have. R. v. Zundel (1992), 95 D.L.R.(4th) 202 (SCC), 2005 SKPC 39 [unreported])."

The mother moved with the daughter to British Columbia in 1997. The parties did not agree upon ongoing access. HELD: The father's generous and far reaching requests were not reasonable at this time given his lengthy non-contact. It was important that he be reintroduced to his 10 year old daughter in a gradual and consistent fashion. He was granted access intitially for three and four hours in both provinces, then two days at the father's parent's home including overnight access and two days in the summer in British Columbia.

Each party had a different understanding of the duties of the Fund Development Officer which misunderstanding the Judge classified as a mutual mistake. The failure of performance by plaintiff entitled defendant to repudiate the contract. Defendant's counterclaim for rescission of first agreement, and repayment of monies paid under second agreement, failed where it accepted plaintiff's performance and paid consideration therefore.","This was an action brought by Fossil Fuel Development Ltd. against Tudex Petroleums Ltd.

The parol evidence rule applies and when there is a failure of a performance by a company in an essential part of a contract, the defendant was entitled to repudiate it. The defendant, having accepted the performance of Fossil on the marketing study and paid the consideration therefor, there is no basis for rescission of that agreement pertaining thereto. HELD: Fossil's claim was dismissed with costs. 1)There was no ambiguity. The claim of a breach by the defendant entitling it to damages must be denied. 2)A mutual mistake existed.

b_2012skqb443.txt,The parties were involved in a dispute regarding the custody of their children. The respondent husband sought to adduce as evidence an offer of settlement made by him to the petitioner. The respondent argued that he had waived any privilege regarding the proposal. HELD: The Court held that settlement proposals were privileged and that both parties jointly held it; the respondent could not unilaterally waive it. The Court denounced the respondent for exhibiting it to his affidavit as an attempt to infer that he was the better parent because the offer was so reasonable that only an unreasonable person would not accept it. The Court should only rarely be advised of settlement negotiations and even more rarely in chambers applications.,"FIAT: The application at bar is another salvo in a bitter custody and access dispute. HELD: 1) Settlement negotiations are protected by settlement privilege which is a jointly held privilege that cannot be waived by any one party acting alone. This privilege is fundamental to the policy interest of promoting settlement discussions as means to avoiding trial. It should only be set aside if there is a very compelling, competing policy warranting such a proposal. As settlement communications are almost always irrelevant to the issues that are properly considered by the Court, it is rare that there will be any competing policy or, indeed, any reason to reference them at all. A party cannot unilaterally waive privilege even on the proposal he made because it is not his to waive. 2) The respondent exhibited an affidavit that was from his counsel to the petitioner's counsel. It was marked 'Without Prejudice' and began with: 'My client has instructed me to forward the following without prejudice proposal in order to attempt settlement of the parties parenting and child support matters. Just as promised, the letter goes on to set out a detailed, comprehensive offer of settlement. Although the law is clear that settlement proposals should seldom be made known to the court, it happens too often and for no good reason. It is common sense that settlement is less likely if the parties do not engage in full and frank discussions; Few would initiate or participate in settlement negotiations at all if such could later be used to their detriment. 'What sensible man would attempt settlement if it could be used against him at trial?' This is gamesmanship and nothing more. Gamesmanship fouls that which the policy seeks to promote."
b_2005nssf21.txt,"The parties were married for 13 years and had three children. Both parties appeared to have a standard of living higher than their personal annual income would dictate; the husband by funneling many of his personal expenses through his company and the wife with the financial assistance of her parents. The wife sought lump sum spousal support to cover the cost of her tuition for a three year course in a divinity college. In addition to the matrimonial home, the parties owned various rental properties. Joint custody of the children ordered with primary day to day care to be with the wife; in the event that the parties cannot agree on any major issue concerning the children, the final decision will be made by the wife; income attributed to the husband for child support purposes; piano lessons and musical instruments found to be extraordinary expenses within the meaning of s. 7 of the Guidelines but soccer, tennis and horseback riding are not; no spousal support ordered; all property equally divided. The wife's father had given her one rental property from which the rental proceeds went to the mortgage and into the parties' joint bank account; the husband was extensively involved in the operation of the irproperty. This property was found to be a gift to the wife that became a matrimonial asset during the marriage as it was operated as a family venture. A second rental property was purchased by the husband and the wife's brother; the wife considered herself a partner in the venture even though her name was left off the deed. This property was also found to be a matrimonial asset.","The parties were married for thirteen years and had three children, aged 12, 11, and 9. The parties lived in the matrimonial home with the mother until they separated in 1991. The children have been residing with the father since their separation. The mother now sought spousal support pursuant to s. 7(1) of the Matrimonial Property Act. The father wants meaningful consultation and input into major decisions respecting the upbringing and activities of the children. The wife wants the final say when they cannot agree. Both are firmly settled into their local community. HELD: 1) This is a rental property held by a numbered company solely owned by the father. His access to the children every second weekend should include Sunday until 6:00 p.m. It is extraordinary expenses for extracurricular activities and are necessary and reasonable. The parents agree the children will have the opportunity to become involved in many activities in the future. They do not seek periodic support but rather a lump sum payment to cover her tuition at the Atlantic School of Theology. 2) There is no evidence that the parents pose a flight risk. There are several factors that suggest there is a serious economic disadvantage to the wife. The matrimony is palpable. The fact that the children have resided there for the past thirteen years does not change the fact that they love their father and wish to be with him. They have been involved in the family life since the separation and there is no question that they would benefit from his company, Bazoun Enterprises Ltd. However, the evidence of unnecessary repairs is not sufficient to move the children away from the appraisals. Given the standard of living enjoyed by the children, the Court ordered the parents to share these expenses equally."
8_2007skpc1.txt,"The accused applies for relief pursuant to the Charter on the basis of post-charge delay denying her the right to have her trial in a reasonable time. HELD: There was a Charter breach and the appropriate remedy is a stay of proceedings.  1) The length of delay in this case from the date of charge to the date of trial is approximately 31 months. The Supreme Court proposed as a general guideline a delay of 8 to 10 months in Provincial Court as acceptable. This is consistent with the reality in Buffalo Narrows, where trials are set within 6 months of entering a plea. 2) 12 months of the delay can be attributed to the accused. 6 months was deducted from the delay for inherent time requirements in arranging for the accused's appearance in Court. The remaining delay of 13 months is either attributable to the Crown or caused by factors outside the control of the accused. 3) In this case the accused has suffered actual prejudice in that the delay in bringing this matter to Court from the time of swearing the Information to the date of trial has prejudiced the accused's ability to make full answer and defence and her right to a fair trial. While the restrictions on employment opportunities caused some prejudice, this could have been overcome by applications to amend her conditions of release. 4) There have been four trial dates set on these charges, resulting in a lengthy delay to a verdict being reached. No explanation is offered for the adjournments except for the last adjournment caused by bad weather.","The accused applies for relief pursuant to the Charter of Rights on the basis of post-charge delay denying her the right to have her trial in a reasonable time. There was a Charter breach and the appropriate remedy was a stay of proceedings. HELD: The application is granted. 1) There has been a breach of the accused's Charter rights. Fairness to the accused requires that even for offences such as these that trials be held within reasonable period of time so that the accused does not suffer undue prejudice and so that her ability to apply for higher-paying job opportunities and to properly defend against the charges can also be defended. There have been four trial dates set on these charges, resulting in a lengthy delay to a verdict being reached on the charges. 2) There is no evidence that any lack of institutional resources caused any delays.  3) The accused did not contribute to the delay. There were some delays attributable to her in time until she was ready to enter pleas, and later until she could have the matter rescheduled for trial. Otherwise, she appeared on all court dates and was diligent about having the charges set. 4) The weather caused delay of two months. The total delay of twelve months is twelve. The remaining delay is 12 months. Inherent time requirements deduct this six-month period from the delay being considered. The length of delay is either attributable to the Crown or caused by factors outside her control. Limitations on institutional resources (see Morin, 2006 Charter motion argued and decision reserved to this date). 5) With regard to the cause of delay, the Court found there was no waiver of the delay caused by the adjournments from the dates of December 2005 and June 2006. It was not a waiver from December 2005 but it must be clear and unequivocal. The endorsement is silent as to waiver from 2005 and clearly indicates there is no waiver from June."
3_2000canlii19612.txt,"The plaintiffs claim for crop damage caused by the defendant's cattle entering the plaintiff's canola field. The defendant denies he is responsible or negligent, but admits his cattle were in the field.HELD: Damages were awarded in the amount of $2,533.45. The court valued the loss at $3,052.36. It then deducted 2% attributed to wild animal damage, 5% for the plaintiffs failure to calculate actual yield from the rest of the crop, 5% that the plaintiffs would have paid in dockage and 5% for the cost of production. Civil liability for crop damage caused by cattle flows from the Stray Animals Act. A cattle owner is strictly liable for damages caused by his straying cattle.  This liability may possibly even be absolute and only an act of god may serve as a defence. The issue here is the quantum of the damage. The fact that the defendant was refused access to the plaintiff's property to repair the fence has no bearing on liability in this case. An independent adjuster assessed the damage at 557 bushels. The court found on the facts that the damage was caused exclusively by the defendant's cattle on several occasions.","The plaintiff's claim against the defendant is for crop damage sustained as a result of the defendant's cattle getting into her canola field in late July, 1999. The plaintiff admits that his cattle were in the plaintiff's canola crop on one occasion. The defendant denies liability under s.27 of the Stray Animals Act and further denies that he was negligent in looking after his cattle. HELD: Judgment was granted in favour of the plaintiff and the defendants together with pre-judgment interest from January 2000 and costs. Under both the present and pre-1977 statutes the cattle owner is strictly liable for damage caused by his straying cattle. The fact remains that the cattle did move onto the field unbeknownst to the defendant, his spouse, his brother, or his hired help. The Carrot River did not prove to be an impediment on this occasion. There was no evidence credibly suggesting that water levels would have hindered the cattle on earlier occasions. They did not measure, estimate or make note of the number of bushels or tonnes of crop loss. The trial judge found that although the plaintiffs had been unable to combine most of the field, they had been put to the expense and inconvenience of having to combine around the numerous yard-square plots and poor areas and combine those plots separately, reduce the damages by only 5% for this factor. The damages sustained by the plaintiffs were reduced as a consequence of the entry of the cattle by the defendants."

The bankrupt contended that s241 of the Income Tax Act prohibits disclosure of tax information concerning both the bankrupt's common law spouse and the company of which she was sole director and shareholder. The second preliminary issue raised was that portions of an affidavit were based upon information and belief as opposed to personal knowledge as required by Queen's Bench Rule 319 for a final matter. HELD: A conditional order of discharge issued requiring the bankrupt to pay $1,750 from any source to the trustee by monthly installments of $100 per month. Judgment interest would accrue on any arrears.  1)This discharge hearing related to Nick Morin. The relevance of the tardiness in remitting goods and services tax of his common law spouse's company was questionable. The information was confidential and disclosure would be improper for these proceedings. The principle and exemption contained in s295(5)(a) of the Excise tax Act would not allow disclosure of goods and services tax remittances in these proceedings. 2)None of the alleged facts raised pursuant to ss173(1)(a),(b),(d),(f) and (m) were proved. It was not proven as outlined in s173(1)(f) that the bankrupt put them through unnecessary expenses by a frivolous and vexatious defence to the action. The conclusion of the investigation conducted by the RCMP as a result of the superintendent's investigation order was that the evidence would not support a successful prosecution.","The bankrupt filed two preliminary objections to his discharge. The first concerned the use of tax information concerning his common law spouse. The bankrupt challenged the validity of s.173(1)(a) of the Income Tax Act, alleging that s.241 of the Act prohibited the disclosure of this information. HELD: 1)Rule 319 of the Queen's Bench Rules requires that affidavit evidence must be based upon information and belief as opposed to personal knowledge. The Court cannot accept that the principle and exemption contained in s.295(5)(a of the Excise Tax Act would allow disclosure of information which is proprietary and is not improper for these proceedings. 2)The bankrupt's argument was that the evidence would not support a successful prosecution. The evidence did not support his claim based upon unsubstantiated allegations of tax evasion.  3)Two preliminary objections were raised to the discharge. 1)The information disclosed in paragraph 19 was confidential and was not to be opened other than for purposes of appeals. This objection was raised at the last minute. Counsel for the bankrupt could not remember the rule number other than he knew it was rule number 319. 4)The determination of the proper order was difficult. The objecting creditor sought a conditional order of discharge requiring the bankrupt to pay $1,750 from any source to the trustee. The applicant's motivation was genuine and disclosure was improper."
2_2009nspc21.txt,"The defendant farmer pled guilty to failing to take every precaution that was reasonable in the circumstances to ensure the health and safety of persons in the workplace, after a young employee drowned in a manure pit that was not properly secured due to a damaged barricade having been removed while a new one was on order. Defendant sentenced to fine of $25,000, from which the sum of $15,000 shall be paid to the Canadian Farmers' Disability Registry; defendant ordered to perform 160 hours of community service with respect to farm safety. The defendant was an individual and not a huge corporation, had been conscientious about safety issues prior to this incident and had endeavored to improve safety at his farm after the incident; the deceased had also failed in his responsibilities under the Act and was working with a significant blood alcohol content.","Mark Sutherland, a family dairy farmer, pleaded guilty to an offence under the Occupational Health and Safety Act for failing to take every precaution that is reasonable in the circumstances to ensure the health and safety of persons at the workplace. His guilty plea relates to the fact that there was a manure pit on the farm that did not have a barrier. The tragedy unfolded in a matter of minutes after he got to the farm. His blood alcohol concentration was significantly over the legal limit for operating any kind of vehicle. He had made substantial changes to his farm since the tragedy of the dairy farmer's death. These plans were in the works before the tragedy, including a safer method for disposing of manure through gravity fed gratings that the Sutherland designed himself. He was in no condition to be operating equipment, which he needed to do to remove manure from the manure pit, and placed himself at risk. HELD: The Court accepted the submission that a $25,000 penalty was a significant penalty and that the penalty should include significant contribution by the Sutherland to farm safety initiatives. Nothing can bring Mr. Boake back to life but the experience of the tragedy and, importantly, the Sutherland's knowledge of addressing farm safety issues, can assist in preventing the loss of another life. The farm was inherently dangerous and farm work being inherently dangerous, accidents are daily risk. Mr. Sutherland was conscientious about safety issues before and during his farming career and had endeavored to address and improve safety at his farm. He has made substantial improvements to his dairy farm in the past few years. This case does not lend itself easily to comparisons. The Court was satisfied that the respondent's failure was in not securing the barricade which had its damaged barricade removed while a new one was on order, or not arranging for an alternative to using the pit, alternatives that did exist at the time. It is material to me as well that the evidence in Exhibit 1 containing diagrams and photographs of the farm, and the submissions of Mr. Yuill indicate clearly that he had been out all night at social event, had been drinking and had not slept. Nevertheless, he was responsible enough to show up for his job at the Sutherland dairy farm since August 2006, including building a new dairy barn and working on a number of safety initiatives that he was not the kind of young man to let an employer down by not showing up. This was a case where it could be said that the failure was a substantial one, which could lead to fines in the amount of $250,000."

The mother was the successful party and income was imputed by the court to the respondent.  Held, costs in the amount of $3,000 are awarded against the father. The father's position caused unnecessary time, effort and delay. The court referenced L. (N.D.) v. L. (M.S.) (2010) to summarize the principles and case law relevant to determining a cost award under Rule 77. Determining costs in a matrimonial manner is more complex given mixed outcomes and the burden of costs placed on families and children such that the court may need to exercise discretion and move away from a strict application on tariffs.","The parties litigated the apportionment of custody and access rights and the quantification of child support and special expenses for their two children. The respondent, who was the successful party, sought an award of costs valued at $3,000 based on an application of Scale of Tariff 'A' of the Costs and Fees Act, supra. The tariff is reproduced following Rule 77.18. The court imputed an income level to the applicant that Ms. Pellicer was prepared to accept prior to the commencement of the hearing ($25,000) and assigned additional time to resolve disagreements between the parties. On the important parenting issue, the evidence established that the Applicant was the appropriate primary care parent. The applicant's initiative in seeking to vary the existing order was not reasonable and responsible.

The Crown argued that because several persons have told the police that this youth committed a serious offence, I should confine her in a custody even before she has a trial, pre-trial, before someone has given evidence in a Court of Law, and after she has had a trial to prevent further offences on her part. The Oppenheimer Centre for Public Policy wrote: The public is aware that we do not keep a person in custody simply because they are accused of committing an offence. There must be a necessary, substantial reason and the youth will create a nuisance and a danger to the community. If the youth is convicted at trial, the public will be aware that the appropriate sentence, according to law, will be imposed. They will also continue to monitor the youth's activities in the community and will assist in the prosecution of her case. There is no evidence at all that the teen will be danger if released, or that her release will cause any other danger to her. She is a valued member of our community and would be a valuable asset to our community."

However, he is also the sole shareholder of a corporation and the 50% owner of another corporation. The corporations have been very profitable and the retained earnings of both companies far exceed the amount of long term debt. HELD: 1) The respondent has deemed additional income of $50,000 and $27,200 from the two companies. 2) The imputed annual income of the respondent is $150,000. 3) Costs in the amount of $750 to the petitioner.","The issue between the parties was the amount of child maintenance payable by the respondent to the petitioner for the benefit of Brady Melvin, born January 1993. The amount of the respondent's income, as reported in his income tax return for the years 2001, 2002, and 2003 was $71,501, $73,272 and $74,476. He asserted that the indebtedness of the company was $1,600,000. However, nearly $400,000 of that debt represents shareholders loans. HELD: The respondent was ordered to pay $150,000 as maintenance for the child for the period January 1, 2004 to July 31, 2004 on the basis of his annual income of $72,800. The sum of $561.00 per month was to be paid in installments of the child's hockey expenses in August 2003 and September 2003 based on the total hockey expenses incurred in that year. 1)The respondent's annual income from both companies was $50,000 and he was the sole shareholder of Canadian Well Servicing Ltd.

The Court will not set aside the order nisi for judicial sale on the basis that the application for leave was premature or that the statement of claim was not noted for default. However, the application for confirmation of the sale is premature as the property is to be listed for 6 months. There does not appear on the evidence to be a sale to be confirmed. The plaintiff is prepared to make an offer, but does not appear to have done so. The draft bill of costs submitted contains numerous items which occurred prior to the granting of leave and there is no order from the Court authorizing pre-leave costs, nor any evidence as to why the Court might consider pre-leave costs. On a renewed application for confirmation of judicial sale, it would be preferable to have evidence directly from the listing agent setting out the steps taken to market the property and detailing for the Court any offers received. There will be no costs awarded for this unsuccessful application.","FIAT: The plaintiff seeks an order confirming the order nisi for judicial sale. The defendants entered into a mortgage with the plaintiff in April 2005 for land described as 'Lot 4, Block 17, Plan No. 85SC07177, Extension 0, Burstall. The mortgage was renewed for a year period with a maturity date of March 14, 2008. The plaintiff applied ex parte for an appointment for hearing of an application pursuant to the Act for leave to commence an action. This was not in compliance with s. 3(2) of the Act which prescribes that an application may be brought after the expiration of 30 clear days from the date of service on the Provincial Mediation Board. HELD: The application for confirmation of the sale is premature as the property is to be listed for six months, and on the basis that there is no sale to be confirmed based on the evidence filed. An appointment for a hearing was granted and the hearing was set for April 21/2008. Counsel invites the court to apply Rule 5(1) with respect to the irregularities identified. A decision is made on the application for the sale of the land and the statement of claim is not noted for default. There is limited evidence regarding the value of the property and no evidence from the licensed realtor who was charged with the responsibility of listing the property as to the steps taken.

d_2009skqb517.txt,"Counsel for the plaintiffs brings two notices of motion seeking 1) the opportunity to cross-examine a deponent on her affidavit and 2) an order to compel one of defendants to supply pre-certification notices to all persons who may be eligible to participate in the class action that is contemplated. HELD: The motions are dismissed with no order as to costs.  1) One of defendants contends that 7 people alleged by the plaintiffs to be viable class members have already entered into a full and final settlement with the defendant. This defendant earlier sought to examine these individuals. The Justice of this action at that time did not allow the examination but instead made an order permitting the defendant to file affidavits on the issue. This is the source of the affidavit the plaintiff seeks cross-examination on. The order also allowed the plaintiffs to file reply affidavits, which they chose not to do. There is nothing in the original order that could be interpreted as saying that the plaintiffs could cross-examine on the affidavit. In the view of the Court, having chosen not to file reply affidavits pursuant to the original order, it is not reasonable for plaintiff's counsel to embark on a totally different approach several weeks after the deadline has passed. There is also some concern that the actual purpose of the proposed cross-examination would be more general and broad-ranging than a mere challenge to the defendant's assertion that the individuals at issue have already entered into full and final settlements with the defendant.  2) In its barest sense, plaintiffs' counsel requests that the defendant supply a plaintiff by way of sending pre-certification notices to its clients. The Court is aware of Lewis v. Shell, where an Ontario court ordered notice to potential class members. However, that case is not similar to this case. In the Lewis case, the Court was faced with concern over the defendant contacting individuals who might be potential class members for the purpose of obtaining early settlements. Moreover, the Ontario class actions legislation is less restrictive than Saskatchewan's. The section of the Class Action Act which may permit such an order refer to a 'class action,' not an 'action.' As this case is still in the pre-certification stage, it is not yet a class action within the meaning of the Act. Spavier v. Canada also indicates that pre-certification motions of this sort would rarely be successful in this jurisdiction.","The defendant brought a motion pursuant to s. 12 of The Class Actions Act for an order compelling the plaintiff to produce a list of proposed class members who had been provided with a letter and related package by the defendant (relating to a test of their premises for contamination). The plaintiffs sought to have the action proceed as a class action on the basis that the defendants failed to provide basic water services at various Holguin resorts including the 1) Playa Costa Verde Beach, (3) Club Covarrubias, (6) Grand Playa Pesquero, (7) Brisas Guardalavaca and (8) Sol Rio de Luna Mares. HELD: The motion was dismissed.  1) The Court's inherent jurisdiction is to be exercised judicially and only when the relief sought cannot reasonable and realistically be obtained by the applications in some other lawful manner. 2) It is important to remember that we are in the pre-certification stage of this proceeding. This is still an 'action' and not a 'class action' as defined by s. 14 or s. 24 of the Class Action Act. It would appear that the court was concentrating more on common law regarding preliminary conflict objection. 3) The plaintiff was given ample time and opportunity to prepare her affidavit. The examination of the plaintiff could lead to a multitude of issues such as production of documents, undertakings and undertakings. It is not open to the plaintiffs to make use of either section at this time."
d_2010skca52.txt,"The appellant contests an order for $600.00 monthly spousal support given by a Chambers judge on an application to review a previous order which granted the respondent $300.00 monthly spousal support for a period of 1 year. The parties were married for 24 years following a 2-year period of cohabitation. They have 2 adult children, one of which is largely supported by the appellant. Both parties have some health problems. Originally, the appellant was ordered to pay the respondent $300.00 in monthly spousal support for a period of 1 year. Given the appellant's health difficulties and the fact that he was nearing retirement, the trial judge noted that the respondent would do well to become self-sufficient as soon as possible. The Chambers judge who reviewed the original order found that, during the year period the respondent was collecting spousal support, she had not engaged in any gainful employment. She had sold her house and used the proceeds to spend over 4 months living in Hawaii and Jamaica. She obtained probationary employment just after filing a notice of motion but lost the job before the hearing commenced. HELD: The appeal is allowed, the orders of the Chambers judge for spousal support and costs against the appellant are set aside. The Chambers judge imputed an income of $14,289 to the respondent on the basis that she was capable of working 30 hours per week at minimum wage. He did not indicate why he did not find her capable of full time employment. The Chambers judge made an error in calculating the income of the appellant. He also discounted the expenses borne by the appellant in relation the maintenance of their adult child, who was a full-time student. It was incumbent on the respondent to establish that she was unable to become self-sufficient. The evidence did not begin to establish that and, in fact, clearly showed that she made little effort to do so within the year allocated by the trial judge.","This appeal from a spousal support order was allowed orally from the bench for the reasons set out. It was clear that Ottenbreit J. had set an order for fixed and short term in order to give the respondent an opportunity to find appropriate employment and become self sufficient. The parties had separated in 2003 after 24 years of marriage following two years of cohabitation. The respondent was 60 years old and the appellant was 53. She had been diagnosed with breast cancer in 2005, had had surgery followed up by radiation, and had had shingles and an attack in the nature of stroke in March 2006. The appellant suffers from Hepatitis C. The chambers judge imputed an income to the respondent of $14,289 based on the assumption she was capable of working 30 hours week at minimum wage, although she testified that she was disabled and did not indicate she was able to work. This was an error as it failed to take into account employment expenses of $8,822 allowed by Canada Revenue Agency and expressly found by the chambers judge to be reasonable."

The applicant, which leased six school buildings from the Roman Catholic Church, submitted the respondent was required to reimburse the applicant for leasing costs. For the respondent, that the Education Act requires a request be made of the Minister in proper form and receive Governor in Council approval. Because the applicant failed to report to the Minister, the respondent was not required to pay the leasing costs. Where the Minister received a request in the proper form and where it was determined leases were necessary, the leasing costs would be the respondent's responsibility.","The applicant school board sought a declaration that the Province was responsible to provide school buildings required for the delivery of a basic Public School Program. Included in the fifty-five schools are six school buildings leased by the Cape Breton Board from the Catholic Episcopal Corporation of Antigonish or other entities of the Roman Catholic Church (the ""Church""). It is the responsibility for the leasing of the buildings that is now before the Court. The issue is whether the Minister of Education (the 'Minister') is required to reimburse the board for the costs incurred by the board in leasing these school buildings from the Church. Although the Province is not required to pay the cost of providing school buildings, the Court found that the Board was entitled to use funds that could have been available to meet other educational programs and services in order to pay these leases. The Court ordered the payment of the leasing expenses to the Board."
7_1996canlii7107.txt,"The respondent applied to reduce on-going maintenance from $600 per month for his two children and to reduce the accumulated arrears of approximately $14,600. The original corollary relief was made in 1989. An application for variation was dismissed in 1993 except that an order suspending the enforcement of the arrears during the times the respondent was unemployed was granted. The petitioner who had custody of the children and resided in Manitoba was employed. She requested that the matter be dealt with summarily on affidavit evidence and did not want a trial of the issue. HELD: The respondent was to pay $300 per month per child in the months when his gross earnings are $2,200 or greater and $150 per month per child when they are less. Arrears were reduced by $7,000. When he earned more than $2,200 per month he was to pay $200 per month on arrears in addition to the on-going child support obligation. The 1993 order was continued and it was further ordered that the respondent file quarterly a financial statement or cheque stubs evidencing his income with the maintenance enforcement office. 1)There was a significant reduction in the respondent's income since 1994, therefore there was a material change in circumstances. 2)The respondent had not provided specific information about the number of months he was in receipt of social assistance. It was clear, however, that his income during 1995 and 1996 did not allow him to meet his support obligations. Since his employment was uncertain a flexible order was appropriate.","The father applied to reduce the amount of unpaid child support owed to his 2 daughters from $600 per month to $14,600. The original corollary relief judgment was made in 1989 except that an order suspending enforcement of arrears during periods when the respondent was unemployed was granted. HELD: A flexible order was ordered. The father was ordered to pay child support of $300 per child per child during months when his gross monthly earnings are $2,200 or greater and $150.00 per child for a total of $5,200.00. Arrears were reduced by $7,000 and a further $200 was added to the on-going child support obligation. 1)Given the significant reduction in income experienced by the respondent since 1994, there has been a material change in circumstances. Since his employment is uncertain in his trade a flexible order would be appropriate. 2)The father had not provided specific information about the number of months he was in receipt of social assistance benefits. However it was clear that his income during 1995 and 1996 did not allow him to meet his support obligations. 3)The obligation was reduced by one-half."
b_1999canlii12595.txt,"The applicant applies for amendment of the judgment dated March 19, 1999 as it relates to costs. At the end of trial, the applicant requested the Court to reserve on the matter of costs. The applicant intended to make a submission for award of solicitor and clients costs. Evidence was led at trial about insubstantial offers made directly between the parties. Further evidence now indicates that substantial offers were made through council although not led at trial. The applicant argues that solicitor and client costs of $70,000 should be awarded because the offer to settle of $250,000 is close to the total judgment award of $230,000 including party and party costs of $20,000. The respondent takes the position that the estate was willing to pay reasonable maintenance costs and the quantum of maintenance could have been summarily determined without the necessity of extensive discoveries and without a lengthy trial. The respondent submits the approach of a needs-based assessment was upheld by the judgment and is always the approach always taken on behalf of the estate. The respondent argues the real question is whether the parties were acting bona fide during their negotiations and the issue should not be determined on the basis of the closeness of the offers. HELD: Solicitor and Client Costs of $70,000 are not appropriate in this case. The applicant's conduct was not entirely pure. The applicant was made aware in a prior judgment that under The Dependants' Relief Act there is nothing to indicate that a person is entitled to part of an estate as a beneficiary but rather that a beneficiary is entitled to maintenance. In spite of this ruling the applicant continued to claim the whole of the estate and to pursue full disclosure of the financial worth of the estate. Solicitor and client costs are within the discretion of the court but such discretion is exercise only in rare and exceptional circumstances. The conduct of the respondent cannot be characterized as reprehensible, scandalous or outrageous. The respondent's unwillingness to make full financial disclosure did contribute to the increase of costs but is insufficient to merit full solicitor and client costs. The Court awards fixed costs to the applicant in the amount of $47,000 together with disbursements.","The applicant applies for amendment of the judgment insofar as it relates to costs. At the conclusion of trial, counsel requested that costs be reserved on the basis of Column IV, Schedule 1B of the Tariff of Costs. It is now clear that the applicant intended to make a submission for award of solicitor and client costs of approximately $70,000. Evidence was led at trial about insubstantial offers made directly between the parties. The further evidence now shows that substantial offers were made through counsel, although that evidence was not before the Court at trial. The applicant characterizes herself as the successful litigant. HELD: 1)The applicant was awarded fixed costs in the amount of $47,000, together with disbursements.  2)It is incumbent upon the Court not to permit unnecessary litigation to be paid for by the estate. There is a substantial monetary difference between the party and party costs awarded in the judgment and the solicitor & client costs claimed by the applicant; there is a needs-based approach to assess maintenance, as dictated by The Dependants' Relief Act, 1996. This general principle is applicable here. The judgment in March 1999 created a debt owing to the applicant from the respondent and the debt became due and payable on the date of pronouncement, being March 19, 1999. The Executions Act states that interest runs 'from the time of entering judgment'. The Court is faced with two equally untenable positions in determining the costs. If the costs of the litigation were to be ordered out of the award, the remainder may be insufficient to meet the applicant's anticipated needs. This is not an appropriate case in which to order full solicitor/client costs.  3)In fixing an amount, have considered the principles in Nalder v. Hawkins (1833), Myl. K. 243; 39 E.R. 937 in Re Champ (1986), 1986 CanLII 3001 (SK QB), or where there has been reprehensible, scandalous or outrageous conduct meriting the court's censure. In Delaire v. Delaire, the applicant continued to claim the whole of the estate and, following the pre-trial conference, to pursue full disclosure of the financial worth of the Estate.  4)In this case, the respondent's position that the $200,000 award will not be paid until formal judgment is taken out was not entirely pure. It was appropriate to consider costs after trial."

The wife disagreed and a trial of this issue was directed and determined in the husband's favour. The wife appealed. HELD: Appeal allowed.  1)Since the judgment of this Court in Childs v. Childs Estate, [1988] 1 W.W.R. 746, there is no doubt that a judge has the power, under Rule 7 of s. 44 of The Queen's Bench Act, R.S.S. 1978, c. Q-1, to enforce or set aside an agreement compromising an action by summary proceedings. The law as stated in that judgment applies as well to agreements or settlements reached during the course of pre-trial conferences. 2)Parties will not usually intend to settle selected issues on a piecemeal basis, but rather will reach tentative agreements on selected issues conditional on an overall settlement agreement being concluded. Such was the parties' intention in this case, and accordingly, there was no settlement contract for the judge in the court below to enforce.  3)This is not to say that parties cannot reach several separate independent, binding and enforceable agreements as part of an effort to reach an overall settlement of the matters in issue between them, but in order to do so, the intention of the parties to settle on a piecemeal or installment basis must be clear. Nothing in the evidence indicated such an intention in this case. 4)In cases of settlement agreements reached at a pre- trial conference, the application to enforce, or to set aside, should be made under Rule 7 of s. 44 of The Queen's Bench Act as was done in Childs and not under Rule 184A as was the developing practice.","This was an appeal from an order which determined, after trial of an issue, that the parties had reached a binding agreement as to the value of the appellant's pension plan during negotiations which took place during a series of pre-trial conferences. HELD: The appeal was allowed from the bench with written reasons to follow. 1)The parties cannot reach several separate independent, binding and enforceable agreements as part of an effort to reach an overall settlement of the matters in issue between them, but in order to do so, the intention of the parties to settle on a piecemeal or instalment basis must be clear. 2)Nothing in the evidence indicates such an intention in this case. 3)The fiat ended: Pre-trial for continuation with respect to maintenance, jewellery and debts of the wife incurred."

The plaintiff has the prima facie right to select the forum subject to the defendant's right to establish that the forum is non conveniens. In the absence of many facts about the circumstances surrounding the accident and the witnesses likely to be called by the defendant, Nova Scotia is the forum conveniens. The substantive law governing the proceeding will be the law of the place where the accident occurred and the governing procedural law will be the law of the place of the trial.","The plaintiff filed an application for directions in the determination of a question of law pursuant to Rule 25.01 and, secondly, to dismiss the action for forum non conveniens that was refused.

e_2010skca8.txt,"Fulltext of judgment follows: Following the conviction of the respondent on a charge of trafficking in morphine contrary to section 5(1) of the Controlled Drugs and Substances Act, the prosecutor asked the sentencing judge to make a DNA order under section 487.051(3) of the Criminal Code. The judge declined to do so for the reason this was the respondent's first drug offence and she had no record of violence. With respect, we are of the opinion the judge erred in declining to make the order. The error lay in the judge's failure to have regard for the offender's record as a wholeÃ¹she has 53 prior convictionsÃ¹and to have adequate regard for the objectives of section 487.051 as identified in R. v. Briggs 2001 CanLII 24113 (ON C.A.), (2001), 45 C.R. (5th) 99 (Ont. C.A.). In light of the nature of the respondent's current offence, her lengthy record, her history of recidivism, and the relatively modest impact an order would have on her privacy and security interests, we are satisfied an order should have been made. Accordingly, and in the best interests of the administration of justice, there will be an order under section 487.051(3) in Form 5.04 for the taking of bodily samples from the respondent. If any directions should be required in relation to the execution of the order, the parties are given leave to informally apply for such directions through the Registrar's office.","Following the conviction of the respondent on a charge of trafficking in morphine contrary to s. 5(1) of the Controlled Drugs and Substances Act, the prosecutor asked the sentencing judge to make a DNA order under s. 487.051(3) under the Criminal Code.

Accused found not guilty; the accused could not have obtained a licence to drive an ATV on the highway because it is a prohibited vehicle. Before one can be found guilty of this offence, it must be proven that they were driving a motor vehicle of a type or class for which they could have been properly licenced to drive on a highway.","The accused was observed by police officers driving his all terrain vehicle (ATV) along highway #3 in the community of Woods Harbour, Nova Scotia. His driver's license was revoked and he was charged with driving a motor vehicle on the highway while his licence was revoked, contrary to s.287(2) of the Motor Vehicle Act. The defence argued that the words'motor vehicle' do not include an ATV and that even if those words did, the accused should be found not guilty because his license revocation was irrelevant since he could never have been licensed to drive the ATV. The Crown argued that because the accused was driving a vehicle on highway and his 'driver's license' was revoked he was guilty of the offence. At trial, the Court held that it was not that simple, but the defence was clearly not exempting ATV's from the definition of motor vehicles in all provisions of the motor vehicle Act. They were words used in s. 11 of the Act which permits the use of an all-terrain vehicle on public highways, although they are not operated simply by muscular power, as the Crown was still prevented from registering such a vehicle. The accused was charged under s. 230(1) with operating a highway without insurance and the offence of driving a prohibited vehicle was still relevant since he was not charged with the Crown's insurance. The Court also held that the accused could not have been charged with an offence of operating motor vehicle in the highway because he was a pedestrian and would be liable for any damages arising in the event of an accident. Since there was no nexus between his driving of the ATVs and the revocation of his driver’s license, he was found guilty of this offence."
c_2016skqb374.txt,"HELD: The appeal as to the convictions and the sentences imposed was dismissed. The court found with respect to each issue that the trial judge had not erred: 1) the defence had acknowledged the appellant had used force and that his spouse had not consented to it. Therefore the appellant could not argue on appeal that the trial judge failed to take implied consent into account. The trial judge was entitled to accept the spouse’s testimony as she was not cross-examined at trial. There was nothing in the transcript that showed the trial judge took a zero tolerance approach. The trial judge found that defence of de minimis was not open to the appellant based on her finding that the application of force by the appellant was more than trifling. On appeal, the court could not substitute its view of the evidence from that of the trial judge; 2) the trial judge found that the appellant intentionally drove in a manner that he knew created a danger for others and to frighten his spouse. She was entitled to conclude the appellant’s conduct was a marked departure from that expected of reasonably prudent driver. The evidence was reasonably capable of supporting her decision; and 3) the appellant had not identified how the trial judge had erred on any of the grounds an appeal court could consider. It was not open to it to intervene only because it would have weighed sentencing factors differently from the trial judge.","The accused was charged with five Criminal Code offences arising from incidents occurring on or about August 22, 2015 in Humboldt, Saskatchewan. The accused was acquitted of all other charges. The Court reviewed the evidence and found the accused guilty of dangerous driving, dangerous driving and assault. The trial judge focused on the fact that the accused overtook the complainant, pushed her toward the side of the road and deliberately cut her off. The complainant was not an overly cooperative witness and refused to repeat any conversation she had with the accused based on spousal privilege. HELD: The appeal was dismissed. The court found that the trial judge properly instructed herself on the law and that her findings of fact are supported by the evidence. There was nothing in the transcript which suggested she took a zero tolerance approach to domestic assault without consideration to the circumstances. The evidence showed that the incident occurred on a residential street and that, apart from two parked cars, no other vehicles, pedestrians or children were present at the time of the incident. As the complainant and her daughter were in her vehicle, the accused's driving presented some degree of danger to the appellant and she was unable to leave because the accused was aggressive, smelled of alcohol and did not consent to the application of force. While there may have been some misunderstanding or misunderstanding between the parties, the evidence was found to be reasonably capable of supporting the appellant's conclusion."

Since the tribunal procedure has not been completed, the portions of the statement of claim dealing with the human rights complaint are stayed on the basis that the underlying issues may only be heard by the court upon application of the Chief Commissioner of the Saskatchewan Human Rights Code pursuant to s. 29.6 of the Code. With respect to the claim that the defendant breached The Animal Protection Act, the essence of the claim is to seek damages against the plaintiff for the loss of the service dog. That portion of the claim must be struck because the plaintiffs cannot circumvent the provisions of The Animal Protection Act, 1999 nor eliminate the defendant’s right to be charged and tried in Provincial Court through the expediency of claiming a declaration in a civil suit. The third claim is that the defendant was negligent in allowing other children to interact with the service dog will not be struck because, assuming the facts in the pleadings are true, the claim for damages is viable. Likewise, the fourth claim that the defendant intentionally inflicted mental and emotional suffering on the autistic plaintiff will not be struck as is not plain and obvious from the pleadings that the claim cannot succeed. The plaintiffs’ application for an interlocutory injunction was dismissed because the claims that have not been struck are not rationally connected to the injunction, even assuming the remaining claims present a serious issue to be tried they do not justify a finding that the plaintiffs will suffer irreparable harm if the injunction is refused and the balance of convenience weighs in favour of not granting an injunction.","The plaintiffs are the five children of the Lawless family who reside near Maryfield, Saskatchewan. They attended a French language school (École de Bellegarde) for the benefit of their children. In February 2013, the school administration informed the family that the children's provisional permission to attend would not be extended for the 2013-2014 school year. The Lawless children filed a complaint with the Saskatchewan Human Rights Commission (SHRC) alleging that the school had discriminated against them because they had a service dog. The CÉF applied to strike the plaintiffs' statement of claim as an abuse of process because the plaintiffs never applied for judicial review to set aside the appeal decision rendered by the elected directors of the school and their failure to encourage learning of the French language in partnership with the school. HELD: The Court held that s. 23 of the Charter gives it an exclusive and unfettered authority to decide whether it will admit any non-rights holders to attend a fransaskois school in Saskatchewan, and neither this Court nor the SHRC may inquire into its reasons or interfere with its exercise of its discretion.  1) The Court found that the plaintiffs had failed to live up to their commitments made to them in return for their assistance in helping to facilitate the integration of the children with a guide dog. 2) It was impossible for the plaintiffs to demonstrate that they had not made significant contributions to the community by ignoring and ignoring their commitments. 3) There was no evidence to support the claim on the basis of which the Court could have concluded that the statements of claim were not viable. The Court rejected the plaintiffs’ application for an interlocutory injunction."
4_2000canlii2523.txt,"The applicant, having received a tentative subdivision approval, applied for final approval. In the meantime, the Municipality's road construction specifications had become more stringent and his proposal did not comply with the new specifications. The development officer found the application to be incomplete and the applicant applied for certiorari and mandamus. Certiorari granted; declaration issued that application for final subdivision approval was complete; order for mandamus granted and the development officer directed to issue final approval (subject only to the applicant correcting the technical error in the plan). The development officer's decision was based on interpretation of relevant legislation and the proper standard of review is correctness. The development officer misinterpreted the legislation. Since the applicant had already received tentative approval under the old regime, it did not have to meet the new higher standards for final approval. There was not another legal remedy open to the applicant equally convenient, beneficial and appropriate. The right of appeal under the legislation existed only from a refusal by a development officer and technically, this was not a refusal as the application was found incomplete. Both the right of appeal under the Act and the Board's power to grant an appeal were limited, either of which could result in the applicant having no remedy","Land developer applied for and failed to receive final subdivision approval. The applicant applied for tentative subdivision approval in 1997 and received the same in 1998. Shortly thereafter, the Municipality passed a new subdivision by-law requiring higher road standards. After several initial attempts, the application was determined by the development officer to be incomplete for essentially two reasons: 1) it failed to meet the newly incorporated road standards; and 2) one of the bearings on the plan was missing. The Municipality relied upon s. 278 of the Municipal Government Act in finding the application incomplete. This decision was set aside.Land developer takes issue with development officer's decision to declare application incomplete and looks to this Court for relief. Land developer appeals refusal to grant a final subdivision permit. HELD: The applicant is entitled to a declaration that the application is complete and to a relief order. 1) It is significant that the right of appeal is from a refusal. This is significant in light of s. 277 of the Act. Section 283 represents the legislator's effort to protect developers exactly like the Applicant who received tentative approval under one regime and are to be protected from any subsequent changes. The development officer erred in law in finding it incomplete. 2) On the same basis, the Applicant attests to the decision of the developer to declare the application complete, (again subject to non-contentious error in the plan) for a period of one hundred and fifty days from the publication of the first notice advertising the council's intention to adopt or amend the subdivision by law."
1995canlii4465.txt,"The plaintiffs statement of claim was served on the defendant in Ontario two days after it was issued. Two weeks later the prothonotary issued default judgment for $8,000, plus $2,880 in interest and $404.42 in costs. The defendant applied, pursuant to Civil Procedure Rule 12.06, to set aside the default judgment, on the ground that the plaintiff did not meet the requirements for obtaining a default judgment from the prothonotary or, in the alternative, on the merits that it had, by affidavit evidence, raised triable issues and provided a reasonable excuse for its failure to file a defence. Dismissing the application with costs of $1,000 to the plaintiff, that although the plaintiff ought to have sought the court's leave to take default judgment such a procedural ommission did not, in the circumstances, prejudice the defendant. Further, while there were triable issues between the parties, the defendant's failure to file a defence was neither a mistake nor an oversight, but rather a deliberate decision so as not to attorn to Nova Scotia jurisdiction, and therefore was not a reasonable excuse.","The plaintiff corporation was amalgamated with the defendant corporation and held itself out as an energy efficiency consultant. The defendant entered into a letter agreement whereby the defendant agreed to pay 50% of the energy savings enjoyed for a period of sixty months, provided such savings were the result of whatever of the defendant's recommendations were approved by and implemented by the plaintiff. The plaintiff opposed the agreement and brought a motion to stay the action on the basis of forum non conveniens. At issue was whether the default judgment met the requirements set out in the Civil Procedure Rule 12.06, the jurisdiction of the Nova Scotia court, and whether it was subject to the jurisdiction set aside by the court. Dismissing the application, that the defendant had not failed to establish any reasonable excuse for its failure to file a defence. In fact, the Court found that failure to act within the meaning of the Rule could not be considered as a reasonable excuse."
5_2001skqb98.txt,"Issues of divorce, custody and access were disposed of by judgment given during the course of the trial by consent of the parties. Matrimonial property was to be divided, maintenance for the children and spousal support were to be determined. HELD: 1)Access was to be mutually agreed upon with the 18 year old to whom the respondent stood in loco parentis.  2)Expert evidence of tax implications was not called as the respondent failed to give notice as required by the Rules of Court. 3)The mother's annual income for purposes of the Guidelines was fixed at $11,376 not including the $300 child support she received from the natural father of the 18 year old. The respondent's farming income was determined on a 3 year average as it varied from year to year. The facts justified adding back 25% of the capital cost allowance on the machinery over the last 3 years for Guideline purposes. Day care and play school costs of $440 per month were to be divided according to their proportionate share based on the Guidelines. The respondent was to pay one-half of the cost of extra curricular activities and any future activities as agreed upon. The approach used in Cook v. Kilduff was adopted and the amount for the two natural children was deducted from the amount payable for three children. One-half of the difference was added to the Guideline amount of support for the two children. 4)Spousal support was not ordered. The mother was employed and the respondent's income was not likely to increase in the near future. Given he paid child support and the extra costs, their income was nearly the same. 5)Of the six quarter sections owned by the respondent prior to marriage, there was no equity in one and the increase in value in the others was marginal. Credit was given for the reduction in the mortgage debt by $24,000. There was no interest to be divided in the 1999 crops. 6)The petitioner was awarded judgment for $113,155.19 less $15,580 for assets in her possession and less one-half the appraisal costs. The judgment was to be a charge on the respondent's land. The petitioner may apply for judgment for the amount of the loan secured by the van in her possession if the respondent fails to pay off the loan. 7)Each was to pay his or her own costs.","The issue of divorce, custody and access was disposed of by judgments given during the course of the trial by consent of the parties. The issue of access was mutually agreed to between the respondent and the child who was now 18 years of age. HELD: 1) The petitioner is presently employed and the respondent's income is unlikely to increase in the near future. Given the fact that after the respondent pays child support he will be nearly the same, the Court declines to order any spousal support. 2) The respondent stands in loco parentis in respect of the child. He receives the sum of $300 per month from the natural father of Randy. The court order for Randy predated the Guidelines and therefore the petitioner pays income tax on that amount. The one-half of this difference is to be taken and added to the Guideline amount of support for the two children to obtain the total payable for the three children. The total value of the matrimonial property assets set forth on Exhibit P-6 is $15,580. 3) The Court is of the view that capital cost allowance taken on machinery should generally not be added back for purposes of determining the income of the respondent for the purpose of the Guidelines. A mortgage debt of $24,000 was paid off by the respondent in the amount of $2,200 to the petitioner, less one half the costs of the appraisals. 4) There are no costs awarded to either party and each must pay his or her own costs. 5) In the event that the respondent failed to pay the loan secured by the van now in the possession of the petitioner the Court will order judgment against him in their respective percentage based on the Guidelines for the amount remaining unpaid. The respondent is to pay half of the cost of extra-curricular activities as set out on Exhibits P-9, P-10 and P-ll and the Wheat Board Board Payments 20,750. 1) There is no evidence as to the value of standing crops. Twenty-five percent of $37,971.00 equals $9,492.96. Therefore the Court is satisfied there is no interest to claim in standing crops for 1999."
4_2005skqb542.txt,"The Government seeks an order pursuant to Rule 164(4) of the Queen's Bench Rules requiring the plaintiff to provide better particulars in response to its demand for particulars and pursuant to Rule 173 of the Rules and order striking portions of the pleadings. HELD: 1) The plaintiff has failed to identify the legislative scheme by which responsibility for education in Ile a la Crosse or specifically, responsibility for education of a group of people that included the plaintiff, was delegated to the Minister of Education or any other member of executive government. The Government is entitled to know the case it has to meet. If the plaintiff knows the statute and regulations on which he relies, he must provide particulars. If he does not have particulars of the statutes and regulations, he must so state. 2) The court was not prepared to strike the phrases 'without limiting the generality of the foregoing' and 'without limitation'. The conduct of examination for discovery and undertakings can provide the defendant with particulars of allegations to be made by the plaintiff in order to permit it to properly defend the action.  3) The Government demanded full particulars of the breach of trust and breach of fiduciary duty. The plaintiff's response does not lay a foundation for either and the paragraphs are struck.  4) The court was satisfied that exemplary damages and punitive damages were synonymous and therefore only one of them should be pled to avoid confusion. The court directed that any reference to exemplary damages should be read as to include punitive damages and that only one phrase should be used. 5) As the cause of action clearly predates the coming into force of The Pre-judgment Interest Act, the provisions of that Act have no application to the plaintiff's claim.","The Government of Saskatchewan sought an order pursuant to Rule 164(4) of the Queen's Bench Rules requiring the defendant to provide better particulars in response to its demand for particulars and in default of so doing striking the offending portions of the statement of claim. The plaintiff cites samples of cases involving similar open ended phrases and submits that such wording is common and should be permitted by the courts. HELD: In the circumstances, the court was not prepared to strike the phrases complained of. The conduct of examinations for discovery and undertakings can provide the defendant with particulars of allegations to be made by the plaintiff in order to permit it to properly defend the action. The pleadings support a claim for damages for breach of trust and breach of fiduciary duty.  1) The Government is entitled to know the case it has to meet. If the plaintiff knows the statutes and regulations on which he relies, he must provide particulars of same. If he does not have particulars the court must so state. 2) It is essential for the plaintiff to provide particulars to the defendant in order for the administration of justice and for the benefit of the administration. The administration may rely on the Public Officers' Protection Act (POPA). 3) On the issue of open-ended pleadings, the government relies on R.E.L. v. J.G.S. (2000), 191 Sask. R. 204 (Sask. Q.B.) but if there is a chance that the plaintiff might succeed, then the plaintiff should not be driven from the judgment seat. 4) The trial judge will have to consider whether the pleadings fulfill the requirements of Rule 173 of The Pre-judgment Interest Act or the Rule 173 standard for striking out claim or portions thereof under Rule 173. The court reviewed the cases and found there was no foundation for the claim based on the vague nature of the issues, the absence of particulars of statutory provisions, the emphasis on disloyalty and promotion of one's own or others' interests at the expense of the beneficiary's interests. The fact that the applicant must know the statutory scheme by which responsibility for education in Ile a la Crosse or specifically, responsibility for the education of a group of people that included the plaintiff, was redundant. The evidence is conclusive that the claim was founded within the knowledge and peruse[sic] of the Defendant and the defendant knew or ought to have known it would suffer damages if it failed to carry out its duty. The claim is dismissed."
