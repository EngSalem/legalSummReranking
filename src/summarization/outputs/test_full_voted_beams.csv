b_2017skqb81.txt,"HELD: The issues were determined as follows: 1) the applicant applied pursuant to The Seizure of Criminal Property Act, 2009, as that version of the Act was in place at the time of the seizure. The respondent argued that s. 35.1 did not apply at the time of seizure, because it was not in the Act at the time of seizure. The respondent argued that the two-year limitation period pursuant to The Limitations Act applied to the application with the date of seizure being the date of discoverability. The respondent also argued that the 2009 Act did not have retrospective application. The court found that the applicant applied pursuant to the 2009 Act and therefore the matter was assessed from that perspective. Section 35.1 of the 2009 Act required applications for forfeiture to be made within two years from the director becoming satisfied that the property sought to be forfeited was proceeds of unlawful activity or an instrument of unlawful activity. The court found that the words “Notwithstanding The Limitations Act” at the beginning of s. 35.1 served to provide an intention to prioritize the content of s. 35.1 over The Limitations Act. An affidavit filed by the applicant indicated that the director became satisfied that the property was an instrument of unlawful activity after August 2016. The director’s application was brought four months later, well within the two-year limitation period. The court then considered whether the 2009 Act had retrospective application and found that B. had the same legal position and faced the same jeopardy regardless of the version of the legislation, and therefore, there was no retrospective problem;  2) s. 7 outlined the test to apply. The court accepted the expert’s evidence with regards to the significance of the factors evidencing drug trafficking and how common they were to the drug trafficking trade. The applicant’s evidence also showed that the person alleging to purchase the truck from the respondent was not the purchaser and the purchase price was $8,000, not $16,000. The court found it more likely than not that the money was proceeds of unlawful activity; and 3) B. did not provide evidence or argument to support the exception that forfeiture would clearly not be in the interests of justice. The property was found to be proceeds of unlawful activity and the forfeiture order was granted.","This is an application by the Director under the The Seizure of Criminal Property Act for an order directing the forfeiture of $10,475.00 to the Crown in right of Saskatchewan.

Since Mr. Butler filed notice of dispute in response to those proceedings, the Director applied to this Court for a forfeiture order pursuant to Part II of the 2009 Act. HELD: The application was granted. 1)There is no retroactivity problem. The reality is that the Director commenced proceedings under the 2009 act thus the Director's authority to pursue a forfeiture application must be assessed from that perspective alone. 2)The terms 'property' and 'proceeds of unlawful activity' were defined in s. 8 of the 2010 Act.

The date of charges is irrelevant as is the need for a finding of criminal culpability. 3)The evidence on when the Director 'became satisfied' the seized property constituted proceeds of unlawful activities was found in the Affidavit of Tammy Pryznyk sworn December 15, 2016.

Section 35.1 of the 2009 Act required applications for forfeiture to be made within two years from the director becoming satisfied that the property sought to be forfeited was proceeds of unlawful activity or an instrument of unlawful activity. The court found that the words “Notwithstanding The Limitations Act” at the beginning of s. 35.1 served to provide an intention to prioritize the content of s. 35.1 over The Limitations Act. An affidavit filed by the applicant indicated that the director became satisfied that the property was an instrument of unlawful activity after August 2016. The director’s application was brought four months later, well within the two-year limitation period. The court then considered whether the 2009 Act had retrospective application and found that B. had the same legal position and faced the same jeopardy regardless of the version of the legislation, and therefore, there was no retrospective problem;  2) s. 7 outlined the test to apply. The court accepted the expert’s evidence with regards to the significance of the factors evidencing drug trafficking and how common they were to the drug trafficking trade. The applicant’s evidence also showed that the person alleging to purchase the truck from the respondent was not the purchaser and the purchase price was $8,000, not $16,000. The court found it more likely than not that the money was proceeds of unlawful activity; and 3) B. did not provide evidence or argument to support the exception that forfeiture would clearly not be in the interests of justice.

He now applies to reduce his support obligation and rescind the arrears which have accumulated. HELD: 1) In 1999, the respondent sold his ownership interest in a business and retained a one-third interest. In 2001, he was terminated from his full-time employment as a result of an unexplained absence from work after he received a suspension for insubordination. Since his termination, he has not obtained full-time employment. He has continued to work seasonally 3 months a year and earn the gross amount of $21,000. The Court found that it is the respondent's choice to work a minimum amount each year. It has been said that individuals, who are subject to support obligations, are entitled to make decisions in relation to their careers as long as the decisions are reasonable at the time having regard to the circumstances. The respondent's decision to work only three months a year and to possibly return to school is not reasonable. 2) For the purposes of this application, the respondent's income was imputed to be $40,000 and he was ordered to pay $328 per month as support for his daughter. 3) The sharing of the s. 7 special expenses should be based on the respondent's imputed income. 4) A retroactive variation of child support is warranted. The respondent commenced his application for variation in June 2002 and the chambers judge was of the view that any variation of support should be retroactive to September 2002.  In light of the fact the respondent's previous support obligation was tax deductible/tax inclusive, the petitioner may in fact benefit from a retroactive variation as the child support she will receive, pursuant to this order, will be payable on a net of tax basis.  5) Rule 608(2) provides that a successful party will be entitled to costs of a family law proceeding unless, pursuant to Rule 608(3), the successful party has behaved unreasonably or has acted in bad faith. The difficulty in the matter before me is determining whether or not the respondent has been successful. Although his support obligation decreases, his previous payment was tax deductible while his ongoing payment will be net of tax. It is very likely that the respondent's financial position has not changed as a result of the order. The Court also had grave concerns respecting the substantial delays in the proceedings caused by the respondent's unwillingness to provide financial disclosure. Costs were awarded to the petitioner in the sum of $750, as the discovery motion would not have been necessary had the respondent provided appropriate financial disclosure.","FIAT: The father was ordered to pay child support of $600 per month.

Since his termination, he has not obtained full-time employment. He has continued to work seasonally 3 months a year and earn the gross amount of $21,000.

She alleged that she instructed the Town Office to shut off her water supply and the failure to do so led to the damages being sustained. The Town of Martensville disputes that such instructions were given and that specific forms are now utilized for disconnect purposes. HELD: The action was dismissed. 1)The plaintiff's action cannot succeed for the following reasons: a)The Court cannot find on the evidence that clear instructions are given to the town to disconnect the water service. To the contrary, the form executed by the plaintiff clearly indicates request for final billing. The evidence demonstrates a misunderstanding at best between what the plaintiff believed she was requesting and what in fact she did instruct. This however cannot be construed as negligence in the circumstances by the town nor does the fact that specific form are now being utilized for the disconnect purposes, which would be difficult to negotiate with her daughter.  2)No order was made as to costs."
6_2009skqb394.txt,"The plaintiff bought a house. She used the services of Cecilia Mui, a realtor associated with the defendant 100% Realty Associates Ltd. operating as Re/max Saskatoon. The house was purchased from the defendants Edward and Verl Karpinski. The vendors' realtor was the defendant, Mario Jacobucci, owner of the defendant Trevi Holdings Ltd. The house did not meet the plaintiff's expectations. She now sues the defendants seeking recovery of damages for alleged latent defects. She claims Ms. Mui fell below the standard of care required of a realtor representing a purchaser. She claims Ms. Mui was negligent in misrepresenting certain facts and breached the fiduciary duty expected of her. The plaintiff claims the Karpinskis misrepresented facts to her, negligently and fraudulently. The plaintiff claims that Mr. Jacobucci and his company are liable to her in damages, both in negligence and as parties to the misrepresentations made by the vendors. Special and general damages are claimed as are aggravated damages and punitive damages. The trial took place over 22 days, spanning several years and included testimony from 14 witnesses. Two main issues are raised. The first is the liability of each of the defendants. The second issue is quantum of damages. The credibility of the parties is at the forefront of the determination of the issues. HELD: The vendors are liable to the plaintiff for breach of contract. Each of the defendants is a tortfeasor, each having breached an obligation or duty owed to the plaintiff, whether through negligence or misrepresentation. Their wrongful acts and omissions all contributed to the same damage. In that respect their liability is concurrent. The liability of the vendors and Mr. Jacobucci is joint, and that of Ms. Mui is several. As concurrent torfeasors, the fault for the damage shall be apportioned equally among the four of them.  1) Credibility is not a science, see R. v. Gagnon, 2006 SCC 17. It is not always possible to articulate with precision the complex intermingling of impressions that emerge after watching and listening to witnesses and attempting to reconcile the various versions of events. The principles and tools to be used in assessing credibility are summarized in Novak Estate (Re), 2008 NSSC 283. 2) Certain of the evidence of the Karpinskis and Ms. Mui is so unreliable that the whole of their evidence is cast with doubt. 3) The opinions and conclusions of Mr. Loraas and Mr. Epp are accepted by the court. They are professionals with no interest in the outcome of the action. Their evidence was largely unchallenged. The Court finds that the pine shakes were rotten, sealant had been applied to the shakes on at least two occasions and prior to the plaintiff offering to buy the property, the shakes were not properly installed allowing water to seep into the house, the skylight leaked and caulking had been applied to stop the leaking before the plaintiff offered to buy the house, there was improper and inadequate venting which resulted in moisture damage to the interior of the house and mold in the attic, the moisture damage in the house included damage to drywall and paint blisters. Nail pops throughout the house were largely the result of the house being moved. No inspection was done after the house was moved. 4) The Court finds the Karpinskis did not speak truthfully or completely when they answered the questions in the Property Condition Disclosure Statement (PCDS). The Court does not accept that the vendors were not aware of water and moisture damage arising from the improperly installed shingles, the missing ridge caps, the leaking skylight or the lack of venting. The sealant on the roof was sufficiently old to predate the plaintiff's purchase of the house. The vendors repaired the sink holes and moisture pockets and effectively concealed the problems. It should have been disclosed. Although the vendors denied knowing of the structural damage to their house, they knew the house had been cut in half and moved 300 kilometers and had sustained damage. The structural problems were concealed by the vendors through repairs to the dry wall, reinforcement at stress points, and repainting and patching of wall paper. The fact that the house had been cut in half and moved should have been disclosed on the PCDS. 5) It is not only current defects or ongoing problems that need to be disclosed on a PCDS. A prospective purchaser does not look to the PCDS only to ascertain that the roof is not leaking on the day it was signed, see Kaufmann v. Gibson, [2007] O.J. No. 2711 (Ont. S.C.) (QL). The Karpinskis are liable to the plaintiff for breach of contract for failing to disclose the existence of structural defects, damage due to water and roof leakage. The terms of the PCDS formed part of the agreement between the parties and the deliberate withholding of this information amounted to a false representation as to the condition of the home. With respect to damage arising from these defects, the doctrine of caveat emptor does not apply. 6) The requirements for negligent misrepresentation have been established by the plaintiff. The failure to disclose, or silence as to a known defect, amounts to an act of concealment of a material fact and has the same effect as an express misrepresentation and is sufficient to attract liability, Thomas v. Blackwell, 1999 SKQB 168. 7) The false representations knowingly made by the vendors and their silence as to material facts were fraudulent. 8) Ms. Mui was negligent and her conduct and advice to the plaintiff fell below the standard of care expected of a realtor acting for the purchaser of a rural property in 1999. She did not conduct any preliminary background checks with the Rural Municipality, which would include determining if proper permits had been obtained, prior to the plaintiff's offer to purchase. Ms. Mui did nothing more than merely mention a home inspection to the plaintiff on one occasion. At no time did she recommend a home inspection even after she knew the house had been moved and before the condition regarding a satisfactory PCDS was removed. Another reason to strongly recommend a home inspection would be in circumstances where the realtor knew that a rural municipality did not require building inspections and Ms. Mui knew this to be the case. The plaintiff relied on the representation of Ms. Mui to her detriment. Had Ms. Mui disclosed all material facts to the plaintiff and explained and recommended a home inspection, the Court is satisfied that the outcome for the plaintiff would have been different. Knowing the house had been moved and had not been inspected the plaintiff would have most likely reconsidered her decision to purchase. 9) The Court is satisfied that Mr. Jacabucci is liable to the plaintiff for negligent misrepresentation. He represented that the home was of 'quality construction'. This was incorrect. Mr. Jacobucci was also complicit in, and party to, the negligent misrepresentations made by the vendors in the PCDS. He knew the house had been moved and sustained damage. He also knew the skylight leaked. The plaintiff relied on these misrepresentations and damages resulted.  10) The costs incurred by the plaintiff to repair the house total $17,613. She is awarded $15,000 as compensation for personal time and effort that she expended in repairing the home. There is no evidence that the distress the plaintiff experienced constituted a physical injury, or a recognized psychiatric illness and she cannot be compensated for mental distress, whether under tort or breach of contract. She is awarded $10,000 for aggravated damages. Her claim for punitive damages is dismissed. Her claim for solicitor and client costs is dismissed. Corrigendum received dated December 3, 2009 and added to fulltext.","HELD: The plaintiff sues the defendants seeking recovery of damages for alleged latent defects in the house. She says that Ms. Mui and RE/MAX Saskatoon fell below the standard of care required of a realtor representing the purchaser of a residential property. She also says that the defendants, who remained parties to the action, were negligent in misrepresenting certain facts and breached the fiduciary duty expected of her. The plaintiff also claims aggravated damages against all defendants and punitive damages against Mr. and Mrs. Karpinski and Trevi Holdings Ltd., asserting that their acts and omissions exacerbated her distress. In the event that any defects existed, the defendants say that they were patent, and that the law of caveat emptor applies.  1) The plaintiff purchased a country home in 1998. It was owned by the defendants. Their realtor was the defendant, Mario Jacobucci, the owner of the last defendant, Trev Holdings Ltd. 2) The house did not meet the plaintiff’s expectations. She now sues them for recovery of the damages for latent defects. The realtor and company are liable to her in negligence and as party to the misrepresentations made by the plaintiff.  3) The court ordered the plaintiff to pay $250,000 for the house and $350,000 in general damages, including damages based upon mental and emotional distress, to all defendants.  4) The Court ordered the defendant to pay the sum of $1.5 million for the home.  5) The defendant was liable to the plaintiff in the amount of $400,000.  6) There was no discussion of home inspection.  7) The date of the sale was not set out in the Corrigendum.  8) In 1998, the plaintiff purchased the country home for $265,000 with possession date of August 6, 1999. The first of two offers was made in 1998, first with realtor not party to this action, and then later with Re/MAX. The second offer was for $285,000, open until June 20, 1999 at noon, and were accepted by the defendant the next morning.  9) The first offer was rejected by the realtor but the second one was made at the request of the plaintiff, who was a journeyman plumber.  10) In 1999 the plaintiff moved into her new home for the first time. She was captivated by the house, but knew that it was beyond her price range. The defendant misrepresented facts to her,","She says that Ms. Mui and RE/MAX Saskatoon fell below the standard of care required of a realtor representing the purchaser of a residential property. Mr. and Mrs. Karpinski, according to Ms. Schira, similarly misrepresented facts to her, negligently and fraudulently, both in information given to her which induced her, in part, to purchase the home, and in answers that they gave in a Property Condition Disclosure Statement (PCDS) which formed a condition of the contract for sale. 106) With the above in mind, I have determined that certain of the evidence of each of Mr. Karpinski, Mrs. Karpinski and Ms. Mui is so unreliable that the whole of their evidence is cast with doubt. I have, accordingly, accepted the observations of Mr. Loraas and the opinions of Mr. Epp. 123) In considering the liability of each of the defendants I have, as previously noted, accepted the conclusions and opinions of Mr. Loraas and Mr. Epp. In particular, I find:
(i) The pine shakes were rotting and many were cracked to such an extent that water could permeate the underlying joints and decking. 130) In this case, I have concluded that Mr. and Mrs. Karpinski did not speak “truthfully and completely” when answering all the questions in the PCDS. However, given their lack of veracity on key issues, I do not accept that they were unaware of other water and moisture damage, whether arising from the improperly installed shingles, the missing ridge caps, the leaking skylight or inadequate venting that was occurring elsewhere in the interior of the house. Accordingly I find Mr. and Mrs. Karpinski liable to Ms. Schira for breach of contract for failing to disclose in questions B, F and G of the PCDS the existence of structural defects, damage due to water, and roof leakage. The terms of the PCDS formed part of the agreement between the Karpinskis and Ms. Schira, and the deliberate withholding of this information amounted to a false representation as to the condition of the home. For reasons already set out, I would find that the false representations knowingly made by Mr. and Mrs. Karpinski, and their silence as to material facts, were fraudulent. I have concluded that Ms. Mui was negligent and that her conduct and advice to Ms. Schira fell below the standard of care expected of a realtor acting for the purchaser of a rural property in 1999. Further, had Ms. Mui fulfilled her obligation first to disclose all material facts to Ms. Schira, and second, to explain and, in these circumstances, recommend a home inspection, I am satisfied on a balance of probabilities that the outcome for Ms. Schira would have been different. 148) I am satisfied however that Mr. Jacobucci is liable to Ms. Schira for negligent misrepresentation. I award Ms. Schira $15,000 as compensation for the personal time and effort that she expended in repairing the house. However, there is no evidence that the distress that she experienced constituted a physical injury, or a recognized psychiatric illness. Conclusion 176) While Mr. and Mrs. Karpinski are liable for breach of contract, each of the defendants is a tortfeasor, each having breached an obligation or duty owed to Ms. Schira, whether through negligence or misrepresentation. 1. Ms. Schira shall have judgment against the defendants in the amount of $49,608.87. 2. Ms. Schira is entitled to pre-judgment interest under The Pre-Judgment Interest Act, S.S. 1984-85-86, c.

The realtor and company are liable to her in negligence and as party to the misrepresentations made by the plaintiff.  3) The court ordered the plaintiff to pay $250,000 for the house and $350,000 in general damages, including damages based upon mental and emotional distress, to all defendants.  4) The Court ordered the defendant to pay the sum of $1.5 million for the home.  5) The defendant was not a party to this action.  6) There was no discussion of home inspection at the time of the purchase of the property.  7) The date of the sale of the house was in the fall of 1998. In 1998, the plaintiff purchased the property for $299,000 with possession date of August 6, 1999. The following year, the property was listed for sale at $265,000.  8) The first time the plaintiff visited the property in 1998, she was at the address of the realtor, who was a friend of the defendant. The second time, in 1999, the defendant was at her house for approximately 7 months. She spent about an hour there and discovered that the house had been moved over 300 kilometres from its original building site. She did not know that the defendant had entered into a confidential agreement with her. She was not satisfied with the terms of the contract. The defendant and his company were liable to the plaintiff in damages, both in negligence, both","She says that Ms. Mui and RE/MAX Saskatoon fell below the standard of care required of a realtor representing the purchaser of a residential property. Mr. and Mrs. Karpinski, according to Ms. Schira, similarly misrepresented facts to her, negligently and fraudulently, both in information given to her which induced her, in part, to purchase the home, and in answers that they gave in a Property Condition Disclosure Statement (PCDS) which formed a condition of the contract for sale. 106) With the above in mind, I have determined that certain of the evidence of each of Mr. Karpinski, Mrs. Karpinski and Ms. Mui is so unreliable that the whole of their evidence is cast with doubt. I have, accordingly, accepted the observations of Mr. Loraas and the opinions of Mr. Epp. 123) In considering the liability of each of the defendants I have, as previously noted, accepted the conclusions and opinions of Mr. Loraas and Mr. Epp. In particular, I find:
(i) The pine shakes were rotting and many were cracked to such an extent that water could permeate the underlying joints and decking. 130) In this case, I have concluded that Mr. and Mrs. Karpinski did not speak “truthfully and completely” when answering all the questions in the PCDS. However, given their lack of veracity on key issues, I do not accept that they were unaware of other water and moisture damage, whether arising from the improperly installed shingles, the missing ridge caps, the leaking skylight or inadequate venting that was occurring elsewhere in the interior of the house. Accordingly I find Mr. and Mrs. Karpinski liable to Ms. Schira for breach of contract for failing to disclose in questions B, F and G of the PCDS the existence of structural defects, damage due to water, and roof leakage. The terms of the PCDS formed part of the agreement between the Karpinskis and Ms. Schira, and the deliberate withholding of this information amounted to a false representation as to the condition of the home. For reasons already set out, I would find that the false representations knowingly made by Mr. and Mrs. Karpinski, and their silence as to material facts, were fraudulent. I have concluded that Ms. Mui was negligent and that her conduct and advice to Ms. Schira fell below the standard of care expected of a realtor acting for the purchaser of a rural property in 1999. Further, had Ms. Mui fulfilled her obligation first to disclose all material facts to Ms. Schira, and second, to explain and, in these circumstances, recommend a home inspection, I am satisfied on a balance of probabilities that the outcome for Ms. Schira would have been different. 148) I am satisfied however that Mr. Jacobucci is liable to Ms. Schira for negligent misrepresentation. I award Ms. Schira $15,000 as compensation for the personal time and effort that she expended in repairing the house. However, there is no evidence that the distress that she experienced constituted a physical injury, or a recognized psychiatric illness. Conclusion 176) While Mr. and Mrs. Karpinski are liable for breach of contract, each of the defendants is a tortfeasor, each having breached an obligation or duty owed to Ms. Schira, whether through negligence or misrepresentation. 1. Ms. Schira shall have judgment against the defendants in the amount of $49,608.87. 2. Ms. Schira is entitled to pre-judgment interest under The Pre-Judgment Interest Act, S.S. 1984-85-86, c. P-22.2 calculated from February 8, 2000. 1. Ms. Schira shall have judgment against the defendants in the amount of $49,608.87.",0.43700787401574803,0.39064327485380124,"The plaintiff bought a house. She used the services of Cecilia Mui, a realtor associated with the defendant 100% Realty Associates Ltd. operating as Re/max Saskatoon. The house was purchased from the defendants Edward and Verl Karpinski. The vendors' realtor was the defendant, Mario Jacobucci, owner of the defendant Trevi Holdings Ltd. The house did not meet the plaintiff's expectations. She now sues the defendants seeking recovery of damages for alleged latent defects. She claims Ms. Mui fell below the standard of care required of a realtor representing a purchaser. She claims Ms. Mui was negligent in misrepresenting certain facts and breached the fiduciary duty expected of her. The plaintiff claims the Karpinskis misrepresented facts to her, negligently and fraudulently. The plaintiff claims that Mr. Jacobucci and his company are liable to her in damages, both in negligence and as parties to the misrepresentations made by the vendors. Special and general damages are claimed as are aggravated damages and punitive damages. The trial took place over 22 days, spanning several years and included testimony from 14 witnesses. Two main issues are raised. The first is the liability of each of the defendants. The second issue is quantum of damages. The credibility of the parties is at the forefront of the determination of the issues. HELD: The vendors are liable to the plaintiff for breach of contract. Each of the defendants is a tortfeasor, each having breached an obligation or duty owed to the plaintiff, whether through negligence or misrepresentation. Their wrongful acts and omissions all contributed to the same damage. In that respect their liability is concurrent. The liability of the vendors and Mr. Jacobucci is joint, and that of Ms. Mui is several. As concurrent torfeasors, the fault for the damage shall be apportioned equally among the four of them.  1) Credibility is not a science, see R. v. Gagnon, 2006 SCC 17. It is not always possible to articulate with precision the complex intermingling of impressions that emerge after watching and listening to witnesses and attempting to reconcile the various versions of events. The principles and tools to be used in assessing credibility are summarized in Novak Estate (Re), 2008 NSSC 283. 2) Certain of the evidence of the Karpinskis and Ms. Mui is so unreliable that the whole of their evidence is cast with doubt. 3) The opinions and conclusions of Mr. Loraas and Mr. Epp are accepted by the court. They are professionals with no interest in the outcome of the action. Their evidence was largely unchallenged. The Court finds that the pine shakes were rotten, sealant had been applied to the shakes on at least two occasions and prior to the plaintiff offering to buy the property, the shakes were not properly installed allowing water to seep into the house, the skylight leaked and caulking had been applied to stop the leaking before the plaintiff offered to buy the house, there was improper and inadequate venting which resulted in moisture damage to the interior of the house and mold in the attic, the moisture damage in the house included damage to drywall and paint blisters. Nail pops throughout the house were largely the result of the house being moved. No inspection was done after the house was moved. 4) The Court finds the Karpinskis did not speak truthfully or completely when they answered the questions in the Property Condition Disclosure Statement (PCDS). The Court does not accept that the vendors were not aware of water and moisture damage arising from the improperly installed shingles, the missing ridge caps, the leaking skylight or the lack of venting. The sealant on the roof was sufficiently old to predate the plaintiff's purchase of the house. The vendors repaired the sink holes and moisture pockets and effectively concealed the problems. It should have been disclosed. Although the vendors denied knowing of the structural damage to their house, they knew the house had been cut in half and moved 300 kilometers and had sustained damage. The structural problems were concealed by the vendors through repairs to the dry wall, reinforcement at stress points, and repainting and patching of wall paper. The fact that the house had been cut in half and moved should have been disclosed on the PCDS. 5) It is not only current defects or ongoing problems that need to be disclosed on a PCDS. A prospective purchaser does not look to the PCDS only to ascertain that the roof is not leaking on the day it was signed, see Kaufmann v. Gibson, [2007] O.J. No. 2711 (Ont. S.C.) (QL). The Karpinskis are liable to the plaintiff for breach of contract for failing to disclose the existence of structural defects, damage due to water and roof leakage. The terms of the PCDS formed part of the agreement between the parties and the deliberate withholding of this information amounted to a false representation as to the condition of the home. With respect to damage arising from these defects, the doctrine of caveat emptor does not apply. 6) The requirements for negligent misrepresentation have been established by the plaintiff. The failure to disclose, or silence as to a known defect, amounts to an act of concealment of a material fact and has the same effect as an express misrepresentation and is sufficient to attract liability, Thomas v. Blackwell, 1999 SKQB 168. 7) The false representations knowingly made by the vendors and their silence as to material facts were fraudulent. 8) Ms. Mui was negligent and her conduct and advice to the plaintiff fell below the standard of care expected of a realtor acting for the purchaser of a rural property in 1999. She did not conduct any preliminary background checks with the Rural Municipality, which would include determining if proper permits had been obtained, prior to the plaintiff's offer to purchase. Ms. Mui did nothing more than merely mention a home inspection to the plaintiff on one occasion. At no time did she recommend a home inspection even after she knew the house had been moved and before the condition regarding a satisfactory PCDS was removed. Another reason to strongly recommend a home inspection would be in circumstances where the realtor knew that a rural municipality did not require building inspections and Ms. Mui knew this to be the case. The plaintiff relied on the representation of Ms. Mui to her detriment. Had Ms. Mui disclosed all material facts to the plaintiff and explained and recommended a home inspection, the Court is satisfied that the outcome for the plaintiff would have been different. Knowing the house had been moved and had not been inspected the plaintiff would have most likely reconsidered her decision to purchase. 9) The Court is satisfied that Mr. Jacabucci is liable to the plaintiff for negligent misrepresentation. He represented that the home was of 'quality construction'. This was incorrect. Mr. Jacobucci was also complicit in, and party to, the negligent misrepresentations made by the vendors in the PCDS. He knew the house had been moved and sustained damage. He also knew the skylight leaked. The plaintiff relied on these misrepresentations and damages resulted.  10) The costs incurred by the plaintiff to repair the house total $17,613. She is awarded $15,000 as compensation for personal time and effort that she expended in repairing the home. There is no evidence that the distress the plaintiff experienced constituted a physical injury, or a recognized psychiatric illness and she cannot be compensated for mental distress, whether under tort or breach of contract. She is awarded $10,000 for aggravated damages. Her claim for punitive damages is dismissed. Her claim for solicitor and client costs is dismissed.

She says that Ms. Mui and RE/MAX Saskatoon fell below the standard of care required of a realtor representing the purchaser of a residential property. She also says that the defendants, who remained parties to the action, were negligent in misrepresenting certain facts and breached the fiduciary duty expected of her. The plaintiff also claims aggravated damages against all defendants and punitive damages against Mr. and Mrs. Karpinski and Trevi Holdings Ltd., asserting that their acts and omissions exacerbated her distress. In the event that any defects existed, the defendants say that they were patent, and that the law of caveat emptor applies.  1) The plaintiff purchased a country home in 1998.

She did not know that the house had been moved to its present location.  10) The second time, in 1999, she went to the property with her husband, who was a journeyman plumber. He was there for less than 20 minutes.

Both parties made application to vary child support on the basis of changes (ups and downs) in the farming business. The respondent wife, who recently purchased a house, also applied for lump sum spousal support which claim had been disallowed by the Court of Appeal. Monthly spousal support terminated as wife now self-sufficient; child support increased due to increase in husband's income; lump sum payment of $8,000 awarded to wife to help pay her relocation expenses from move with husband given six months to pay lump sum, but monthly spousal support to continue until the $8,000 was paid in full. Applications to vary should not be entertained simply because of the usual ups and downs of the farming business; the court must strive to average out the individual's ability to pay in such circumstances in order to ensure stability of payments for both parties.

9_1994canlii4844.txt,"This decision is supplementary to [1993]TWL QB93506. Applications to further divide matrimonial property and to vary spousal maintenance. The husband had declared personal bankruptcy since the date of the original orders obtained under the Matrimonial Property Act and Divorce Act. HELD: 1)The husband's obligation to pay maintenance was reduced to $1 per month and the arrears accruing after the date of his assignment into bankruptcy were cancelled.  2)The wife's counsel requested that the court value and divide all of the matrimonial property equally notwithstanding the bankruptcy, because she might pursue a constructive trust claim for her 1/2 share as against the husband's trustee. 3)The court valued all of the matrimonial property and determined that 56% of this value should be paid to the wife, and only 44% to the husband, given amounts he had spent since the separation.  4)The court left unresolved the issue of which matrimonial assets might be exempt under the Bankruptcy Act and therefore available to the wife.","HELD: The division of matrimonial property was to be held at a later date. The husband did not pursue livestock operation on the farm for a number of reasons, one of which being the fact that he required surgery on his back making it impossible for him to physically do the work. As a result a hearing date was set for May 13 at which the husband was asked in accordance with my prior judgment to complete the division of the matrimonial property. The wife filed a motion seeking a variation of the spousal maintenance order made in November in light of his bankrupt financial situation and his inability to earn any income at this time. The petitioner did pay the respondent $2,300 by way of maintenance out of certain barley he sold privately. The respondent claims this was in violation of his original order prohibiting the sale of any assets of the marriage without consent of the other party or the Court. On the basis of the foregoing calculations, the wife was awarded 56% of the estimated asset value and the husband 44% of his net proceeds to the wife.","1994.

Defendant sentenced to fine of $25,000, from which the sum of $15,000 shall be paid to the Canadian Farmers' Disability Registry; defendant ordered to perform 160 hours of community service with respect to farm safety. The defendant was an individual and not a huge corporation, had been conscientious about safety issues prior to this incident and had endeavored to improve safety at his farm after the incident; the deceased had also failed in his responsibilities under the Act and was working with a significant blood alcohol content.","The defendant, who owned and operated a family dairy farm, pleaded guilty to an offence under the Occupational Health and Safety Act that he failed to take every precaution that is reasonable in the circumstances to ensure the health and safety of persons at the workplace. The defendant's guilty plea relates to the fact that on August 13, 2006, one of his employees, Gary Boake, died in a manure pit. He had been out all night at social event, had been drinking and had not slept. His blood alcohol concentration was significantly over the legal limit for operating any kind of vehicle. He made substantial changes to the farm since the tragedy of Boake's death, including building a new dairy barn. These plans were in the works before the tragedy but were informed by the tragedy. He was in no condition to be operating equipment, which he needed to do to remove manure to the manure pit, and placed himself at risk. Punishment should be mitigated by the defendant's lesser degree of culpability and not arranging for an alternative to using the pit. The evidence in Exhibit 1, containing diagrams and photographs of the farm, and the submissions of Mr. Yuill, indicate clearly that the defendant was conscientious about safety issues before August 13 2006 and had endeavored to address and improve safety at his farm since that time. His Blood Alcohol concentration was over the bar for operating a motor vehicle. His credit card balance was over $15,000. HELD: The defendant was sentenced to a total penalty of $25,000 plus 160 hours of community service. The Court accepted the submission that the penalty was a significant penalty for the defendant.

The Court will not set aside the order nisi for judicial sale on the basis that the application for leave was premature or that the statement of claim was not noted for default. However, the application for confirmation of the sale is premature as the property is to be listed for 6 months. There does not appear on the evidence to be a sale to be confirmed. The plaintiff is prepared to make an offer, but does not appear to have done so. The draft bill of costs submitted contains numerous items which occurred prior to the granting of leave and there is no order from the Court authorizing pre-leave costs, nor any evidence as to why the Court might consider pre-leave costs. On a renewed application for confirmation of judicial sale, it would be preferable to have evidence directly from the listing agent setting out the steps taken to market the property and detailing for the Court any offers received. There will be no costs awarded for this unsuccessful application.","FIAT: The plaintiff seeks an order confirming the order nisi for judicial sale pursuant to the Land Contracts (Actions) Act.

d_2009skqb517.txt,"Counsel for the plaintiffs brings two notices of motion seeking 1) the opportunity to cross-examine a deponent on her affidavit and 2) an order to compel one of defendants to supply pre-certification notices to all persons who may be eligible to participate in the class action that is contemplated. HELD: The motions are dismissed with no order as to costs.  1) One of defendants contends that 7 people alleged by the plaintiffs to be viable class members have already entered into a full and final settlement with the defendant. This defendant earlier sought to examine these individuals. The Justice of this action at that time did not allow the examination but instead made an order permitting the defendant to file affidavits on the issue. This is the source of the affidavit the plaintiff seeks cross-examination on. The order also allowed the plaintiffs to file reply affidavits, which they chose not to do. There is nothing in the original order that could be interpreted as saying that the plaintiffs could cross-examine on the affidavit. In the view of the Court, having chosen not to file reply affidavits pursuant to the original order, it is not reasonable for plaintiff's counsel to embark on a totally different approach several weeks after the deadline has passed. There is also some concern that the actual purpose of the proposed cross-examination would be more general and broad-ranging than a mere challenge to the defendant's assertion that the individuals at issue have already entered into full and final settlements with the defendant.  2) In its barest sense, plaintiffs' counsel requests that the defendant supply a plaintiff by way of sending pre-certification notices to its clients. The Court is aware of Lewis v. Shell, where an Ontario court ordered notice to potential class members. However, that case is not similar to this case. In the Lewis case, the Court was faced with concern over the defendant contacting individuals who might be potential class members for the purpose of obtaining early settlements. Moreover, the Ontario class actions legislation is less restrictive than Saskatchewan's. The section of the Class Action Act which may permit such an order refer to a 'class action,' not an 'action.' As this case is still in the pre-certification stage, it is not yet a class action within the meaning of the Act. Spavier v. Canada also indicates that pre-certification motions of this sort would rarely be successful in this jurisdiction.","The plaintiff brought a motion pursuant to s. 12 of The Class Actions Act for an order requiring the defendant to serve pre-certification notices to all persons who travelled with the plaintiff during the purposed class. The plaintiff brought two separate notices of motion. The first was for the plaintiff to produce a list of proposed class members who had been provided with a letter and related package by the defendant (relating to test of their premises for contamination). The second motion sought to have the defendant Red Seal to provide the plaintiff with list of names, addresses, telephone numbers and other information relevant to the proposed class. Red Seal opposed the certification application (i.e. the defendant did not file an affidavit as opposed to providing their own evidence). HELD: The application was dismissed. 1) The Court's inherent jurisdiction is to be exercised judicially and only when the relief sought cannot reasonable and realistically be obtained by the applications in some other lawful manner. 2) It is important to note that the usual practices and application of the common law regarding civil litigation apply. The practices and the implementation of The Rules of Court apply. This is still an 'action' and not a 'class action'. The plaintiff is entitled to file a response affidavit within three days of the filing of the motion. 3) The court is not prepared to broaden the scope of Ottenbreit J.’s decision to allow for examination of Ms. Moore. There is nothing in the Act that confers jurisdiction on the court to make orders prior to certification of the proceedings as a class action. The usual practices, the enforcement of the rules of court apply. 4) In the case of Sparvier, the court reviewed the words of s. 14 and s. 24 of our Act and the context of the preparation of the Moore affidavit. 5) Based on the plain wording of the judgment, the Court may make any order it considers appropriate respecting the conduct of class action to ensure fair and expeditious determination and, for that purpose, may impose such terms on the parties as it deems appropriate. 6) The application is currently scheduled to be heard during the week of January 25th 2010 before the Honourable Justice Keene.","Indeed Ottenbreit J. directed that the only thing the plaintiffs could do was to file a reply affidavit within three days. 17) In my view it is not reasonable for the MLG several weeks after the deadline for filing the reply affidavit to embark on a totally different approach (i.e. examining the affidavit as opposed to providing their own evidence). 18) It appears to me that the actual purpose of examining Ms. Moore is not to challenge her version of the circumstances leading up to the signing of the alleged settlement agreements by the Roussys, but rather a more general and broad ranging interrogation of Ms. Moore about other customers who may have booked through her office with Red Seal at the relevant time of this case. 19) Accordingly, based on the plain wording of Justice Ottenbreit J.’s judgment and the context of the preparation of the Moore affidavit; I must dismiss the application for examination on the Moore affidavit.

There is also some concern that the actual purpose of the proposed cross-examination would be more general and broad-ranging than a mere challenge to the defendant's assertion that the individuals at issue have already entered into full and final settlements with the defendant.  2) In its barest sense, plaintiffs' counsel requests that the defendant supply a plaintiff by way of sending pre-certification notices to its clients. The Court is aware of Lewis v. Shell, where an Ontario court ordered notice to potential class members. However, that case is not similar to this case. In the Lewis case, the Court was faced with concern over the defendant contacting individuals who might be potential class members for the purpose of obtaining early settlements. Moreover, the Ontario class actions legislation is less restrictive than Saskatchewan's. The section of the Class Action Act which may permit such an order refer to a 'class action,' not an 'action.'

Both parties have some health problems. Originally, the appellant was ordered to pay the respondent $300.00 in monthly spousal support for a period of 1 year. Given the appellant's health difficulties and the fact that he was nearing retirement, the trial judge noted that the respondent would do well to become self-sufficient as soon as possible.

The Chambers judge who reviewed the original order found that, during the year period the respondent was collecting spousal support, she had not engaged in any gainful employment. She had sold her house and used the proceeds to spend over 4 months living in Hawaii and Jamaica. She obtained probationary employment just after filing a notice of motion but lost the job before the hearing commenced. HELD: The appeal is allowed, the orders of the Chambers judge for spousal support and costs against the appellant are set aside. The Chambers judge imputed an income of $14,289 to the respondent on the basis that she was capable of working 30 hours per week at minimum wage. He did not indicate why he did not find her capable of full time employment. The Chambers judge made an error in calculating the income of the appellant. He also discounted the expenses borne by the appellant in relation the maintenance of their adult child, who was a full-time student.

9_2006skca114.txt,"This is an application for leave to appeal, and leave being granted, an appeal by the Crown from a sentence imposed against a young offender pursuant to the Youth Criminal Justice Act. The respondent pled guilty to a charge of robbery, an offence contrary to s. 344(b) of the Criminal Code. The respondent was sentenced to 90 days secure custody, 45 days community supervision, 1 year probation and a 10 year firearms prohibition. HELD: Appeal allowed orally. The sentence is set aside and a sentence of 12 months closed custody, 6 months community supervision, 1 year probation and a 10 year firearms prohibition was imposed in addition to the 90 days closed custody already served at the time of the appeal.  1) It was clear that the primary concern of the sentencing judge was that, in the wake of the Supreme Court of Canada decision in R. v. B.W.P.; R. v. B.V.N. 2006 SCC 27, a custodial sentence might not be open to him at all. It is the Court's view that the sentencing judge's conclusion that the decision in B.W.P. virtually ruled out custodial sentences for young persons under the Youth Criminal Justice Act was unwarranted. The gist of that decision is that under the Act the principle of general deterrence is not a factor to be taken into account and cannot be used to justify a sentence harsher than the circumstances of the offender and the offence would warrant. Nor is specific deterrence to be considered as a separate factor. 2) It is the Court's view that a long custodial sentence is necessary to accomplish the task of bringing the seriousness of the offence to the respondent's attention, and provide meaningful consequences to reinforce societal values without negatively affecting the respondent's likelihood of rehabilitation.","This was an application for leave to appeal and, leave being granted, an appeal by the Crown from a sentence imposed against a young offender pursuant to the Youth Criminal Justice Act, S.C. 2002, c.1.

HELD: Appeal allowed orally. 1)The sentence imposed was demonstrably unfit, failing to take into account the seriousness of the offence, the culpability of the offender, the criminal history and other circumstances of the respondent, and his need for psychological and substance abuse counseling and education. The Court dealt with the matter orally, after hearing argument, granting the Crown's application to appeal, and allowing the appeal to proceed.  2)The sentencing judge focused considerable attention on the decision of the Supreme Court of Canada in B.W.P., which he took to indicate that sentence of closed custody must be employed only rarely and in unusual circumstances. However, no reasons at all were offered for the short length of the sentence imposed, or how this related to the principles of sentencing set out in the Act.","Disposition: Appeal allowed (orally) Smith J.A. 1] This is an application for leave to appeal and, leave being granted, an appeal by the Crown from a sentence imposed against a young offender pursuant to the Youth Criminal Justice Act, S.C. 2002, c. 1.

The gist of that decision is that under the Act, the principle of general deterrence is not a factor to be taken into account and cannot be used to justify a sentence harsher than the circumstances of the offender and the offence would warrant. Nor is specific deterrence to be considered as a separate factor. It is our view that these principles dictated a long term custodial sentence in this case, to accomplish the task of bringing the seriousness of the offence to the respondent’s attention, and provide meaningful consequences to reinforce societal values without negatively affecting the respondent’s likelihood of rehabilitation.

Nor is specific deterrence to be considered as a separate factor.

In pre-sentence report he was considered high risk for reoffending.","[1] The Crown seeks leave appeal the sentence imposed on the respondent after a sentencing circle.

The sentence was imposed for robbery with threats of violence contrary to s.348(1)(b) and s.334(2) of the Criminal Code which were committed in March 2000 while the accused was on probation. The appellant and co-accused were convicted of breaking and entering a private residence. The accused took $25 from the premises and held the 68 year old victim while the co-accused went to look for a knife after threatening to cut off his fingers. The following day the two accused used threats of violence while robbing a pharmacy and a witness testified the accused yelled to the co-accused to kill the victims. The co-accused who was convicted of assault received 7 years in prison for the robbery concurrent with 5 years for the B &amp; E. The 23 year old aboriginal who had a Grade 3 education had a prior record of 42 criminal convictions including eight violent or weapons related offences. HELD: Leave was granted. The appeal was allowed. The sentence of 4 years in prison on each charge to be served concurrently took into account time served on remand and electronic monitoring. The sentence was demonstrably unfit and fell outside the range of sentences previously imposed. The sentencing judge relied solely on the principle of rehabilitation, essentially ignoring the other sentencing principles including the level of gravity, the principle of deterrence, the need to denounce such acts, the sentence imposed on the co-accused, and the need to protect the public. A sentencing circle was inappropriate given the level of violence, his risk to re-offend, his consistent ignoring or refusal to follow court orders, and the fact that a penitentiary term was called for in such circumstances.

1991canlii4370.txt,"The defendant lawyer was retained for the purpose of obtaining and disbursing mortgage funds. The plaintiffs, creditors of the defendant's client, sued the defendant for negligent misrepresentation, breach of trust and breach of undertaking. The defendant initially received three irrevocable letters of direction for payment of amounts owing on a construction project. When the project got into financial difficulty the defendant advised his client to seek separate counsel to deal with the creditors - suppliers. At a creditors meeting the defendant advised the creditors' counsel of the initial three letters of direction. The project was considered viable by the creditors and continued, with the defendant obtaining postponements of the three letters of direction. Further creditors' meetings were held, a Creditors' Committee struck, and subsequent letters of direction sent to the defendant by the client and certain creditors. The defendant, in acknowledging a subsequent letter of direction, made no mention of the earlier three letters, nor any explanation of 'all of the proceeds'. One member of the Committee was aware of the initial irrevocable letters of direction. On what was to be the final mortgage draw, the defendant requested and was refused a postponement of the initial three letters. With his client's consent, the defendant disbursed the funds, to pay off the initial three creditors, a mechanics' lien referred in one of the subsequent letters of direction, his legal fees and the balance as per a letter of direction received from two of three members of the Creditors' Committee. Dismissing the action, that (1) there was no negligent misrepresentation as the creditors had continued to advance supplies, not on the basis of the defendant's letter of acknowledgement, but because they considered the project viable. Further, certain other plaintiffs were not aware of the letter, and could not have relied on it. Other plaintiffs did not supply after the letter and therefore did not rely on it. The Court noted that on a balance of probabilities, the defendant's disbursement did not cause the demise of the project. At the time of the disbursement the project was still viable and the plaintiffs made their own decision to cease supplying and to lien the project;  (2) there was no breach of trust as the defendant had no fiduciary duty and had at no time acted for the plaintiffs;  and  (3) there was no breach of undertaking as the undertaking must be considered in all the circumstances, including knowledge of the plaintiffs, the other letters and meetings. The Court concluded that the member of the Creditors' Committee who was aware of the initial irrevocable letters had a duty to advise the other members. The documentation was clear that legal fees would be deducted and the Committee was also aware of the direction to pay the mechanics' lien.","The plaintiff was retained to act as general counsel to and to the project. The plaintiff received a number of irrevocable letters of direction from the defendant in the amount of $154,000 when in fact some $300,000 had been expected. In early April of 1987, the first mortgagee of the project had become dissatisfied with the handling of project funds by one of the principals of and was withdrawing its support. In mid-1987, the second mortgagee, the Crowne Plaza developer, indicated willingness to inject more money into the project but that the creditors and suppliers were withdrawing support. At the time of the March 1987 meeting, the project was financially tight from the very beginning and cash flow was continuously problem. The plaintiffs alleged negligent misrepresentation and in the alternative, breach of trust on the part of the defendant. Any claim under this ground is therefore dismissed.","The plaintiffs have also raised an allegation of breach of trust on the part of Mr. Brookes; however, there is no evidence Mr. Brookes was ever in a fiduciary relationship with the plaintiffs, nor was he ever retained by the plaintiffs or purport in any way to act for them or on their behalf. In my respectful opinion the plaintiffs have not established the basis for a claim under breach of trust and cannot succeed on this ground. Firstly, I am not persuaded that the creditors continued to advance supplies to the project on the basis of Mr. Brookes\' letter of March 11, 1987 and, on a balance of probabilities, I find that the suppliers continued advancing to the project because they concluded that the project was still viable. Therefore, on this basis there can be no reliance by these latter creditors and it is impossible to see how they could have a claim for breach of an undertaking which is not communicated or directed to them before they provided their services or materials. In my respectful opinion, in the case at bar, one cannot interpret Mr. Brookes\' letter of March 11, 1987 in the abstract or in a vacuum and one must consider all of the surrounding circumstances, including the knowledge of the plaintiffs, through the Creditors\'Committee and their representatives, the letters of March 12, March 13 and March 16, 1987 and the various meetings resulting in those letters. Decision On the basis of the findings and conclusion reached, I therefore dismiss all the claims of the plaintiffs against the defendant, with costs.",0.4192771084337349,0.30894308943089427,"The defendant lawyer was retained for the purpose of obtaining and disbursing mortgage funds.

Dismissing the action, that (1) there was no negligent misrepresentation as the creditors had continued to advance supplies, not on the basis of the defendant's letter of acknowledgement, but because they considered the project viable. Further, certain other plaintiffs were not aware of the letter, and could not have relied on it. Other plaintiffs did not supply after the letter and therefore did not rely on it. The Court noted that on a balance of probabilities, the defendant's disbursement did not cause the demise of the project. At the time of the disbursement the project was still viable and the plaintiffs made their own decision to cease supplying and to lien the project;  (2) there was no breach of trust as the defendant had no fiduciary duty and had at no time acted for the plaintiffs;  and  (3) there was no breach of undertaking as the undertaking must be considered in all the circumstances, including knowledge of the plaintiffs, the other letters and meetings. The Court concluded that the member of the Creditors' Committee who was aware of the initial irrevocable letters had a duty to advise the other members.

In early April of 1987, the first mortgagee, which the plaintiff indicated would inject more money into the project, became dissatisfied with the handling of the project funds by one of the principals of and was withdrawing its support. In mid-1987, the defendant received a letter of direction requiring the plaintiff to pay mortgage brokerage and architectural fees from the mortgagees. In late 1986, the initial second mortgagee to the property became dissatisfied and the project at this time had a cash flow problem. The defendant recommended that the plaintiff retain separate legal counsel to deal with the mortgagee problem and the subsequent mortgage draws, both of which were acknowledged by the plaintiff. The plaintiffs have alleged negligent misrepresentation and in the alternative, breach of trust. Any claim under this ground is therefore dismissed. HELD: The plaintiff's claim was dismissed. 1)There was no evidence that the defendant was ever in a fiduciary relationship with the plaintiffs, nor was he ever retained by the plaintiffs or purport in any way to act for them or on their behalf.  2)The plaintiffs have not established the basis for a claim under breach of the trust and cannot succeed on this ground. There are certain statements or allegations contained in the pleadings and made during the proceedings which could be construed as raising an accusation of deliberate wrongdoing on the part of the defendant.  3)There is no evidence the plaintiff was ever involved with the plaintiff's business or purporting to act in any manner to act on his behalf. 4)The plaintiff's claims have been separately argued with regard to negligent representation and breach of undertaking. In their respectful opinion, the plaintiffs' claim has not established a foundation on which to proceed. 5)Any claim under the ground is dismissed.","The plaintiffs have also raised an allegation of breach of trust on the part of Mr. Brookes; however, there is no evidence Mr. Brookes was ever in a fiduciary relationship with the plaintiffs, nor was he ever retained by the plaintiffs or purport in any way to act for them or on their behalf.

Therefore, on this basis there can be no reliance by these latter creditors and it is impossible to see how they could have a claim for breach of an undertaking which is not communicated or directed to them before they provided their services or materials. In my respectful opinion, in the case at bar, one cannot interpret Mr. Brookes\' letter of March 11, 1987 in the abstract or in a vacuum and one must consider all of the surrounding circumstances, including the knowledge of the plaintiffs, through the Creditors\'Committee and their representatives, the letters of March 12, March 13 and March 16, 1987 and the various meetings resulting in those letters.

The Gladue report was considered and the background of the accused was assessed as an enormous mitigating factor. The court found that this was not an appropriate case to make an order pursuant to s. 743.6 of the Code both because of the multiple Gladue factors and because it had addressed the principles of denunciation and deterrence in the global sentence.","The accused was originally charged with second degree murder with regard to the death of his cousin.

Having considered all of the purposes and principles of sentencing as outlined in ss. 718, 718.1 and 718.2 of the Criminal Code including the totality principle and the Gladue factors the Court has determined that a global sentence of 10 years is appropriate in this case to be served in a federal institution on the manslaughter conviction.

Conclusion [39] For all the reasons as outlined in this decision I have concluded that as to the manslaughter conviction a sentence of 10 years in a federal institution is an appropriate sentence in the circumstances of this specific case.

A one-year concurrent sentence was imposed for the conviction of prohibited possession of a firearm. The court gave him credit at the rate of 1:1.5 for his time on remand, resulting in a net global sentence of six years, five months to be served in a federal penitentiary. The Gladue report was considered and the background of the accused was assessed as an enormous mitigating factor. The court found that this was not an appropriate case to make an order pursuant to s. 743.6 of the Code both because of the multiple Gladue factors and because it had addressed the principles of denunciation and deterrence in the global sentence.","The accused was originally charged with second degree murder with regard to the death of his cousin. He pled guilty to possession of a firearm while prohibited from doing so. The Crown presented six victim impact statements of the siblings of the victim and four of his brothers; collectively marked as Exhibit P12. The accused was on mandatory firearm prohibition at the time of the offence. Notwithstanding that firearm prohibition he willingly accepted a firearm from niece to hunt rabbits and prairie chicken.

b_1999canlii12595.txt,"The applicant applies for amendment of the judgment dated March 19, 1999 as it relates to costs. At the end of trial, the applicant requested the Court to reserve on the matter of costs. The applicant intended to make a submission for award of solicitor and clients costs. Evidence was led at trial about insubstantial offers made directly between the parties. Further evidence now indicates that substantial offers were made through council although not led at trial. The applicant argues that solicitor and client costs of $70,000 should be awarded because the offer to settle of $250,000 is close to the total judgment award of $230,000 including party and party costs of $20,000. The respondent takes the position that the estate was willing to pay reasonable maintenance costs and the quantum of maintenance could have been summarily determined without the necessity of extensive discoveries and without a lengthy trial. The respondent submits the approach of a needs-based assessment was upheld by the judgment and is always the approach always taken on behalf of the estate. The respondent argues the real question is whether the parties were acting bona fide during their negotiations and the issue should not be determined on the basis of the closeness of the offers. HELD: Solicitor and Client Costs of $70,000 are not appropriate in this case. The applicant's conduct was not entirely pure. The applicant was made aware in a prior judgment that under The Dependants' Relief Act there is nothing to indicate that a person is entitled to part of an estate as a beneficiary but rather that a beneficiary is entitled to maintenance. In spite of this ruling the applicant continued to claim the whole of the estate and to pursue full disclosure of the financial worth of the estate. Solicitor and client costs are within the discretion of the court but such discretion is exercise only in rare and exceptional circumstances. The conduct of the respondent cannot be characterized as reprehensible, scandalous or outrageous. The respondent's unwillingness to make full financial disclosure did contribute to the increase of costs but is insufficient to merit full solicitor and client costs. The Court awards fixed costs to the applicant in the amount of $47,000 together with disbursements.","The applicant applies for an amendment of the judgment of March 19, 1999 insofar as it relates to costs. At the conclusion of trial, counsel requested that costs be reserved on the basis of Column IV, Schedule 1B of the Tariff of Costs of The Queen's Bench Rules. HELD: 1)The applicant intended to make a submission for award of solicitor and client costs of approximately $70,000. The respondent argued that the judgment in that particular requires amendment since there was no evidence before the Court at trial about substantive offers made by counsel for the parties.  2)The Court was faced with two equally untenable positions in determining the costs. The applicant argued the Court needed to know the full extent of the estate so as to properly determine the applicant's entitlement to the estate. This argument cannot be accepted. 3)The court was satisfied that should reconsider the matter of costs since the applicant had intended to claim the entire estate and to pursue full disclosure of the financial worth. In the circumstances, it was merely happenstance that the maintenance order was roughly equivalent to one-half of the Estate. The court was also satisfied that the position of the applicant on the issue of costs was always to claim that the whole estate should be transferred to satisfy Jade’s maintenance. The issue was whether the parties were acting bona fide during their negotiations and that the issue should not be determined based on the closeness of the offers.  4)In fixing an amount, the Court reviewed the principles in Nalder v. Hawkins (1833), Myl. K. 243; 39 E.R. 937 in Re Champ (1986), 1986 CanLII 3001 (SK QB), 47 Sask.

3_2002skca102.txt,"The accused applied for a stay of proceedings on the ground the Crown failed to provide adequate disclosure. In making disclosure, the Crown appended a copy of the respondent's criminal record to its affidavit. The defence then applied for a stay on the ground of perception of bias on the part of the Provincial Court judge because the respondent's criminal record was before her. The Crown appealed the order which prohibited the judge from continuing as trial judge in respect to the respondent's criminal charges of impaired driving, driving with blood alcohol levels exceeding .08, and dangerous driving. HELD: The appeal was allowed. The order for prohibition was quashed and the matter was remitted to the Provincial Court for trial. There is abundant authority that disclosure of an accused's criminal record to the court alone does not amount to an automatic disqualification of the court on the ground of apprehended bias, appearance of bias or other prejudice to the accused. The judgment in R. v. Peters is almost directly on point. The judge in this case said she had not read the record, she was not biased as a result of the information tendered at the pre-trial proceedings and the record was something she could put out of her mind as she did in all instances where she ruled evidence inadmissible. She was correct in these circumstances to dismiss the application for a stay and to decline to recluse herself.","This appeal is from an order by a Queen's Bench judge prohibiting McMurtry P.C.J. from continuing as trial judge in respect of criminal charges against the respondent. The respondent was charged with impaired driving, driving with a blood-alcohol level exceeding.08, dangerous driving and dangerous driving. He moved for stay of proceedings on the ground that the Crown had failed to provide adequate disclosure. The Crown filed an affidavit to show disclosure had been made. The affidavit had appended as exhibits the items disclosed, among them, copy of the criminal record of Mr. Herzberg. HELD: The appeal was allowed and the matter was remitted to the Provincial Court for trial. 1)Judges of facts, whether they be juries or judges sitting alone, have sworn duty to base their conclusions solely on the admissible evidence. There is abundant authority that disclosure of an accused's criminal record to the court, whether composed of judge and jury or jury alone, does not amount to an automatic disqualification of the court on the grounds of apprehended bias, appearance of bias or other prejudice to the accused. The judgment of Matheson J. in R. v. Peters (1991), 1991 CanLII 7670 (SK QB), 96 Sask. R. 177) is almost directly on point. In that case, a Crown witness inadvertently disclosed that the accused had served notice to seek a greater penalty by reason of prior conviction. After considering relevant authorities, the judge said that she had not read the record in the affidavit. In this case, the Crown did not have to disclose to the trial judge any indication of a criminal record. 2)The appeal must be allowed. The appeal must not be allowed and there is an order of prohibition granted on the reasoning that disclosure by a judge of a judge and a jury or a judge alone, doesn't amount to a disqualification from the Court of Appeal on the principle that inadvertent, inadmissible evidence will not be introduced. The evidence complained of was inadvertently introduced. If inadvertent errors should automatically result in termination of the proceedings, then more egregious, and perhaps deliberate, errors on the part of the Crown, or its witnesses, would necessitate no less result. A standard of perfection would then be required of Crown, standard which humans are quite incapable of achieving.","Appeal Allowed: [1] This appeal is from an order made by a Queen’s Bench judge prohibiting McMurtry P.C.J. from continuing as trial judge in respect of criminal charges against the respondent Herzberg.

It is common knowledge that pain can be exhausting; that daily physiotherapy can be exhausting; that daily travel of 2-1/2 hours can be exhausting; that the physical demands of farming can be exhausting; and, that the mental demands of managing a farm and coordinating and organizing the work of others on a farm can be exhausting. It was far from clear how SGI expected Sawkiw to devote approximately 6 to7 hours per day to his treatment program and still have the mental and physical reserves to devote any time or energy to his farming oprations. He could only reasonably be expected to participate in daily physiotherapy if he was receiving a full, rather than a partial income replacement benefit. 2)The benefits were properly terminated pursuant to s129(1)(e) the first day of his full time employment in Alberta.

desperate circumstances in October, 1997 and resulting

finds that SGI was not entitled to terminate Sawkiw\'s

finds that in accordance with s. 129(1)(e) Sawkiw\'s income

The defendant claimed the contract of employment was all inclusive; that the plaintiff exaggerated the amount of time he spent on the job in winter; that the reduced winter hours were not in lieu of overtime pay as he was a manager within the meaning of s.4(2) of the LSA; the doctrine of estoppel or waiver applied as he never claimed a right to holiday pay for 10 years and the employer relied on his not doing so; if the plaintiff is entitled to holiday pay he should only recover back to April 1990 as he is limited by the Limitation of Actions Act; it should not be based on wages plus truck allowance as wages as defined in the LSA does not include allowances for costs. The claim for unpaid holiday pay claimed from April 1988 to October 1997, based on his wages plus one-half his truck expense allowance, was reserved pending a decision by the Court of Appeal as to whether the Court of Queen's Bench has jurisdiction to determine the issue of entitlement to holiday pay. HELD: The claim was dismissed with costs.  1)The Court of Appeal held in Kolodziejski v. Auto Electric Service that the Queens' Bench has jurisdiction to entertain a civil action for non-payment of holiday pay. 2)The plaintiff may rely on s.30(1) of the LSA to establish he is entitled to holidays and on s.33 to establish he entitled to pay in lieu of taking holidays. The onus then shifts to the defendant to prove it complied with some exception in the LSA. Section 75 prevents an employee from waiving his or her entitlement. Whether the plaintiff asserted his right to holiday pay or not, he remained entitled to his annual holidays in accordance with the LSA. 3)The plaintiff can claim for any holiday pay in lieu of time off that he can establish he was entitled to from April 1990 to his termination date. Section 3(1)(f)of the LAA states that a cause of action for recovery of money under a contract, express or implied, must be commenced within 6 years of the date on which the cause arose. 4)The plaintiff clearly indicated that a portion of the truck allowance was made to avoid paying tax. As such it would be contrary to public policy for the Court to appear to endorse the plaintiff's actions by calculating his holiday pay on the basis of his wage and this portion of his truck allowance.  5)The defendant's position that the contract included a component of holiday pay each month was inconsistent with its position that the plaintiff took these days off as holidays during the year. The contract of employment did not include a component of holiday pay in lieu of time off.  6)Failure by the defendant to keep records for the purpose of inspection by the minister does not result in a reverse onus. The onus remains on the plaintiff to establish what holidays he did not take. 7)The plaintiff admitted to taking time away from his duties for personal time and for city business as mayor. The plaintiff was not there in his capacity as superintendent. Section 31(1)(b) indicates that an employee shall be permitted to take holidays in one uninterrupted period. The defendant allowed the plaintiff to take days off in any manner he chose. It was inconsistent that the plaintiff's failure to comply with the notice requirement meant for the benefit of the employer could be used by an employee to disclaim that his days off were holidays. 8)The plaintiff was clearly a manager within the meaning of LSA. Even if he were not a manager, he failed to prove, on a balance of probabilities that he worked overtime hours in excess of the statutory minimum in order to qualify for overtime. Any days off taken by the plaintiff could not be considered taken in lieu of overtime.

The defendant asserted that if the court found the plaintiff’s contract was not all-inclusive or that it did not exceed the minimum standards set out in the Labour Standards Act, the plaintiff should only be entitled to recover back to April 1990 as the plaintiff is limited by the Limitation of Actions Act, R.S. s. 1978, c.

The defendant claimed the contract of employment was all inclusive; that the plaintiff exaggerated the amount of time he spent on the job in winter; that the reduced winter hours were not in lieu of overtime pay as he was a manager within the meaning of s.4(2) of the LSA; the doctrine of estoppel or waiver applied as he never claimed a right to holiday pay for 10 years and the employer relied on his not doing so; if the plaintiff is entitled to holiday pay he should only recover back to April 1990 as he is limited by the Limitation of Actions Act; it should not be based on wages plus truck allowance as wages as defined in the LSA does not include allowances for costs. The claim for unpaid holiday pay claimed from April 1988 to October 1997, based on his wages plus one-half his truck expense allowance, was reserved pending a decision by the Court of Appeal as to whether the Court of Queen's Bench has jurisdiction to determine the issue of entitlement to holiday pay. HELD: The claim was dismissed with costs.  1)The Court of Appeal held in Kolodziejski v. Auto Electric Service that the Queens' Bench has jurisdiction to entertain a civil action for non-payment of holiday pay. 2)The plaintiff may rely on s.30(1) of the LSA to establish he is entitled to holidays and on s.33 to establish he entitled to pay in lieu of taking holidays. The onus then shifts to the defendant to prove it complied with some exception in the LSA. Section 75 prevents an employee from waiving his or her entitlement. Whether the plaintiff asserted his right to holiday pay or not, he remained entitled to his annual holidays in accordance with the LSA. 3)The plaintiff can claim for any holiday pay in lieu of time off that he can establish he was entitled to from April 1990 to his termination date. Section 3(1)(f)of the LAA states that a cause of action for recovery of money under a contract, express or implied, must be commenced within 6 years of the date on which the cause arose. 4)The plaintiff clearly indicated that a portion of the truck allowance was made to avoid paying tax. As such it would be contrary to public policy for the Court to appear to endorse the plaintiff's actions by calculating his holiday pay on the basis of his wage and this portion of his truck allowance.  5)The defendant's position that the contract included a component of holiday pay each month was inconsistent with its position that the plaintiff took these days off as holidays during the year. The contract of employment did not include a component of holiday pay in lieu of time off.  6)Failure by the defendant to keep records for the purpose of inspection by the minister does not result in a reverse onus. The onus remains on the plaintiff to establish what holidays he did not take. 7)The plaintiff admitted to taking time away from his duties for personal time and for city business as mayor. The plaintiff was not there in his capacity as superintendent. Section 31(1)(b) indicates that an employee shall be permitted to take holidays in one uninterrupted period. The defendant allowed the plaintiff to take days off in any manner he chose. It was inconsistent that the plaintiff's failure to comply with the notice requirement meant for the benefit of the employer could be used by an employee to disclaim that his days off were holidays. 8)The plaintiff was clearly a manager within the meaning of LSA. Even if he were not a manager, he failed to prove, on a balance of probabilities that he worked overtime hours in excess of the statutory minimum in order to qualify for overtime. Any days off taken by the plaintiff could not be considered taken in lieu of overtime.

The plaintiff asserted that the $250.00 portion of the truck allowance was made to avoid paying tax. In the alternative, the defendant claims that the plaintiff's holiday pay should be based on his wage, plus one-half of his truck expense allowance. HELD: The jury trial was to proceed with respect to the issues of liability and damages, reserving the issue on the basis of his wage and his truck allowance. The defendant asserted that if the court found the plaintiff’s contract was not all-inclusive or that it did not exceed the minimum standards set out in the Labour Standards Act, the plaintiff should only be entitled to recover back to April 1990 as the plaintiff is limited by the Limitation of Actions Act, R.S. s. 1978, c.

At the opening of their trial the accuseds applied for an order declaring ss.300 and 301 of the Criminal Code to be of no force and effect on the basis that they constituted an unreasonable limitation on their rights and freedoms guaranteed under ss.2, 7 and 11 of the Charter. The Crown admitted that ss.300 and 301 limited an individual's right to freedom of expression as provided by s.2 of the Charter but argued that this infringement was justified under s.1 of the Charter.

Twenty-two months passed between the laying of the charge and the trial date. Cote was not responsible for the delay and actively pursued a speedy trial. The delay was caused by the Crown's failure to provide timely disclosure. HELD: The charge was stayed. In applying the decision of the SCC in R. v. Morin, the court found that 22 months is an unreasonable and exceptional period of delay and is of sufficient length to warrant an inquiry. This case had no particular complexity above the norm for cases of this kind and did not require this delay. Cote did not directly or indirectly waive his s.11(b) right to be tried within a reasonable time. Cote was subject to substantial and sufficient prejudice by the delay. He suffered damage to his political career, embarrassment from media reports, unemployment, and economic hardship.

He sold it to the Wheat Pool for less than the cost of producing the crop. Any driving he had done was to help his son and drew no wages for it.

If the court can assume the defendant's evidence is true and still grant summary judgment there is no genuine need for a trial. 2)As noted in numerous decisions, whether an employer is justified in summarily dismissing an employee is ultimately a question of fact. The plaintiff was not terminated because of poor job performance in performing his contractual duties as foreman and manager but because of his alleged poor performance in doing the job normally assigned to two persons. The employer has the right to expect that employees will not disparage their immediate supervisors or other employees in the course of their employment and certainly not to clients or customers of the employer. The type of conduct here would not justify dismissal the first time it came to the employer's attention if the employee had been guilty of such conduct while performing only his own job function. 'Griping' is not uncommon in the workplace. The case law seems uniform that one or more warnings to an employee must be given before it can be said such activity 'fractures the employment relationship'. The category of misconduct can be said to change from poor attitude to disobedience or insubordination where dismissal results after one or more warnings. 3)The plaintiff was entitled to 7 months notice to reflect the fact that junior management positions are fewer in number and the considerable wage difference between management and non- management positions.  4)The plaintiff was entitled to taxable costs.","FIAT.

4_2008skqb174.txt,"Accused pleaded guilty at opening of trial to one count of distributing child pornography in the form of written works. The accused was active on a pedophile website and posted 11 stories describing sexual activity between men and infants and pre-teen girls. HELD: Accused received 15 months imprisonment followed by 3 years of probation with addition orders including providing DNA samples and being added to the Sex Offender Registry. The Court accepted that the internet has led to the accelerated proliferation of child pornography, making it an increasing social problem. The social harm of such material is borne almost exclusively by infants and children, the most defenceless members of society. For this reason, denunciation and deterrence are the dominant sentencing principles. The defence submitted that the writings do not actually harm children in their making and, therefore, should not be subject to the same denunciation as pornographic images. The Court rejected this argument because it cannot be assumed that the writings do not stimulate the demand for images and since not all pedophiles are voyeurs only some will act on their desires and anything that stimulates this desire places children at risk in the real world. Aggravating factors in this case were 1) the fact that the accused extolled pedophilia and wrote hard core child pornography and encouraged others to the same. 2) The accused was a high profile contributor to the web site and he remains unrepentant Ã» he does not believe there is anything wrong with writing these stories and only stopped because the law requires it. A conditional sentence would not represent sufficient denunciation or deterrence. Mitigating factors in this case included a lack of criminal record, the guilty plea and the fact that the accused is looking after his elderly mother.","The defendant pled guilty at the opening of trial to one count of distributing child pornography contrary to s. 163.1(3) of the Criminal Code. HELD: 1) The defendant was sentenced to 15 months imprisonment to be followed by a term of probation of 3 years. The defendant had no previous criminal record and was serving the useful social purpose of looking after his ailing mother who lives on an isolated acreage and who will also be punished if he is incarcerated.  2) A conditional sentence would not be a fit sentence on the facts in this matter, although the defendant qualifies for the same to be given to him. He has abided by his release conditions over the past two and half-years, has no prior criminal record, and is now serving a useful social role. He would not endanger the community if one were to be imposed. 3) The Court found that the defendant was not amenable to sex offender programming given the circumstances of the offence and the fact that he disclosed his stories were largely fantasies of what he would do with those two girls when they were under his roof. The Court also found that there was no evidence that he had any criminal record at the time of the offences. 4) The sentence was appropriate given the defendant's previous record and the mitigating factors referred to in R. v. Cohen, 144 O.A.C. 340 (C.A.) (CanLII) which upheld conditional sentences of 14 months and 18 months respectively for distribution of child pornography. 5) There were no aggravating factors to be considered in the sentencing of the defendant. 6) The court found the defendant to be in the wrong group and ordered that he be subject to an order requiring him to comply with the Sex Offender Information Registration Act, 2004, which is the mandatory time specified in s. 490.012(1) for a person convicted of sexually abusing a child. 7) There was nothing wrong with his memory or writing abilities. 8) The sentencing of a sentence of 15 months was not appropriate.","[1] Mr. Houston pled guilty at the opening of trial to one count of

HELD: Accused received 15 months imprisonment followed by 3 years of probation with addition orders including providing DNA samples and being added to the Sex Offender Registry. The Court accepted that the internet has led to the accelerated proliferation of child pornography, making it an increasing social problem. The social harm of such material is borne almost exclusively by infants and children, the most defenceless members of society. For this reason, denunciation and deterrence are the dominant sentencing principles. The defence submitted that the writings do not actually harm children in their making and, therefore, should not be subject to the same denunciation as pornographic images. The Court rejected this argument because it cannot be assumed that the writings do not stimulate the demand for images and since not all pedophiles are voyeurs only some will act on their desires and anything that stimulates this desire places children at risk in the real world. Aggravating factors in this case were 1) the fact that the accused extolled pedophilia and wrote hard core child pornography and encouraged others to the same. 2) The accused was a high profile contributor to the web site and he remains unrepentant Ã» he does not believe there is anything wrong with writing these stories and only stopped because the law requires it. A conditional sentence would not represent sufficient denunciation or deterrence. Mitigating factors in this case included a lack of criminal record, the guilty plea and the fact that the accused is looking after his elderly mother.","The defendant pled guilty at the opening of trial to one count of distributing child pornography contrary to s. 163.1(3) of the Criminal Code. HELD: 1) The defendant was sentenced to 15 months imprisonment to be followed by a term of probation of 3 years. The defendant had no previous criminal record and was serving the useful social purpose of looking after his ailing mother who lives on an isolated acreage and who will also be punished if he is incarcerated.  2) A conditional sentence would not be a fit sentence on the facts in this matter, although the defendant qualifies for the same to be given to him. He has abided by his release conditions over the past two and half-years, has no prior criminal record, and is now serving a useful social role. He would not endanger the community if one were to be imposed. 3) The Court found that the defendant was not amenable to sex offender programming given the circumstances of the offence and the fact that he disclosed his stories were largely fantasies of what he would do with those two girls when they were under his roof. The Court also found that there was no evidence that he had any criminal record at the time of the offences. 4) The sentence imposed was not appropriate given the defendant's record and the mitigating factors referred to in R. v. Cohen, 144 O.A.C. 340 (C.A.) (CanLII) which upheld conditional sentences of 14 months and 18 months respectively for distribution of child pornography. 5) There were no aggravating factors to consider in the sentencing of the defendant. 6) The court found the defendant to be in the wrong group and ordered that he be subject to an order requiring him to comply with the Sex Offender Information Registration Act, 2004, which is the mandatory time specified in s. 490.012(1) for a person convicted of sexually abusing a child.","[1] Mr. Houston pled guilty at the opening of trial to one count of
distributing child pornography, in the form of written works, between the 12th of
June and the 8th of August, 2005, contrary to s. 163.1(3) of the Criminal Code of
Canada. Mr. Houston was a high profile
contributor to the website during the time he was active, and he remains
unrepentant, meaning he does not yet believe there is anything wrong with writing
such stories, but simply agrees to stop doing so because the law requires it. [18] Based on the circumstances of this offence, and the circumstances
of the offender, I conclude that a conditional sentence would not be a fit sentence
on the facts in this matter, although I agree Mr. Houston qualifies for the same to
the extent a fit sentence would not exceed two years, and I agree on the limited
information available that he would not endanger the community if one were
imposed. A conditional sentence also would not be
strong enough to deter others who might be inclined to engage in the activity of
distributing child pornography. [19] I have taken into account the mitigating factors referred to by
counsel for the defence, such as the fact that Mr. Houston has no criminal record,
and did plead guilty, albeit at the opening of trial, along with the other material I
have referred to in the foregoing in arriving at what I consider to be the
appropriate length of sentence. Mr. Houston, I sentence you to 15 months
imprisonment, to be followed by a term of probation of three years, as well as the
additional orders I am about to make. Canada: (1) Pursuant to s. 490.012 of the Criminal Code, it is ordered you be

b_1996canlii5028.txt,"Guardian was the general liability insurer for Kellogg. Royal was the primary insurer as holder of Kellogg's blanket fleet coverage. Kellogg's employee was involved in a motor vehicle accident while on company business but was driving his wife's vehicle at the time of the accident. Royal denied coverage and refused to defend on the basis of an exclusionary provision regarding the use of substitute automobiles. It was held at trial that Royal was not obligated to participate. HELD: 1)The case law reveals some inconsistencies with respect to the relationship between the duty to defend and the coverage provided by the policy. Where the policy clearly does not provide coverage, the insurer had no duty to defend. Where a policy only provides coverage for some allegations the insurer is only obligated to defend those allegations which may trigger the obligation to indemnify. When a policy is ambiguous some courts have adopted Thames and have stated the mere possibility that the policy may provide coverage is sufficient to oblige the insurer to defend. 2)Section 209 provides no guidelines as to the scope of the inquiry the judge may engage in. The chamber judge did not define the scope of his inquiry and stated that the standard suggestion that Guardian must raise an arguable point was 'off target'. To determine whether an insurer has the obligation to defend a chamber judge must examine the coverage provided by the policy. The judge made no finding of ambiguity in the exclusionary provision. He simply determined the Honda was not covered by the Royal policy and did not decide the issue of indemnity. 3)The affidavit evidence indicated that the parties lived in the same premises thus that argument was without merit. CONCURRING JUDGMENT: The appeal was dismissed for different reasons.  1)There has been an acceptance of the general concept that the duty to defend is broader than the duty to indemnify. To order an insurer to defend a chamber judge need be less sure the policy provides coverage than would be the case for an actual determination of liability under the policy. 2)There was a factual element which could not be determined on this application such as whether a partially deflated tire constitutes a breakdown within the meaning of the policy and whether the automobile the employee was driving was owned by someone living in the same dwelling. 3)The question centered around the words used in clause 5 of the policy and who it referred to.

In the meantime, the Municipality's road construction specifications had become more stringent and his proposal did not comply with the new specifications. The development officer found the application to be incomplete and the applicant applied for certiorari and mandamus. Certiorari granted; declaration issued that application for final subdivision approval was complete; order for mandamus granted and the development officer directed to issue final approval (subject only to the applicant correcting the technical error in the plan). The development officer's decision was based on interpretation of relevant legislation and the proper standard of review is correctness. The development officer misinterpreted the legislation. Since the applicant had already received tentative approval under the old regime, it did not have to meet the new higher standards for final approval. There was not another legal remedy open to the applicant equally convenient, beneficial and appropriate. The right of appeal under the legislation existed only from a refusal by a development officer and technically, this was not a refusal as the application was found incomplete. Both the right of appeal under the Act and the Board's power to grant an appeal were limited, either of which could result in the applicant having no remedy","Land developer after applying for but failing to receive final subdivision approval looks to the Court for relief including an order in the nature of certiorari quashing the development officer's decision that the application was incomplete and an order of mandamus directing the Development Officer to issue the final approval. HELD: The application was granted. 1)It is significant that the right of appeal is from a refusal. The applicant received tentative approval before the new road standards were incorporated.

communications in relation to an offence under s. 271(1) of the Criminal Code. [33] In this case if there was a breach it was not serious and was inadvertent -
the result of unmindful draftsmanship. As a result, I view the seriousness of the breach, if there was

does not violate the accused's s. 8 rights.",0.5212121212121213,0.46551724137931033,"This is an application by the accused for an order that evidence obtained by way of a telephone interception be ruled inadmissible because it is irrelevant. Alternatively, the accused seeks exclusion of the intercepted communication on the basis that it was conducted in violation of s. 8 of the Charter and ought to be excluded under s. 24(2). The accused is charged with abuse of a position of trust contrary to s. 153(1)(a) of the Code. HELD: The evidence is admissible. The accused's application is dismissed. 1) After examining the transcript of the conversation, it is immediately evident that the contents of the communication are relevant. The complainant and the accused are discussing the intimate details of their relationship. The conversation is logically probative to the charge. 2) The learned provincial court judge did in fact have sufficient evidence before him to issue the telephone intercept authorization. The complainant was prepared to initiate a telephone call to the accused and engage him in a conversation which would likely cause the accused to make admissions or statements which could be confirmatory of her allegations. 3) The authorization clearly permits the police to intercept private communications in relation to an offence under s. 271(1) of the Code. That investigation was live and bona fide at the time that the authorization was obtained. The law in this country is that evidence of other crimes revealed during the course of a lawful intercept process does not render the evidence obtained inadmissible in relation to an offence not named in the authorization. The focus is on whether the interception was lawfully obtained and executed, not on what is discovered. Here the police obtained a valid authorization to intercept private communications in relation to an offence under s. 271(1) of the Code. During the investigation of that charge, they obtained evidence which is relevant to an offence under s. 153(1)(a) of the Code. The fact that the offence of s. 153(1)(a) is not named in the authorization nor included as an offence for which an authorization to intercept private communications could be obtained, does not affect the admissibility of the evidence. Therefore, there is no Charter breach. 4) Even if the evidence was obtained in violation of s. 8 of the Charter, such evidence is considered non-conscriptive evidence. Where the evidence is non-conscriptive, the court ought to go on to do a balancing as to whether or not the evidence ought to be excluded pursuant to s. 24(2) of the Charter. The factors to be considered are trial fairness, seriousness of the breach and the effect of exclusion. In this case if there is a breach, it was not serious and was inadvertent, the result of unmindful draftsmanship. There is no evidence of bad faith. There is no evidence of manipulation. The seriousness of the breach, if there was one, was minimal, and to admit the evidence would not bring the administration of justice into disrepute.","The accused applied for an order that evidence obtained by way of a telephone interception be ruled inadmissible because it is neither a charge listed in the definition section nor a section that creates an offence under the Criminal Code. Alternatively, the accused sought exclusion of the intercepted communication on the basis that it was conducted in violation of s.8 of the Charter. HELD: The evidence was inadmissible because it was irrelevant. 1)The evidence was relevant and admissible. The evidence did not violate the accused's s. 8 rights. 2)There was no Charter breach and the evidence was non-conscriptive evidence. 3)If there was a breach it was not serious and was inadvertent -the result of unmindful draftsmanship. There was no evidence of bad faith. 4)The accused argued that because the wiretap evidence was obtained outside of the framework of the authorization, unless the Crown can prove that the evidence would have inevitably been discovered, admission of that evidence would not bring the administration of justice into disrepute.

The co-accused threw hot liquid from the cup directly into the complainant's face and the three inmates commenced stabbing the complainant with weapon. second complainant inmate attempted to intervene to assist the first complainant and the accused and co-accused began to stab the second complainant. The first complainant suffered severe first and second degree burns to his face and to his shoulders as well as numerous puncture wounds and lacerations but was not critically injured. The accused was charged with aggravated assault on the first complainant and common assault on the second complainant. None of the inmates testified at trial other than the accused. The accused testified that he felt he was being shunned in the Block and had received threats from the first complainant and others in the complainant's group who were brandishing shanks earlier that day. The defence argued that the Crown failed to prove that the injuries caused to the first complainant fell within the definition of 'wound, maim, disfigure or endanger life'; and that the acts done to the first and second complainants were in self-defence as contemplated by s. 34 of the Criminal Code. HELD: The accused was convicted of both counts. 1) In relation to the accused's defence of self-defence pursuant to s. 34(2) pertaining to the first complainant, the Court found the accused did not believe that he was being assaulted within the meaning of the law and, even if he did hold this belief, such a belief was not reasonable in the circumstances. Further, the Court did not accept, on a subjective or objective basis, that the accused reasonably believed that the first complainant had the present ability to carry out the threat, notwithstanding that the physical aspect of the assault need not be imminent or immediate. Lastly, the Court found that the accused did not believe that he had no other option. The accused admitted that he had other options but chose not to avail himself of them. 2) The Court found it did not need to assess the application of s. 37 of the Code in relation to the common assault charge. Rather, the Court found s. 27 of the Code applicable and determined that the second complainant was legally justified to use as much force as was reasonably necessary to prevent the commission of an offence which would be arrestable without warrant. The Court found the second complainant was clothed in legal justification and the accused was not entitled to the protection of s. 34(1) because the accused provoked the assault, and the force he used was more than necessary to defend himself as the accused was armed with a shank and the second complainant was not.","The accused was charged with aggravated assault and one count of common assault relating to a violent incident that took place in the maximum security unit of the Saskatchewan Penitentiary at approximately 8:30 p.m. on September 1, 2008. The accused and two alleged victims were inmates at the prison and were being held on 'B' Block, range designated for gang members. Given that the incident was captured by two security videos, there is no doubt as to what happened. The issues raised by the accused pertain to how his actions ought to be characterized. Section 34(2) of the Criminal Code attaches criminal responsibility to a person as party to an offence if that person, with the requisite intent, plays any one of three roles in the offence. If the person actually commits the offence, liability follows; (b) s. 21(1)(b) imposes liability by virtue of person doing, or omitting to do, acts for the purpose of aiding principal to commit the offence; (c) is objectively reasonable on the basis of the situation that he perceives; and (d) the mens rea requirement for aggravated assault is an objective foresight of bodily harm.","[1] The accused, Frederick Junior Knife (the “accused” or “Knife”), is charged with one count of aggravated assault and one count of common assault relating to a violent incident that took place in the maximum security unit of the Saskatchewan Penitentiary at approximately 8:30 p.m. on September 1, 2008. [33] I will next deal with the argument that Knife’s actions against Dorion were done in self‑defence as contemplated by s. 34(2) of the Criminal Code. [63] Accordingly, I conclude that the accused did not believe that he was being assaulted, within the meaning of the law, and that, even if he did hold this belief, which I find not to be the case, such a belief was not reasonable in the circumstances. Nonetheless, I reject both the subjective and objective components of the second prong of the test for the same reasons that I rejected the first prong of the test. However, as I stated previously, I do not accept, on a subjective or objective basis, Knife reasonably believed that Dorion had the present ability to carry out the threat, notwithstanding that the physical aspect of the assault need not be imminent or immediate. [71] Firstly, dealing with the subjective element, I find that Knife did not believe that he had no other option. However, I do not need to assess the application of s. 37 because I find that s. 27 of the Criminal Code is applicable. Consequently, I find that Demeria was clothed in legal justification when he entered the fray. I find, as well, that Knife is not entitled to the protection of s. 34(1) because Knife provoked the assault, and the force he used was more than necessary to enable him to defend himself. It is obvious from the video recordings that Knife was armed with a shank, whereas Demeria was not, and that stabbing Demeria and holding him so that he could not get away, as Dreaver and Knife were doing, was far more force than was necessary to enable him to defend himself. Conclusion [90] In the final analysis, I find that the Crown has made out all of the elements of both counts beyond a reasonable doubt and, therefore, find Frederick Junior Knife guilty of both Count 1 and Count 2 as specified in the indictment.",0.3904109589041096,0.29203539823008845,"In the evening, the accused inmate and his two co-accused inmates placed themselves in close proximity to the complainant inmate at table at the Penitentiary.

Further, the Court did not accept, on a subjective or objective basis, that the accused reasonably believed that the first complainant had the present ability to carry out the threat, notwithstanding that the physical aspect of the assault need not be imminent or immediate. Lastly, the Court found that the accused did not believe that he had no other option. The accused admitted that he had other options but chose not to avail himself of them. 2) The Court found it did not need to assess the application of s. 37 of the Code in relation to the common assault charge. Rather, the Court found s. 27 of the Code applicable and determined that the second complainant was legally justified to use as much force as was reasonably necessary to prevent the commission of an offence which would be arrestable without warrant. The Court found the second complainant was clothed in legal justification and the accused was not entitled to the protection of s. 34(1) because the accused provoked the assault, and the force he used was more than necessary to defend himself as the accused was armed with a shank and the second complainant was not.","The accused was charged with aggravated assault and one count of common assault relating to a violent incident that took place in the maximum security unit of the Saskatchewan Penitentiary at approximately 8:30 p.m. on September 1, 2008.

Given that the incident was captured by two security videos, there is no doubt as to what happened. The issues raised by the accused pertain to how his actions ought to be characterized. Section 34(2) of the Criminal Code attaches criminal responsibility to a person as party to an offence if that person, with the requisite intent, plays any one of three roles in the offence. If the person actually commits the offence, liability follows; (b) s. 21(1)(b) imposes liability by virtue of person doing, or omitting to do, acts for the purpose of aiding principal to commit the offence; (c) is objectively reasonable on the basis of the situation that he perceives; and (d) the mens rea requirement for aggravated assault is an objective foresight of bodily harm.","[1] The accused, Frederick Junior Knife (the “accused” or “Knife”), is charged with one count of aggravated assault and one count of common assault relating to a violent incident that took place in the maximum security unit of the Saskatchewan Penitentiary at approximately 8:30 p.m. on September 1, 2008. [33] I will next deal with the argument that Knife’s actions against Dorion were done in self‑defence as contemplated by s. 34(2) of the Criminal Code.

It is obvious from the video recordings that Knife was armed with a shank, whereas Demeria was not, and that stabbing Demeria and holding him so that he could not get away, as Dreaver and Knife were doing, was far more force than was necessary to enable him to defend himself.

result of defence counsel`s application to remove the
prosecution counsel prior to the preliminary hearing (October
27, 1997 - June 2, 1998). Crown. What is known, is the accused`s right to a
fair trial has not been prejudiced by the total time
delay involved. [16] The foregoing points cause me to conclude the Crown
in opposing the application did so in good faith,
and it did have a meritorious position (regardless
of whether it was a winning position) (Vide: R. v.
Sander (1995), 1995 CanLII 1229 (BC CA), 30 C.R.R. (2d) 359 (B.C.C.A.), per
Finch J.A., at pp. 368-69). He agrees the delay has not resulted in a diminution
of his ability to make full answer and defence. I thus describe the
prejudice to his liberty interest as minor. CONCLUSION [19] Taking the foregoing factors into account I conclude
the delay in the circumstances outlined above was not
unreasonable.",0.5793991416309012,0.6401673640167365,FIAT. The accused sought a judicial stay of proceedings pursuant to s.24(1) and s.2) of the Charter on the basis his right under s.11(b) to be tried within a reasonable time has been breached. HELD: The application was dismissed. 1)The accused's right to a fair trial has not been prejudiced by the total delay involved. His right to security of the person and his right to liberty were not affected during this period. The Court found that the accused had been on bail since shortly after his arrest. He agreed the delay had not resulted in a diminution of his ability to make full answer and defence. He has been employed throughout the period of delay thus avoiding the possibility of the matter being argued twice.  2)The Crown did not share in the responsibility for the delay. 3)The time for measuring delay was from the time the charge is laid until the date of trial. The Crown did have a meritorious position (regardless of whether it was a winning position) and all other proceedings were within the systemic guidelines.
6_2017skca42.txt,"Statutes – Interpretation – Limitation of Civil Rights Act, Section 2The appellants had granted a residential mortgage in favour of the respondent that secured a loan in the amount of $460,800. The loan was a consolidation of existing debt, part of which was the balance of $373,089 owed on the original loan that had enabled the appellants to purchase the land. The remaining $87,711 was non-purchase money financing approved by the respondent. The appellants fell into default, and the respondent commenced foreclosure proceedings when the balance owed had increased to $536,186. The property was sold through judicial listing orders and the net sale proceeds were paid to the respondent. As the proceeds were insufficient, the respondent sought an order entitling it to the deficiency. The Chambers judge considered s. 2 of The Limitation of Civil Rights Act (LCRA) and held that the amount of the deficiency should be $162,675.99. The issues on appeal were how the proceeds of sale should be applied against the mortgage balance and what the proper amount of the deficiency was. HELD: The appeal was allowed. The court reviewed the purpose and policy behind the LCRA. It then examined its conflicting decisions in Hrynewich Holdings and Andrews and held that the latter was a per incuriam judgment and therefore not binding and the approach set out in Hrynewich would guide the disposition of this appeal. Therefore, it found with respect to each issue that the holding in Hrynewich meant that payments should be allocated on a pro-rated basis to purchase money and non-purchase money debt balances and the proper amount of the deficiency to which the respondent was entitled to judgment against the appellants was $31,160.23.","This appeal concerns the application of s. 25 of the Limitation of Civil Rights Act in relation to a motion for deficiency judgment by the respondent bank. The main issue relates to how the proceeds of sale of property by judicial listing should be applied against mortgage balance when there are both purchase money and non-purchase money balances. The Chambers judge considered s. 2 of the Saskatchewan Real Property Security Law and held that the amount of the deficiency judgment should be $162,675. This amount was calculated as follows: $536,186.72 total amount owed to March 23, 2016 ($372,485.01); $87,711.48 balance owed and amount of deficiency judgment III. Hrynewich Holdings accords with the policy behind the legislation as set out earlier in this judgment. The court reviewed the Chambers judge’s decision in Andrew (CA) and found that the proceeds from the judicial sale must be applied to the purchase money portion of the loan. However, the respondent then sought an order entitling it to the deficiency. The Court found that s.2 of the LCRA protects the debtor from an action on the personal covenant to pay the unpaid balance owing for mortgage taken in part to secure the purchase price of farmland. It also found that any deficiency claim should be limited to the portion of any shortfall to which the original purchase money advanced related to the initial funds advanced. HELD: The appeal was allowed and the respondent was entitled to take out a deficiency judgment of $31,160.23 against the appellants.

1998canlii3382.txt,"The appellant employer and the respondent union are parties to a collective agreement with effect from January 1, 1994 to December 31, 1996. The collective agreement established employee salaries for that period, with annual adjustments on January 1st of each year. Shortly before the agreement was signed, the Public Sector Compensation Act was passed, which rolled back and froze public sector salaries. In a letter to the union, the employer confirmed the wage increases provided for in the agreement would be paid to the employees as a lump sum following the expiration of the legislated wage freeze. After the expiration of the wage freeze, however, the employer refused to pay the lump sum on the grounds that it would contravene the Act. The union sued the employer in the Supreme Court, claiming the lump sum or, in the alternative, damages for negligent misrepresentation. The employer applied to strike the Statement of Claim on the grounds that the union's claims were within the exclusive jurisdiction of an arbitrator. The Chambers judge dismissed the application. The employer appealed. Allowing the appeal and staying the action pending submission to arbitration as provided for in the collective agreement, that the Chambers judge erred in allowing the action to continue.

5_2001skqb98.txt,"Issues of divorce, custody and access were disposed of by judgment given during the course of the trial by consent of the parties. Matrimonial property was to be divided, maintenance for the children and spousal support were to be determined. HELD: 1)Access was to be mutually agreed upon with the 18 year old to whom the respondent stood in loco parentis.  2)Expert evidence of tax implications was not called as the respondent failed to give notice as required by the Rules of Court. 3)The mother's annual income for purposes of the Guidelines was fixed at $11,376 not including the $300 child support she received from the natural father of the 18 year old. The respondent's farming income was determined on a 3 year average as it varied from year to year. The facts justified adding back 25% of the capital cost allowance on the machinery over the last 3 years for Guideline purposes. Day care and play school costs of $440 per month were to be divided according to their proportionate share based on the Guidelines. The respondent was to pay one-half of the cost of extra curricular activities and any future activities as agreed upon. The approach used in Cook v. Kilduff was adopted and the amount for the two natural children was deducted from the amount payable for three children.

If he does not have particulars of the statutes and regulations, he must so state. 2) The court was not prepared to strike the phrases 'without limiting the generality of the foregoing' and 'without limitation'. The conduct of examination for discovery and undertakings can provide the defendant with particulars of allegations to be made by the plaintiff in order to permit it to properly defend the action.  3) The Government demanded full particulars of the breach of trust and breach of fiduciary duty. The plaintiff's response does not lay a foundation for either and the paragraphs are struck.  4) The court was satisfied that exemplary damages and punitive damages were synonymous and therefore only one of them should be pled to avoid confusion. The court directed that any reference to exemplary damages should be read as to include punitive damages and that only one phrase should be used. 5) As the cause of action clearly predates the coming into force of The Pre-judgment Interest Act, the provisions of that Act have no application to the plaintiff's claim.","The Government of Saskatchewan (the Government) sought an order pursuant to Rule 164(4) of the Queen's Bench Rules requiring the defendant to provide better particulars in response to its demand for particulars, and in default of so doing striking the offending portions of the statement of claim.

Q.B.) where the phrases 'without limiting the generality of the foregoing' and 'without limitation' were struck. In the circumstances here, the plaintiff cites samples of cases involving similar open ended phrases and submits that such wording is common and should be permitted by the courts.
