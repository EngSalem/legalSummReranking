 3)The plaintiff was entitled to 7 months notice to reflect the fact that junior management positions are fewer in number and the considerable wage difference between management and non- management positions.","FIAT. The plaintiff applied for summary judgment in his claim for dismissal without just cause. The plaintiff was initially hired as body shop foreman but additionally acquired the title of assistant manager. When the body shop manager became ill that work load also fell to the plaintiff. It was during this period that the performance of the plaintiff, described by the defendant as serious misconduct, resulted in his termination. There was no issue of a lack of mitigation as the plaintiff accepted a job with another autobody shop but at a much lower rate of pay. The action was brought pursuant to the simplified procedure outlined in Part 40 of the Rules of Court. HELD: Damages were to be calculated by the parties for the 7 month notice period based on his income and value of benefits over the previous year, less the 6 weeks pay received, and less wages and benefits received from his new employment. Jurisdiction was reserved to hear further evidence should the parties not reach agreement. 1)By using the words 'shall grant judgment unless', Rule 488 requires the presiding judge to grant judgment except in the circumstances outlined in s.488(a)and(b). The test is not whether there is contradictory evidence in the affidavits but whether despite the contradictory evidence the issue(s) can be decided in the absence of cross-examination and it would be otherwise unjust to do so. If the court can assume the defendant's evidence is true and still grant summary judgment there is no genuine need for a trial. 2)As noted in numerous decisions, whether an employer is justified in summarily dismissing an employee is ultimately a question of fact. The plaintiff was not terminated because of poor job performance in performing his contractual duties as foreman and manager but because of his alleged poor performance in doing the job normally assigned to two persons. The employer has the right to expect that employees will not disparage their immediate supervisors or other employees in the course of their employment and certainly not to clients or customers of the employer. The type of conduct here would not justify dismissal the first time it came to the employer's attention if the employee had been guilty of such conduct while performing only his own job function. 'Griping' is not uncommon in the workplace. The case law seems uniform that one or more warnings to an employee must be given before it can be said such activity 'fractures the employment relationship'. The category of misconduct can be said to change from poor attitude to disobedience or insubordination where dismissal results after one or more warnings. 3)The plaintiff was entitled to 7 months notice to reflect the fact that junior management positions are fewer in number and the considerable wage difference between management and non- management positions.  4)The plaintiff was entitled to taxable costs.","FIAT. The plaintiff applies for summary judgment in his claim for dismissal without just cause brought pursuant to the simplified procedure outlined in Part Forty of the Rules of Court. The defendant opposes the application and requests a summary trial. HELD: The plaintiff is entitled to 7 months notice. 1) The defendant bears the burden of demonstrating there is a genuine need for trial.  2) The plaintiff was able to obtain employment within approximately two and one-half months of the end of the notice period given to him by the employer at wage considerably below what he had earned with the defendant. The evidence establishes the plaintiff applied to numerous autobody businesses prior to accepting the employment he did and was not successful in obtaining an equivalent position at an equivalent salary. 3) In the case of a person in the plaintiff's position, who occupied a junior managerial position in a very specific industry, the notice periods should reflect that management positions are fewer in number than non-management positions, and that there was a considerable wage difference between a management position and one that was assigned to two persons. 4) Taking all factors into account, the Court considers this is an appropriate notice period to which the plaintiff was entitled."

 There was no evidence to support the allegation that the usual Guideline amount was 'inappropriate' in this case; the Act prohibited the consideration of public income assistance when fixing child support; given the uncertainty about the son's future, this was not an appropriate case for a time-limited order.","The son of unmarried parents, who had graduated from high school, was working part-time, living with his mother and had not made a final decision on a further course of study sustained a serious brain injury just a few months after his 19th birthday. He required extensive rehabilitation and would not regain his pre-accident physical and intellectual capacity. The mother successfully applied for a reinstatement of child support which had been discontinued by consent, pre-accident, when the son was residing with the father.

The conversation is logically probative to the charge. 2) The learned provincial court judge did in fact have sufficient evidence before him to issue the telephone intercept authorization.

HELD: The motions are dismissed with no order as to costs.  1) One of defendants contends that 7 people alleged by the plaintiffs to be viable class members have already entered into a full and final settlement with the defendant. This defendant earlier sought to examine these individuals. The Justice of this action at that time did not allow the examination but instead made an order permitting the defendant to file affidavits on the issue. This is the source of the affidavit the plaintiff seeks cross-examination on. The order also allowed the plaintiffs to file reply affidavits, which they chose not to do. There is nothing in the original order that could be interpreted as saying that the plaintiffs could cross-examine on the affidavit. In the view of the Court, having chosen not to file reply affidavits pursuant to the original order, it is not reasonable for plaintiff's counsel to embark on a totally different approach several weeks after the deadline has passed. There is also some concern that the actual purpose of the proposed cross-examination would be more general and broad-ranging than a mere challenge to the defendant's assertion that the individuals at issue have already entered into full and final settlements with the defendant.  2) In its barest sense, plaintiffs' counsel requests that the defendant supply a plaintiff by way of sending pre-certification notices to its clients. The Court is aware of Lewis v. Shell, where an Ontario court ordered notice to potential class members. However, that case is not similar to this case. In the Lewis case, the Court was faced with concern over the defendant contacting individuals who might be potential class members for the purpose of obtaining early settlements. Moreover, the Ontario class actions legislation is less restrictive than Saskatchewan's. The section of the Class Action Act which may permit such an order refer to a 'class action,' not an 'action.' As this case is still in the pre-certification stage, it is not yet a class action within the meaning of the Act. Spavier v. Canada also indicates that pre-certification motions of this sort would rarely be successful in this jurisdiction.","The plaintiff brought a motion pursuant to s. 12 of The Class Actions Act for an order compelling the defendant to serve pre-certification notices to the class members who had booked a vacation through Red Seal to stay at a resort in Cuba between November 2004 and February 2005. The plaintiffs applied for certification. The defendant moved to dismiss the claim against it on the basis that there was no plaintiff named in the statement of claim who purchased the Holguin vacation package from Red Seal. The plaintiff sought to have the action against itself struck for failure to produce a proper representative plaintiff. HELD: The motion was dismissed. The court found that the plaintiff could not rely on s. 14 or s. 24 of the Act to make pre- certification orders. The Court found that there had not been any previous cases in which a plaintiff was allowed to cross examine a defendant on an affidavit. 1) The court dismissed the application for examination on the Moore affidavit. 2) It was not in the court's view that the usual approach to civil litigation does not allow for plaintiff to demand defendant produce a plaintiff. However, the wording of s.14 and s.24 of our Act in my view precludes this type of pre certification notice. 3) There was no reference by the court to s14 or s24 of the class action Act. It would appear that the court was concentrating more on common law regarding the preliminary conflict objection. 4) The Court's inherent jurisdiction is to be exercised judicially and only when relief sought cannot reasonable and realistically be obtained by the applications in some other lawful manner."

HELD: The respondent was awarded an amount less than that of the respondent. The IRB was reduced by 90% to determine the respondent's net income. 1) The respondent's IRB is calculated in accordance with s117(3). It would be neither a rational nor fair interpretation to reduce a full-time earner’s IRB by more than 90% and not the other types of earners. 2) The hearing judge raised no concern with respect to the 'weighted average approach' used by SGI in calculating the respondent’ sIRB when it made the requisite deductions as set out in s. 137 and then reduced the net income to 90%. 3) SGI was correctly deducting the amount of Canada Pension Plan benefits Montgrand was receiving. 4) The appellant was not entitled to any more costs from SGI.

Both parties have some health problems. Originally, the appellant was ordered to pay the respondent $300.00 in monthly spousal support for a period of 1 year. Given the appellant's health difficulties and the fact that he was nearing retirement, the trial judge noted that the respondent would do well to become self-sufficient as soon as possible. The Chambers judge who reviewed the original order found that, during the year period the respondent was collecting spousal support, she had not engaged in any gainful employment.

The Crown applied to have a witness, who was an unindicted co-conspirator and separately charged with drug offences arising out of the same investigation, declared adverse pursuant to s9 of the Canada Evidence Act. She had contradicted her prior video taped statement made shortly after her arrest and had demonstrated hostile attitude towards the Crown.

It was the court's decision that the mere fact that the parties had dealt with a matter in the contract did not inevitably mean that they intended to exclude the right to sue in a tort.

The father applied to vary child support in November on the basis of his reduced income. HELD: The application was dismissed with costs to the petitioner fixed at $1,000. The onus is on the applicant to provide cogent, independent or objective verification of change of circumstances. This application was brought 10 months after the pre-trial conference. It was of no consequence that someone may come into the home rather than using commercial day care service. There was no change in the father's hours of work or the schedule. The only change was that the mother was no longer available to provide care during Saturday of his access weekends. The mother was not to schedule activities during the father's access periods without his consent and he was to provide 7 days written notice if he chooses not to exercise access during specified times. This was not a variation of the custody/access regime but rather specific directions to provide some predictability for the children.","The consent judgment of January 10, 2000 provided that the respondent shall have access to the children of the marriage at all reasonable times including the following: 1) on alternate weekends from Friday evening until Sunday evening at 8:30 p.m., to be extended to Monday evening in the event of a long weekend; and 2) that if the respondent chooses not to exercise access during any of his specified access times he is to provide seven days written notice to the petitioner.

The onus is on the individual to provide cogent, and where possible, independent or objective verification of the change of circumstances. This application was brought just ten months after the pre-trial conference. It is evident from the affidavit material filed by both parties that there is a substantial and ongoing conflict between them which affects their ability to make arrangements with respect to the parenting provisions in the consent judgment. As a result there will be an order requiring a spouse to pay for the support of any or all children in the marriage. This order will be made pursuant to s. 15.1(3) of the Act including basic support in a table amount based upon the imputed income. The alternative is that it is simply an agreed upon amount that differs from the amount that would be determined in accordance with the guidelines. HELD: The application was dismissed with costs fixed in the amount of $1,000. 1) The Court found that it was not necessary to determine which of these alternate approaches constitutes the basis of the consent judgement as the material question before the Court at this time is the same in both instances. If the parties agreed to impute income the respondent has the onus of satisfying the Court that a material change has occurred since the making of the child support order or the last variation order made in respect of that order.

He now resides with his common law partner of four years but offers minimal information about his intended activities upon release. He owns no real property and has identified no significant activities which connect him to the jurisdiction. HELD: The application is dismissed.  1)The applicant's status as a Convention refugee and Canada's non-refoulement obligations do not displace the well-established requirement that a court considering an application for an extradition proceeding must limit the assumption of a risk of non-appearance more severely than might otherwise be acceptable in an application by an offender made directly under s.679(3)(c).  2)There is no reason to consider the third test under s679. It is sufficient that the applicant has shown that he has not met that threshold.  3)The application for interim judicial release was dismissed."

 With respect to the claim that the defendant breached The Animal Protection Act, the essence of the claim is to seek damages against the plaintiff for the loss of the service dog..
 That portion of the claim must be struck because the plaintiffs cannot circumvent the provisions of The Animal Protection Act, 1999 nor eliminate the defendant’s right to be charged and tried in Provincial Court through the expediency of claiming a declaration in a civil suit..
 The third claim is that the defendant was negligent in allowing other children to interact with the service dog will not be struck because, assuming the facts in the pleadings are true, the claim for damages is viable..

In February 2013, the defendant informed the family that the children's provisional approval to attend the school would not be extended for the 2013-2014 school year. The Lawless family applied to strike out the plaintiffs' claim. HELD: The application was reserved and the application for an interlocutory injunction was dismissed with written reasons to follow. The Court found that the CÉF's decision to not renew the children’s provisional permission was based on the Lawless parents’ failure to live up to their ten commitments and failure to encourage learning of the French language in partnership with the school. The court found that it was not in the best interests of the children to continue attending the school because support for their success did not exist in this case."
