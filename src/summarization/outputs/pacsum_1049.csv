Sorenson unrepresented D.L.
The appellant appeals the sentence imposed by the trial judge after a trial where he was found guilty of assault contrary to s. 267(1)(b) of the Code.
He was fined $1200, with a surcharge of $120 and placed on probation for 12 months.
The sole issue on the sentence appeal is whether the trial judge erred in not ordering an unconditional discharge in the circumstances of this essentially domestic altercation.
The appellant and his spouse arrived at the Avenue Hotel parking lot in Prince Albert where they by chance encountered his spouse's former husband, John Watson.
Watson had apparently made some threat to the appellant's spouse concerning their children.
The appellant warned Watson to stay away from his spouse and the children and to stay off the Muskoday reserve.
Watson apparently turned towards the appellant with his fists clenched and the appellant struck him.
Watson fell and the appellant kicked him in the groin and walked away.
Watson recovered and attempted to continue the fight but was struck again and then threatened by the appellant.","Warrant issued to search a dwelling house for weapons allegedly used in an attempted armed robbery.

May 27, 1994This is an application for an order setting aside the default judgment and writ of execution issued against the applicants (plaintiffs, defendants by counterclaim) pursuant to Queen's Bench Rule 346 and for an order setting aside all garnishee summonses issued pursuant to Queen's Bench Rule 441 and s. 10 of The Attachment of Debts Act, R.S.S.
1978, c. A- 32.
FACTSThe applicants, acting on their own but with some obvious assistance from a solicitor in the preparation of their statement of claim, commenced an action on February 23, 1994 against the respondents who were represented by counsel.
On March 8 the applicants were served with a notice of intention to defend and on March 14 were served with a statement of defence and counterclaim.
On March 18 the respondents filed two separate affidavits for garnishee summons before judgment naming Bank of Nova Scotia and Saskatoon Credit Union respectively as garnishees.
The applicants did not file a statement of defence to the counterclaim within the time limit.
On the same date the respondents filed a praecipe for writ of execution.","This was an appeal from a decision dismissing the appellant's application for an order in the nature of certiorari to quash the decision of the Social Assistance Appeal Board for the City of Halifax which affirmed the rejection of the appellant's application for municipal social assistance as an expectant mother.
The appellant was a pregnant unmarried 16 year old living with her parents at the time of her application for social assistance.
The trial judge concluded that under Municipal Assistance Policy 1.2.5 the applicant was not eligible since she was not a single head of a family maintaining a home for herself and her dependant child.
Allowing the appeal,
that s. 23(1) of the Social Assistance Act places a mandatory responsibility upon social service committees to provide assistance for all persons in need as defined in s. 19(e) of the Act.
Pursuant to this statute, the City of Halifax has approved municipal assistance policies and Policy 1.2.5 relating to an 'Unmarried Mother - Pending Birth' was intended to set out the circumstances under which an unmarried mother was to be eligible.
It was not intended that the appellant have to be already maintaining a home for herself and one or more dependant children.
In a dissenting opinion, Chipman, J.A. concluded that as the provision with respect to an 'Unmarried Mother - Pending Birth' came under the heading 'Single Head of Family', the provision is merely an extension to include within the definition of a single head of a family an unwed mother whose child is not yet born.
The requirement that she be a single head of a family maintaining a home still stands.","[1, 0, 2, 5, 4, 8, 7, 9, 10, 12, 6, 14]"

Krawchuk for the Applicant Murray W. Douglas for the Respondent JUDGMENT WIMMER J. June 2, 2009[1] A bankruptcy petition against the applicant was filed on May 18, 1995 and a receiving order with respect to her property issued the following month.
KPMG Inc. (formerly Peat Marwick Thorne Inc.) is the trustee of her bankrupt estate.
The applicant received an absolute discharge on March 8, 1996.
The trustee has never applied for a discharge.

by the Bankruptcy and Insolvency Act, S.C. 1992, c. 27, s.2 (the “Act”), stated there were no facts, matters or circumstances that would justify the court in refusing an unconditional order of discharge.
Now, more than 13 years later, there remains an unresolved issue concerning non-exempt equity in the applicant’s homestead.","This was an application for an interim injunction restraining the respondents from further proceedings against the applicant, in particular restraining a sentencing hearing, in respect of charges of professional misconduct.
The application was made pending the outcome of an application for certiorari quashing the decision of the disciplinary panel.
The Appeal Court had refused to issue an interim injunction restraining the disciplinary hearing, holding that the courts should not interfere with the tribunal's proceedings until its completion except in very exceptional circumstances.
In the case at hand, the applicant's counsel had requested an adjournment of the sentencing hearing on the ground that the applicant was medically unable to attend.
The respondent's counsel then sought to settle the matter of penalty by written submission.
The respondent's by-laws respecting penalty provided that the applicant shall be given the opportunity to appear and be heard.
Dismissing the application for an interim injunction,
that because the sentencing hearing was merely an extension of the disciplinary proceedings, rather than a new proceeding, the court was bound by the Appeal Court decision which held that the Court should not interfere with the proceedings of a quasi-judicial or other tribunal by interim injunction or stay except in very exceptional circumstances, which requirement, the Appeal Court had concluded, the applicant did not meet.","[0, 1, 5, 6, 4, 3, 2, 7, 10, 8]"

MORGAN, J INTRODUCTION[1] Nechapanuk Child and Family Services Inc.

[2] The appellant appeals contending that the Board exceeded its jurisdiction in making the order that it did.
Parties [2] Henry Ripplinger was the registered owner of the property which formed the subject matter of the complaint at the time the original complaint was filed.
The property was subsequently transferred by Mr. Ripplinger to HKR Collections Fine Art Limited, a company of which he is the sole director and in de facto control.
The Board added the company as a party to the proceedings.
They will be referred to collectively as the appellant in this appeal.
Background [3] This matter began in 1991.","The defendant lawyer was retained for the purpose of obtaining and disbursing mortgage funds.
The plaintiffs, creditors of the defendant's client, sued the defendant for negligent misrepresentation, breach of trust and breach of undertaking.
The defendant initially received three irrevocable letters of direction for payment of amounts owing on a construction project.
When the project got into financial difficulty the defendant advised his client to seek separate counsel to deal with the creditors - suppliers.
At a creditors meeting the defendant advised the creditors' counsel of the initial three letters of direction.
The project was considered viable by the creditors and continued, with the defendant obtaining postponements of the three letters of direction.
Further creditors' meetings were held, a Creditors' Committee struck, and subsequent letters of direction sent to the defendant by the client and certain creditors.
The defendant, in acknowledging a subsequent letter of direction, made no mention of the earlier three letters, nor any explanation of 'all of the proceeds'.
One member of the Committee was aware of the initial irrevocable letters of direction.
On what was to be the final mortgage draw, the defendant requested and was refused a postponement of the initial three letters.
With his client's consent, the defendant disbursed the funds, to pay off the initial three creditors, a mechanics' lien referred in one of the subsequent letters of direction, his legal fees and the balance as per a letter of direction received from two of three members of the Creditors' Committee.
Dismissing the action,
that (1) there was no negligent misrepresentation as the creditors had continued to advance supplies, not on the basis of the defendant's letter of acknowledgement, but because they considered the project viable.
Further, certain other plaintiffs were not aware of the letter, and could not have relied on it.
Other plaintiffs did not supply after the letter and therefore did not rely on it.
The Court noted that on a balance of probabilities, the defendant's disbursement did not cause the demise of the project.
At the time of the disbursement the project was still viable and the plaintiffs made their own decision to cease supplying and to lien the project; 
(2) there was no breach of trust as the defendant had no fiduciary duty and had at no time acted for the plaintiffs;
 and  (3) there was no breach of undertaking as the undertaking must be considered in all the circumstances, including knowledge of the plaintiffs, the other letters and meetings.
The Court concluded that the member of the Creditors' Committee who was aware of the initial irrevocable letters had a duty to advise the other members.
The documentation was clear that legal fees would be deducted and the Committee was also aware of the direction to pay the mechanics' lien.","[0, 2, 5, 1, 6, 3, 8, 9, 7, 10]"

The defendant driving a 1971 Chrysler Newport was proceeding north on 15th Avenue with the intention of turning left at 15th Street East.
He testified that he stopped at the intersection for about 15 seconds to allow several south-bound vehicles to go by, and then began his left turn.
Before he got through to the turn he saw another on-coming vehicle, this one a 1987 Ford Tempo driven by Adrianna Wormworth.
He says that he saw this vehicle for only a few seconds before the collision.
The Law 3.
Since the defendant turned across the path of the Ford Tempo, and since the two vehicles came into collision, it would appear prima facie that he failed to yield as he was required to do by Section 50(3).

The action has been abandoned as against the defendant Ruhr, and is continued by the plaintiff against the insurer, Saskatchewan Government Insurance.
Mr. Ruhr was solely liable for the accident.
The BMW was damaged as a result of the automobile accident.
The BMW was leased to the plaintiff from Crestview Chrysler Dodge Ltd. (""Crestview"") pursuant to a standard lease agreement.
Pursuant to the terms of the lease agreement, the vehicle was to be registered in the name of Crestview.
The plaintiff was listed as the ""secondary name"" on the registration.
The appraiser determined that the entire exhaust system required replacement.
SGI reassessed the claim to include damages for the replacement of the exhaust system.
However, SGI deducted from the replacement cost, 20% for depreciation or ""betterment"".
This document is normally signed by the registered owner (or owner's agent) of the vehicle.
The plaintiff brings this action for reimbursement of the $503.73 deducted for depreciation.
1978, c. A-35, as am.
(the ""Act"").
SGI denies that it elected to repair or replace the exhaust system within the meaning of statutory condition 8(4).
In addition, SGI argues that it is entitled to deduct for depreciation in any event.
Is SGI estopped from claiming that the plaintiff is responsible for the depreciation?","This was an appeal from a decision varying the appellant's maintenance downwards.
The parties had a traditional marriage, with the wife remaining at home and caring for their three children.
Upon separation, they entered into a settlement agreement whereby maintenance was set al. $2000 monthly while the appellant remained in the matrimonial home.
The agreement stipulated that the settlement was a full and final settlement on all corollary matters between the parties.
The respondent subsequently remarried, underwent some difficult financial times and made the application which was the subject of this appeal.
The appellant contended the terms of the agreement were final.
Per Jones, J.A. and Chipman, J.A. (concurring for separate reasons), allowing the appeal and setting aside the lower court order,
that while courts have ultimate jurisdiction in the matter of support, settlement agreements must be respected.
There is no difference between an agreement which provides for long term maintenance and one that does not contain such a provision.
The effect is to permanently settle the issue in both cases.
To review the agreement, particularly after the lapse of a substantial period of time, could lead to grave injustices to one or both parties.
Per Hallett, J.A., (dissenting), dismissing the appeal, that a settlement agreement which provides for periodic support payments indefinitely is very different than one which contains provisions for termination of support after a specified period.
The causal connection test established in Pelech v. Pelech (1987), 38 D.L.R. (4th) 641, should not apply to payors of periodic support for an indefinite period.
Such agreements do not have the degree of finality that was effected by the settlement agreement under consideration in the Pelech decision.","[1, 0, 10, 3, 18, 27, 34, 5, 31, 8, 17, 20, 33, 6, 40, 38, 44, 7]"

Each parent seeks the custody of Sophie on the grounds that he or she is best able to meet Sophie's needs.
Thus, the central issue is what custody arrangement would be in Sophie's best interest.
FACTSDuring the trial each parent presented volumes of evidence respecting the shortcomings of the other, all with the view of discrediting the other's ability to act as the custodial parent for Sophie.
To review all of such evidence presented during the five-day trial would be unproductive and lead to a prolix judgment.
Lorne is 33 years of age and suffers from injuries he sustained in a motor vehicle accident on February 12, 1991.
His injuries do not hinder his parenting capacity.
Tracy is 28 years of age, works 48 to 50 hours a month for a modest salary, and is dependent on social assistance.
During their cohabitation, both engaged in the consumption of alcohol and used prohibited substances.
Of those incidents, only one took place after Sophie's birth.
Tracy became pregnant in late 1992.","The applicant sought an order for certiorari quashing a decision of the trial judge granting an adjournment and a prohibition from hearing the trial.
In earlier hearings, the Crown and applicant had each sought new trial dates to ensure procurement of witnesses for trial.
The Crown sought to subpoena the victim to testify.
Due to the delay in obtaining authority to serve an out of town subpoena in New Brunswick, the Crown was unable to serve the victim until three days before trial.
The victim did not learn of the trial date until the day before and was unable to attend.
An adjournment was granted.
The applicant contended the trial judge had exceeded his jurisdiction.

It is within the jurisdiction of the trial judge to deal with the issue of adjournments in accordance with the provisions of the Criminal Code.
Jurisdictional error is not to be equated with error of law.
Any decision to grant an adjournment is therefore within the court's proper discretion.
If a remedy exists, it is by way of an appeal and not a prerogative writ.

for the respondent Board JUDGMENT KYLE J. December 12, 2002[1] This is a motion for judicial review of the decision of the Saskatchewan Labour Relations Board (""the Board"").
The Board awarded a wage increase to employees of Four Star Management Ltd., operators of certain food services at the University of Saskatchewan, Saskatoon.
The wage increase was part of a first collective bargaining agreement concluded by the Board after the normal bargaining between the parties had failed.
The governing legislative provision is s. 26.5 of The Trade Union Act, R.S.S.
1978, c. T-17 (""the Act"").
Under that provision the Board determined it would conduct a hearing to conclude all the outstanding terms of the first contract.
It required the employer to list the issues in dispute and after those issues were defined the hearing took place.
Wage issues were before the Board.
The employer had advised the Board that it was not ""prepared to make the agreement retroactive"".
As the employees were university students whose term was normally rather brief, this latter concern was of more than usual importance.
If it finds the decision unreasonable, then it considers whether that level of error reaches the patently unreasonable level.","The petitioner sought a divorce and maintenance for herself and the couple's five-year old child.

March 31, 1994 This is an appeal from a decision of the Rentalsman ordering that a writ of possession issue in respect to premises municipally described as 201 - 1st Street West in Blaine Lake, Saskatchewan.
The appellant is a tenant in residential premises owned by the respondent.
On December 28, 1993, the appellant was served with a notice to deliver up the premises described as 201 - 1st Street West, in the Town of Blaine Lake, Saskatchewan.
When this did not produce the desired result, the appellant was served with a notice of hearing to be held at the Office of the Rentalsman on February 9, 1994.
The appellant did not attend and in his absence a writ of possession was authorized in respect to the above described premises.
When this was brought to the attention of the Rentalsman the writ of possession was amended to include the second address.
This was done without notice to the appellant.
It is now argued on behalf of the appellant that the notice to vacate referred to the wrong premises as did the original writ of possession and that this deficiency vitiates the entire proceedings.","The defendants applied at the opening of the trial for dismissal alleging the plaintiffs had been misleading and had deliberately failed to disclose important information.

Rusnak for the Respondent JUDGMENT PRITCHARD J. April 16, 1999 [1] A provisional order was made by the Court of Queen's Bench for Alberta at Medicine Hat on May 13, 1998 requiring Craig Edward Holmes to pay Diane Lynn Holmes the sum of $794.00 per month as basic child support for Laurie Janay Holmes born November 1, 1983 and Christopher Holmes born November 21, 1985.
The provisional order also requires Mr. Holmes to pay an additional $75.00 per month representing 50% of the orthodontic and dental costs of the child Laurie.
The total amount owing monthly under the provisional order is $794.00.
[2] The court in Medicine Hat based its provisional order on a finding that Mr. Holmes' annual income for child support purposes was $55,000.00.
On January 22, 1999, Mr. Holmes filed a financial statement with the Court of Queen's Bench in Saskatchewan which shows his annual income for Guideline purposes to be $50,064.00 (monthly income of $4,242.00 less monthly union dues of $70.00).
Based on the Guidelines and an annual income of $50,064.00, Mr. Holmes is required to pay basic monthly maintenance of $661.00 for two children and the provisional order will be varied to reflect this amount.","The plaintiff purchased aircraft parts from the American defendant.

Shortly after the Roller Rink closed down around 9 p.m., [C.C.]
(the 12 year old girl) was sitting on a curb on 17th Street close to Carpet World and across the street from the Roller Rink yard, awaiting the arrival of her mother to pick her up.
Then the two juvenile offenders, [G.R.]
[C.S.
], jumped her she said, dragged and sexually assaulted her in that vicinity very close by.
The photographs in Exhibit P-1, while very clear, do not show clearly where the victim was accosted on the curb.
She was responsible for all the news information aired from the station in 1991.
On the morning of April 4, 1991, whoever said the news that day obtained the information from the police department on the previous night's activities.
The procedure used is to gather information down with pen on paper.
The facts have to be correct on the scripting.
The original note is then destroyed.
Once the matter has come to an end, no record of it is kept.
In this instance, the tapes were kept for eight weeks.
The employee who gathered the information from the police station is no longer with the radio station.
In this instance, Lois Holcomb said the name of the business.
""Wheel-A-While"" was used because that is the information that was received.
This was their normal practice.","A young offender was sentenced to 1 year closed custody on each of 2 armed robberies, the sentences to be consecutive to each other, but both being concurrent to the remainder of a sentence of 2 years closed custody which was already being served with respect to previous unrelated convictions when the accused escaped and committed the robberies.
18 months of the previous sentence remained to be served with the result that the total time in custody would only be increased by 6 months as a result of the 2 robbery convictions.
The Crown appealed.
HELD: Appeal allowed.
The sentence neither reflected the seriousness of the offences nor provided adequate deterrence.
The 2 new sentences totalling 2 years were made consecutive to the remaining term of 18 months as well as to each other.","[0, 1, 2, 5, 7, 8, 10, 19, 9, 17, 22, 23, 16, 20, 13, 31, 26, 32, 30, 6]"
17,"This is an appeal by the Crown against a sentence imposed upon the respondent, a young offender, as a result of his having committed two armed robberies.
He was sentenced by His Honour Judge Linton Smith to a term of one year in closed custody in respect of each of the offenses.
The two terms were ordered to be served consecutively, but concurrently with the remainder of a two year term of closed custody earlier imposed upon the respondent.
The Crown appealed on the ground the two terms of closed custody, having been ordered to be served concurrently with the earlier term, did not constitute a fit sentence having regard for the seriousness of the offenses, the requirements of deterrence, and the need to uphold public confidence in the administration of justice.
The background of the matter is this.
The respondent, now 17 1/2 years old, was in the Paul Dojack Youth Centre, serving out a two year term of closed custody for an array of offenses, when he escaped on October 18th, 1993.
On January 27th, 1994, while still at large, he and a friend held up two convenience stores in Regina while armed with a hand gun.
In each instance, the respondent wielded the weapon, said to have been a pellet gun.","The Applicant participated in a group retirement savings plan ('GRSP') created by Crown Life for its employees.
The GRSP provided for an annuity income on retirement for each participating employee.
To finance her contribution to the GRSP, she secured an interest-free loan from Crown Life and pledged her interest in the GRSP as security for the loan.
Subsequent to leaving her employment with Crown Life, she refused to repay her loan and requested that her contributions to the GRSP be transferred to another carrier.
When Crown Life refused, she applied under s.63 of the PPSA for an order declaring that Crown Life's security interest in the GRSP offended s. 146(2)(c.3) of the Income Tax Act which prohibits the taking of security in an RRSP in certain circumstances.
She also sought orders requiring Crown Life to comply with her request to transfer her contributions and restraining Crown Life from realizing on its security.
HELD: Application dismissed.
1)The terms of the GRSP and the security agreement in this case did not offend s.146(2)(c.3) of the Income Tax Act.
2)If the terms of the GRSP were breached by Crown Life, damages would be an adequate remedy.
The Applicant's request for a restraining order was therefore refused.
3)Under the terms of the GRSP contract, Crown Life was not entitled to collapse the Plan.
4)No amount was due out of the Plan to the Applicant until she retired or made a proper request for a transfer.
In this case her request for a transfer did not comply with the terms of the Plan.
There was therefore nothing to which the security interest of Crown Life could attach until a proper request for a transfer was made or until the Applicant commenced her pension.","[1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 4, 7, 8]"

No.
Counsel: Alistair B. Johnston, Q.C.
1985, c. C-46.
The Crown tendered a number of statements that were made by the deceased to several Crown witnesses concerning two previous incidents.
The second alleged incident occurred on October 17, 2003, when Michelle Lenius was again confronted by Kevin Lenius as to where she had been.
Kevin Lenius beat and then choked Michelle Lenius until she thought she was going to die.
He then sexually assaulted her.
Kevin Lenius threatened to kill Michelle Lenius if she did not drop the assault and sexual assault charges.
[2] The Crown seeks to admit the two previous incidents of choking as similar fact evidence to prove issues of motive, intent and modus operandi.
The Crown also seeks to admit several hearsay statements concerning the previous incidents of assaults and threats for the truth of their contents as being relevant to the issues of motive, intent, and modus operandi.
ISSUES1.
Are the two previous incidents of choking which occurred in August and October admissible as similar fact evidence?
Are the hearsay statements made by Michelle Lenius to her friends, family and co-workers admissible under the principled approach?
[4] Section 589 of the Criminal Code states the following:589.","FIAT The accused was charged with four counts of defamatory libel.
The alleged defamatory words were on a placard he exhibited while picketing in a public place.
He was released from custody on his consent to a term that prohibited him from picketing or carrying placards pending his trial.
He later applied for a review of the order and sought an amendment permitting him to picket lawfully.
HELD: Application dismissed.
Amendment refused.
If the accused was permitted to picket there was a substantial likelihood that he would commit another offence while on bail pending his trial on the four existing charges.
The justice granting the judicial interim release order was therefore correct to impose a complete prohibition on picketing.","[3, 1, 6, 14, 7, 25, 13, 15, 0, 19, 11, 12, 21, 16, 9]"

[2] The notice of appeal sets forth the following grounds of appeal:THIS APPEAL IS BROUGHT to have determined the following question of law: The responsibility of a representative at law for the obligations of a landlord.
The Rentalsman’s order incorrectly includes and orders the appellant, a representative of the landlord to be jointly financially responsible for this award.
The appellant was not a party to the hearing in his own name but in his capacity as a representative of the landlord and therefore has no responsibility for the financial obligations of the landlord.
We respectfully request the appellant be removed from Rentalsman’s order.

To impose an award on the appellant whose [sic] was acting not in his own right but as a representative for a landlord.
2.
To impose an award on an appellant who had not received notice that he was to be a named party at a hearing where an award could be made against him.","The respondent pled guilty in provincial court to a charge of break, enter and theft for breaking into his neighbour's house and removing lingerie from a chest of drawers in the master bedroom..

[1] At the conclusion of the hearing of this appeal, the result of the appeal was announced from the bench with brief written reasons to follow.
These are the reasons.
[2] The appeal was from an order which varied a child maintenance order.
The original order had been based on a written agreement between the parties entered into about a week before the Federal Child Support Guidelines, SOR/97-175, came into effect.
The application to vary, made about a year later, was based mainly on the coming into effect of the guidelines.
[3] The judge hearing the application to vary was faced with conflicting affidavits.
She thereupon decided not to allow evidence on all issues in dispute between the parties.
She thought that evidence was required on only three issues which she proceeded to define.
This decision gave rise to the first ground of appeal.","FIAT. The parties were divorced in 1995 and all issues including spousal maintenance were left in abeyance.
The petitioner had agreed to pay $3,000 per month which included child support but the support was reduced to $1,000 and was irregular and late.
The two children were living with the petitioner and although old enough to hold jobs, had been unable to find employment.
The petitioner's income exceeded $80,000 annually but he had been suspended with pay and the status of his employment was uncertain.
HELD: 1)It was premature to fix the amount of spousal maintenance as asked for by the applicant.
There were too many unknowns including the future of the petitioner's future job and income and how much the applicant would require should she go to university in the fall and what the children would do about future education.
2)The petitioner was not entitled to unilaterally reduce the maintenance.
3)The petitioner was directed to pay $1,500 plus $200.00 per month until the shortfall was paid in full.
 4)The applicant was awarded costs of the application.","[0, 2, 4, 6, 5, 1, 7, 9, 8, 10, 12, 11, 3]"

[2] Although not referred to in the notice of appeal, counsel argued on the appeal the question of the jurisdiction of the learned Provincial Court judge to proceed with the trial.
On a charge of theft where the value of what is alleged to have been stolen does not exceed $5,000, the Crown may in accordance with s. 334 of the Code proceed on indictment or by way of summary conviction.
Should the Crown elect to proceed by indictment, the Provincial Court has absolute jurisdiction pursuant to s. 553 of the Code.
The substantive distinction in the proceedings is therefore limited to the range of sentencing upon conviction.
On what appears to have been the first appearance of the appellant in the Provincial Court on October 15, 2001, the Court was advised that the Crown was proceeding by summary conviction.
On a subsequent appearance, the appellant entered a plea of not guilty and the case was set over for trial.
[3] The information was sworn September 27, 2001 alleging the offence to have occurred on April 27, 2000.
In these circumstances the time limitation on summary conviction proceedings imposed by s. 786(2) becomes relevant.","A decree nisi and an order granting custody to the mother was made in 1995.
Upon appeal the Court of Appeal directed a new trial.
Changes in circumstances included the fact that the child was developmentally delayed and required a special program.
A pediatrician testified that inconsistency in parenting approaches would further delay the child's development.
HELD: Custody was awarded to the father.
1)Each parent was a capable caregiver.
However, the father was available to provide full-time care due to an employment disability and exhibited a strong desire to do so.
The past physical abuse of his former spouse was not considered relevant as it did not affect his ability to parent the child.
2)The mother was to have weekly access on two non-consecutive days for eight hours and two hours on a third day.
The child was to sleep in the same bed every night.","[0, 1, 2, 5, 8, 11, 7, 12, 10, 9, 6]"

JUDGMENT ARMSTRONG J. February 4, 2000[1] This is an appeal from a decision in the Provincial Court on a Small Claim.
It involves the question of whether something that is affixed to the realty is a fixture that passes with title to the realty.
[2] In this case, respondents (third parties at trial), George David Jabour and Victoria Ann Jabour (the ""Jabours""),acquired title to a house property and caused to be affixed to the property — firmly bolted by use of anchor bolts in a concrete slab poured for that purpose — a wheelchair lift loaned to the Jabours by the Saskatchewan Abilities Council (the ""Abilities Council"") for use of their disabled foster child.
[3] The Jabours sold to Tania Kapronczai (""Tania"") then wife of the defendant, Luiz Fernando Kapronczai (""Kapronczai"").
Tania also had a disabled child.
The title was transferred to both Tania and Kapronczai.
Neither Tania nor Kapronczai made arrangements with the Abilities Council but simply took title to the house property with the wheelchair lift attached to the concrete pad and operated by electric power from the house.
[4] Then two years later Tania and Kapronczai sold the property to the respondent, Elsa San Diego (""San Diego"").","FIAT. The defendant had been held in contempt of court orders requiring that he account to the plaintiff for her trust funds.
The issue here was responsibility for the legal costs incurred by the plaintiff to compel production.
Her solicitor/client bill exceeded $50,000 including very large disbursements as a trustee was appointed to preserve the property and the defendant solicitor's files were seized.
An accountant then prepared what amounted to a forensic audit.HELD: The court was able to withdraw from further intervention.
Additional information could be obtained through the normal discovery process.
 1)The contempt was not as blatant as first appeared.
Part of his failure to produce documentation arose from the sorry state of his records and proper identification of assets was due in part to production orders against third parties.
2)The defendant solicitor ought to pay the solicitor/client costs because he caused the expense of pre-trial production by his stalling tactics.
However the appropriate route in the circumstances was to leave costs to the trial judge.
It may be that the plaintiff was indebted to the solicitor at the time of the contempt which would not excuse his failure to comply with the court order but may influence the matter of costs.
It may also be that the legal costs incurred to enforce production were out of proportion to any gain the plaintiff could have expected.","[0, 1, 3, 4, 6, 7, 8, 9, 5, 10]"

This vehicle was parked in such a manner with its lights on, one light on, and in such a position, some four to ten feet away from the travelled portion of the road, that it attracted the paramedics’ attention.
[3] The learned judge first considered whether the appellant was caught by the presumption of care and control of his vehicle pursuant to s. 258(1) of the Criminal Code, R.S.C.
[4] That was the precise situation that the ambulance attendants (and the police officer they summoned to the scene) came across when they approached the appellant’s vehicle to investigate.
[5] The learned trial judge first considered whether or not the appellant had rebutted the presumption on s. 258(1) and concluded that he had successfully done so.
He put it this way:...
And accordingly the accused, I hold, has established, by the requisite preponderance of evidence, that he did not then occupy the seat for the purpose of setting the car in motion.

was then explored by the learned trial judge in light of the evidence before him.","The applicant sought to be appointed as property guardian for his uncle pursuant to s19 of the Dependent Adults Act.
The proposed dependent adult resisted the application and attributed his previous difficulty managing his affairs to a severe drinking problem but indicated that he had not been drinking for six years.
The uncle had never been declared incompetent to manage his affairs.
He voluntarily transferred the land left to him by his father and had allowed the trust arrangement to continue since 1951.
Over the years, the land was transferred from the original trustees to various other family members and was presently registered in the name of the applicant nephew.
There was no dispute that the uncle was the beneficial owner.HELD: The land was vested directly in the name of Selwyn Hand.
The conditional stay in place pending the resolution of this application for the appointment of a property guardian was lifted. 1)The proposed dependent adult was capable of managing a significant portion of his business affairs and matters relating to his estate and property.
However he required significant independent assistance in the management of the land held for his benefit.
His suggestions and proposal to sell the land and travel were reasonable and financially modest.
2)The criteria set forth in s18 for the appointment of a property guardian was met and the Public Trustee was appointed to administer the balance of the proceeds from the land sale remaining after the uncle pursued his financial commitments and his dreams.
 3)Costs in the amount of $7,000 were to be paid to the applicant in the event the uncle chose to sell his land. 4)Any proposed sale would be subject to the approval of the Court upon application of Hand.
One half of the proceeds were to be provided directly to Hand to be dealt with as he chooses and the remaining half were to be administered by the Public Trustee in his longer term best interests according to the normal powers and procedures of that office.","[0, 1, 2, 11, 9, 7, 18, 10, 16, 5, 17, 19, 13]"

(orally)[1] This appeal against sentence must be allowed.
The offence is breach of a recognizance made under the authority of s. 810.1 of the Criminal Code, the purpose of which is to prevent further sexual offences against persons under the age of 14 years.
The breach consisted in violation of a term of the recognizance which prohibited the appellant from consuming alcohol.
The Crown admitted that there was no nexus between consumption of alcohol on the part of the appellant and his propensity to paedophilia.
In these circumstances, while we agree that a period of probation is an appropriate penalty for his offence, the inclusion of the term which prohibits him from consuming alcohol is inappropriate since it had no relation to the purpose of the original recognizance, and does not have, as far as we can see, any other purpose.","The plaintiff's leg was impaled for 25 minutes on an iron fence which he had attempted to climb for.
He was treated at the emergency department of the Victoria General Hospital for an hour.
He did not inform the doctors as to the length of time he had been impaled.
Upon his release he was advised to watch for any infection.
He was not issued antibiotics.
The wound quickly worsened, and the plaintiff was forced to undergo surgery and a skin graft to repair his leg.
He sued the doctors who initially treated him for negligence.
Dismissing the action,
that the subsequent infection was caused by the injury itself and nothing done by the defendants contributed to it in any way.
While the defendants underestimated the nature and extent of the injury, they provided a recognized method of treatment based upon the knowledge they had.
The real fault lies with the plaintiff who failed to reveal fully what had happened to him.","[0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8]"

May 12, 2003[1] This is an appeal by a tenant against a decision awarding his former landlord $1,245.00.
The appeal questions the correctness of the award and the validity of the notice of the hearing.
I need deal only with the latter.
THE FACTS[2] When the tenant vacated his rented premises there was a dispute about what constituted proper notice.
In consequence, the landlord applied to the Office of the Rentalsman for a determination of the issue.
A notice of hearing, returnable January 9, 2003, was purportedly sent to the tenant by registered mail and delivered on November 28, 2002.
This conclusion is based on a Canada Post document which states an item was delivered to the customer on November 28, 2002.
The item is not described and the customer is not named.
The document does state the item was signed for by one J. Moller Warmedal who is not the tenant.
[3] In fact, the tenant never did receive the notice.
The father appeared at the hearing and objected to the service of the notice of hearing.
[4] In her written decision the Deputy Rentalsman made these comments about service of the notice of hearing.","The parties executed a separation agreement that resolved all matters corollary to their divorce and the Matrimonial Property Act.
The respondent husband proceeded with an uncontested divorce.
The appellant wife did not oppose the proceeding.
She subsequently appealed the corollary relief judgment on the grounds that the underlying separation agreement is unconscionable and unduly harsh.
She sought to introduce fresh evidence bearing upon the circumstances leading up to the divorce.
Dismissing the appeal with costs,
that even with the new evidence, the appellant still failed to demonstrate an adequate excuse for not responding to the divorce proceeding.
There was no evidence that the appellant did not understand her legal entitlement at the time the agreements were signed, or that she did not appreciate that a divorce proceeding had been commenced.","[0, 1, 3, 4, 6, 7, 5, 8, 9, 12, 11, 10, 16, 14]"

May 15, 2003 [1] On December 2, 2002, the Honourable D.M.
Ebert, a judge of the Provincial Court of Saskatchewan, convicted the appellant (the accused) of the following offence:.
.
.
[2] The appellant appealed his conviction on following grounds:a) The learned trial Judge misdirected herself in finding, if she did so find, that the [sic] there was sufficient evidence beyond a reasonable doubt that the Appellant’s ability to operate a motor vehicle was impaired by alcohol or a drug;b) The learned trial Judge drew an incorrect inference from the facts at trial, in finding that the Appellant’s ability to operate a motor vehicle was impaired by alcohol or a drug;c) The learned trial Judge failed to give a correct legal effect to the facts that she found, including, inter alia, the lack of evidence or indicia of impairment of the Appellant, at the material time that the Appellant was found to have care or control of a motor vehicle.
JUDGMENT AT TRIAL[3] The learned trial judge delivered comprehensive reasons for judgment wherein she reviewed the applicable law and applied it to the facts as she had found them.
.
.
.
Clearly impairment of ability to drive is an issue of fact to be found on all the evidence before the Court and must satisfy the Court beyond a reasonable doubt.
His ability to make appropriate decisions with respect to driving was clearly impaired.
There is no other explanation offered for this inappropriate behaviour.","After a sub-contractor failed to complete its contract work, the plaintiff, a supplier of materials to the sub-contractor sued the general contractor and the surety under the terms of a labour and Material Payment Bond for payment of a balance owing to it by the sub-contractor.
The Bond contained a provision limiting the liability of the surety and the principal to make payment to any claimant not having a contract directly with the principal.
Dismissing the action with costs,
that there was no evidence of intention to contract, valuable consideration, or binding promise to pay between the general contractor and the supplier.
With respect to the principal, as the Bond limits the liability of the surety and principal to make payment to a claimant such as the plaintiff not having a contract directly with the principal, liability is limited by the Bond to the amount which the principal would have been obliged to pay to the plaintiff if the provisions of the Mechanics' Lien Act applied to the work.
As the contract was with the Crown, and the Act is not binding on the Crown, the general contractor was not obliged to pay anything to the plaintiff.
Therefore, the supplier was not entitled to recover against the surety under the Bond.","[0, 1, 2, 4, 6, 5, 7, 12, 10, 13, 14, 15, 3, 18, 17, 9]"

249(1)(a) of the Criminal Code, R.S.C.
1985, c. C-46.
The conviction was entered June 5, 1997, by Her Honour, Judge J.E.
McMurtry of the Provincial Court.
There are two grounds of appeal, namely:1.
The learned trial Judge erred in holding that statements made by the Appellant were not made pursuant to the Highway Traffic Act and therefore admissible in the criminal proceedings against the Appellant.
2.
During the trial, and after conducting a voir dire to determine the admissibility of certain statements made by the accused to Constable Louvel, a member of the Regina City Police Force, the learned trial judge concluded that the statement made by the accused was voluntary and admissible.
A review of the transcript reveals that the accused attended at the Regina City Police station to report an accident.
Constable Louvel had earlier received the statement of other witnesses involved in the accident.
At pp.","The applicant sought an order pursuant to s.130 of the Land Titles Act and s.56 of the Enforcement of Maintenance Orders Act for an order relieving the estate from payment of maintenance ordered in 1972.
The respondent objected to the application being brought on behalf of the estate as Olson was neither executrix nor a beneficiary under the Will.
The Will had not been admitted to probate.
The respondent had divorced testator in 1972 and was granted child support of $60 per month and monthly spousal support of $40.
The applicant who cohabited with the deceased since 1978 transferred her home to him in 1980 as joint tenants and he transferred his two and one-half quarter sections of farm land to the applicant.
The applicant suggested there was an agreement whereby the respondent lived rent free in the matrimonial home in lieu of support.
The respondent received welfare to support herself and the children and had had no funds to pursue enforcement of the unpaid support payments.
HELD: 1)The style of cause was amended to show Olson as applicant.
She was an interested party within the meaning of s.56 of the EMOA and entitled to bring the application on her own behalf.
The respondent was not misled and there was no prejudice.
2)The Land Titles Act was of no assistance to the applicant.
The application was to be determined upon s.56 of the EMOA and whether it would be grossly unfair and inequitable to refuse the application.
3)The maintenance order constitutes a charge upon the land and the applicant obtained title to the land subject to that charge.
There was no evidence presented either of consideration being paid nor of what became of the income generated by the land prior to the deceased's death.
 4)A trial of an issue was ordered to determine what if any portion of the arrears should remain a charge upon the lands.
Some of the evidence conflicted.

HELD: The appeal was dismissed with costs.
1)There was clearly no basis for adding the value of the grain on hand to the income of the respondent.
There was no indication of any underhanded or inappropriate action on the part of the respondent and the grain was to be viewed as part of his gross income in the year in which it was sold.

[1] This is an application by Beverly Brooks, Barclay Brooks and Sterling McWatters (collectively referred to as the “applicants”) for a judicial review of a decision of one of the respondents, The Saskatchewan Liquor and Gaming Licensing Commission (the “Commission”).
[2] The applicants are the owners of two horses which were involved in the race.
The horse which won (Cheetara) was disqualified for interference at the gate.
The applicants’ horses were moved up in the standings and as a result were entitled to a greater portion of the purse.
[8] After making their inquiry, the stewards disqualified Cheetara and placed Cheetara in third place.
This decision of the stewards had the effect of elevating Mafia Mamma from third place to second place.

At the time of the trial they were leading separate lives but under one roof as neither would vacate the home.
Given the respondent's age (77) the court did not want to specify a date that he had to move from the home.
He had not left the home and the matter was scheduled to be heard June19/98.
In the meantime a notice of appeal of the judgment was filed on behalf of the respondent.
At issue was the interpretation of ss(1) and (4) of s15 of the Court of Appeal Rules.
The respondent's counsel took the position that with the filing of the notice of appeal this court became functus.
The petitioner argued the order for exclusive possession is an injunction and therefore is not stayed by the notice of appeal.
Alternatively that the giving of directions as contemplated by the judgment itself would not constitute the taking of any 'execution of the judgment' or the taking of any 'further proceedings in the action' and therefore would not contravene Rule 15.

FACTSREAL is an agricultural exhibition association operating at Regina Exhibition Park in Regina, Saskatchewan.
It operates a number of facilities, including buildings suitable for short or long term commercial leases.
One of the buildings is the Jubilee Building, which was leased to FKJ Fundraising Ltd. (""FKJ"") pursuant to a lease in writing dated April 17, 1991.
The lease was for a term of five years ending August 31, 1996.
FKJ subleased the Jubilee Building to GCB for the term of the lease and REAL consented in writing to this sub-lease.
GCB used the Jubilee Building to operate a bingo hall.
It entered into written agreements with RCBA for the day to day operation of the bingos, including a further sub- lease by GCB to RCBA of the Jubilee Building.

A cardiologist appealed an order made against him by the Joint Medical Professional Review Committee for repayment of  $207,821.03 in medical fees he received over a fifteen month period from the Medical Care Insurance Branch (MCIB).
Alleged errors of law included improperly placing the burden of proof on the doctor; failing to take into account all relevant factors including the doctor's statistical analysis; considering it beyond his mandate to provide cost effective services in keeping patients out of the hospital; by using and relying on the knowledge of the Committee in preference to the expert evidence; the orders made concerning various medical services were not reasonably supported by the evidence.
The numerous grounds of appeal also included breach of the rules of natural justice by reason of a lack of institutional independence.
The application under Part 52 of the Rules of Court for a judicial review was brought to determine whether there was a reasonable apprehension of bias raised by the statutory roles of the Committee and Director or lack of institutional impartiality of the Committee or its lack of independence from the Director or MCIB.
_____
HELD: The judicial review application was dismissed.
The appeal was allowed and the repayment orders were set aside except for the orders respecting surcharges.
1)Natural justice issues: A reasonable apprehension of bias or institutional bias were not proven.
The Committee provided adequate written reasons for its decision.
The chairman refuted the allegations that the Committee heard and relied on evidence outside the presence the appellant about which he was not advised.
Neither the Director nor the Committee acted in a prosecutorial fashion.
Examples included the adjournment granted when the appellant failed to attend and the concession to his request that no cardiologist be placed on the Committee. 2)Errors of law issues:
The statistical evidence could be considered by the Committee as a prima facie case.
It was then open for it to call on the doctor to rebut the presumed departure from an acceptable pattern of medical practice.
This did not shift the overall burden of proof to the doctor nor did it require him to prove his pattern of medical practice was acceptable to the Committee.
The Committee did not err in law in misconstruing its mandate or by ignoring the statistical analysis presented by the appellant whose definition of the mandate was much narrower than envisaged by the legislation.
It was not agreed that the Committee is not bound to follow the rules of evidence and the proceedings were of an investigative nature.
The phrase 'balance of probabilities' means 'more likely than not'.
To hold otherwise would make nonsense of administrative law and would violate the rules of natural justice.
The distinction between the pattern of the doctor's billings and the pattern of his medical practice was more a matter of semantics than substance.
If economics were the only consideration the review process would be a useless exercise and the statistical comparative evidence would be conclusive of the issue.
There was no credible evidence that the members of  the Committee misused their expertise and relied on it rather than determining the issues from the evidence presented.
3)The appellant established that for the most part the decision of the Committee was not reasonably supported by but was contrary to the evidence.
The MCIB statistics were flawed as a reliable comparison tool and the appellant's adjusted statistics were more reliable even if based on estimates rather than substantiated data.
The appellant's medical practice was unique in three respects.
He did not have hospital privileges and  had staff and diagnostic equipment equivalent to a cardiac care unit in the hospital; he ordered more diagnostic tests and did more follow up than other cardiologists and had extended office hours.
4)The decision of the Committee was varied to quash all repayment orders except for $14,239.76.
The appellant admitted that many of the surcharges had been billed because of his erroneous interpretation of the tariff.
 5)Leave was granted to bring the issue of costs back for determination if necessary.","[1, 0, 8, 15, 12, 13, 11, 14, 9, 7, 5, 16, 17, 10, 21, 19, 20, 6, 4]"

Syrnick for the CrownJUDGMENT WILKINSON J.July 6, 2001[1] This is an application for orders of certiorari and mandamus concerning a decision of a Youth Court judge not to appoint counsel to represent a young person.

No.

On April 4, 2001 the young person appeared before the Youth Court judge and requested that the Court appoint him counsel after his Legal Aid lawyer withdrew.
The young person was facing a variety of charges including failure to comply with conditions of an undertaking, failure to attend court, possession of property obtained by crime and obstructing a peace officer.
The Youth Court judge was told that the young person's parents were both on social assistance and would likely be unable to provide financial assistance to him.
The young person indicated he had no resources.","FIAT. The applicant hotel was charged with five breaches of s.112(1)of the Alcohol and Gaming Act for failing to demand proof of age from minors.
The hotel was convicted on one charge and the remaining charges were held in abeyance pending its appeal.
The hotel sought an order staying the hearing scheduled by the Commission to review a decision of the Authority suspending the applicant's tavern permit for three days, pending disposal of the criminal charges.
Grounds for a stay were that the Commission's hearing would prejudice its defence on the criminal charges because it will be necessary to call similar defence evidence with respect to each proceeding; secondly, it would be manifestly unfair to have a decision for a potential penalty imposed by the Commission which may be contradictory to a finding of fact and a determination of guilt on the same facts and information before the Provicial Court.
HELD: The application was dismissed with costs.
1)The second ground raised a substantive issue and in any event was effectively disposed of by R. v. Wigglesworth.
There was nothing inconsistent with the Commission considering a form of disqualification of the applicant's license or permit, while the state exercises its criminal law power with respect to the same set of facts.
2)The applicant failed to show any prejudice to its criminal defence.
The disclosure of any defence in the Commission hearing will not result in any new facts that were not already known to the Crown.","[0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 11, 13, 12, 7, 14, 15, 16, 18, 17]"

 2)Had the plaintiff been in the mobile home he should have been suffering to some degree from carbon monoxide poisoning, he should have been coughing, his hair should have been singed, he would have had soot on his face and his clothes would have smelled of smoke. 3)The plaintiff did not call evidence to rebut the fire investigator's opinion that a significant quantity of fire accelerant had been used nor was his brother called to confirm his testimony that he attempted to re-enter the mobile home after arranging for the fire department to be called.","[0, 1, 4, 2, 6, 8, 9, 10, 12, 11, 13, 5, 15, 14]"

She also brings an application for an order fixing the amount owing under the previous child support order of Baynton J., dated September 5, 1990.
Much of the evidence herein is disputed between the parties.
I do not draw any adverse inference against the respondent for failing to produce this material.
On the evidence before me, I am of the opinion that I can determine the facts upon which to base an order.
At the time of the divorce judgment, Baynton J. ordered the respondent to pay child support for the two children, and also ordered the respondent to pay the applicant's income tax on this child support.
In each year since the judgment, the applicant has had to apply to court for an order for payment of this tax.
The respondent explains that he wanted the court to confirm the amount payable under the order and that is why he would not pay the amount voluntarily.
At the date of commencement of this application, the respondent had not paid the applicant's 1996 tax liability for the child support in the amount of $1,713.00.
However, immediately prior to this matter being heard in chambers, the respondent made the payment.","The appellant employer and the respondent union are parties to a collective agreement with effect from January 1, 1994 to December 31, 1996.
The collective agreement established employee salaries for that period, with annual adjustments on January 1st of each year.
Shortly before the agreement was signed, the Public Sector Compensation Act was passed, which rolled back and froze public sector salaries.
In a letter to the union, the employer confirmed the wage increases provided for in the agreement would be paid to the employees as a lump sum following the expiration of the legislated wage freeze.
After the expiration of the wage freeze, however, the employer refused to pay the lump sum on the grounds that it would contravene the Act.
The union sued the employer in the Supreme Court, claiming the lump sum or, in the alternative, damages for negligent misrepresentation.
The employer applied to strike the Statement of Claim on the grounds that the union's claims were within the exclusive jurisdiction of an arbitrator.
The Chambers judge dismissed the application.
The employer appealed.
Allowing the appeal and staying the action pending submission to arbitration as provided for in the collective agreement, that the Chambers judge erred in allowing the action to continue.
Where there is a doubt about the arbitrability of a dispute, that issue should generally be determined at arbitration.
This reflects the central role of arbitration in collective bargaining labour relations, recognizes that arbitration is the forum best suited to conducting the necessary inquiry, and helps ensure that no one, absent sound reasons, will be left with rights but no effective remedy.","[0, 1, 4, 3, 6, 7, 11, 14, 10, 13, 12]"

It is well settled that a substantial onus is placed upon the applicant in a Rule 173(a) motion.
The summary procedure of the Rule is only appropriate to cases which are plain and obvious.","The accused was charged with three offences under the Narcotic Control Act.
The accused contests the admissibility of marijuana plants seized by the police.
A police officer on highway patrol approaching the Manitoba border noticed a rental van with Ontario license plates stopped on the road.
The police officer stated he had no reason to believe an offence had been committed and he approached the accused to see if he required any assistance.
The officer stated it was his practice to offer assistance to motorists.
The officer asked the accused if there were any problems with the vehicle and the accused answered he was looking for a place to relieve himself.
The officer asked him where he was going and was told BC.
He then asked the accused what he had in the back of the van and was told two cases of wine.
The officer testified the accused was no longer free to go as he had believed the accused committed an offence under the Alcohol and Gaming Regulation Act.
The officer searched the vehicle without a warrant and discovered 524 marijuana plants ranging in size from three to nine inches.
HELD: The evidence is excluded.
The police officer when he pulled up to the van was not in investigative mode but pulled up to see if he could offer assistance.
The officer had no reason to suspect the accused was involved in a crime.
When he asked what was in the back of the van the officer was fishing to see what answer he got.
The Court is satisfied by the cases of Mellenthin, Young and Simpson, that if a person who has been detained cannot be asked what is in their gym bag or their pocket, how can a citizen who is not detained be asked a similar question.
The s.8 right against unreasonable search and seizure involves balancing the citizen's reasonable expectation of privacy against the states interest in law enforcement.
The police officer's question as to what was in the back of the van was unrelated to the purpose for which he had engaged the accused in conversation.
The fact is the officer was attempting to determine what was in the back of the van and searching to see what answer he would get.
The Court is satisfied the warrantless search began when the police officer asked the accused what was in the back of the van.
The onus of a warrantless search is on the crown which has not established the search was authorized by law.
The accused's right to unreasonable search and seizure was violated.
The evidence was conscriptive in that the accused was compelled to participate in the discovery of the evidence as a result of the unreasonable search which began when the officer asked what was in the back of the van.
The result is the admission of the marijuana into evidence would render the trial unfair and bring the administration of justice into disrepute unless the crown establishes that the evidence would likely have been discovered in any event.
The crown suggested no basis upon which the evidence would likely have been discovered in any event.","[0, 1, 5, 9, 13, 10, 7, 11, 12, 19, 22, 4, 17, 3]"

They lived together until February 1, 1991, when they commenced living separate and apart under the same roof.

HELD: The respondent was ordered to immediately cease all contact with TFPG clients whose account the respondent, or anyone associated with him, had administered with a view to soliciting or directing a client, affiliate or associate away from TFPG.
The restriction would not prevent a client or prospective client from engaging in any business with the respondent nor was he prevented from advertising his services.

May 24, 2007 [1] This is an application for judicial review of a Board of Arbitration Award which held that the First Nations University of Canada had violated certain provisions of a Collective Agreement in force between the parties.
The facts of the case are reasonably straightforward.
[2] On May 12, 2005, the University of Regina Faculty Association filed a grievance on behalf of Dr. Blair Stonechild who is a First Nations University faculty member.
The grievance alleged that the University had interfered with his academic freedom.
The allegation had to do with the withdrawal of an invitation to Dr. Stonechild to be the keynote speaker at a National Symposium on Post Secondary Education Policy and Funding which was held the previous month.
It was drawn into the controversy between Dr. Stonechild and the Federation in a circuitous way.","In issue was whether the Town Council's proceedings in respect to a proposed hotel development, including the bylaw, were invalid by reason of bad faith and whether it met the statutory prerequisites for a public meeting.
HELD: The Town was prohibited from holding a public hearing with respect to the amendment to the zoning bylaw and from giving third reading to and adopting the bylaw.
The application was dismissed in respect to the application for a discretionary use for a hotel development by the Palidwars. 1)The Town Council had acted openly and with candor.
It did not have a duty to inform the applicants of the proposal because they were involved in the hotel industry.
There was nothing improper about the initial confidentiality of the proposal and meetings in camera. 2)The shareholders' private interests were not being advanced rather than the community's best interest.
Section 91(2) of the Urban Municipality Act and Harker v. Regina were noted. 3)There was nothing erroneous or improper in the method used to determine the selling price. 4)The question of the sale was still open.
The Town was not subject to an unconditional commitment.
The court could not intervene as it had not been established that the Town Council had fettered its discretion.
5)The process as a whole was tainted and should be set aside.
The mayor and alderman, both shareholders and directors of the corporation, fell within the definition of partnership.
They both had a pecuniary interest in the proposal within the meaning of the legislation.
No finding was made that they acted with a dishonest or wrongful intent.
The complaint respecting a violation of s.150(e) was not established. 6)It was not necessary to determine the adequacy of the notice required by s.207 of the Planning and Development Act. 7)It was beyond the court's jurisdiction to make an order prohibiting a hearing in respect to the application for a discretionary use by the Palidwars as they were not parties to these proceedings.
The court's decision is not anticipatory in nature. 8)The applicants were awarded taxable costs of the application fixed at $400.","[4, 2, 0, 6, 3, 1, 11, 8, 5, 7, 9]"

JUDGMENT T. WHITE, PCJ JANUARY 29, 2003 [1] This is an action in negligence arising out of a vehicle accident which occurred on December 3, 2001 at Avenue “C” and Circle Drive in Saskatoon.
[2] A number of the material facts in the case are not in dispute:• a low speed collision occurred in the turning lane at this location; • a tractor (without a trailer) slowly inched up to a Honda Corrolla automobile operated by the plaintiff and nudged it causing damage to the back bumper of the Honda on the driver’s side and some slight denting on the trunk lid of the vehicle; • there was no damage to the tractor; • the driver of the tractor and his wife did not see the automobile before or at the immediate time of the collision; • the estimated cost for repairs is in the range of a thousand dollars or so and all that the plaintiff seeks is the deductible of $700 plus costs of the summons and service costs in the proceedings.
[3] The points of disagreement between the parties centered on the question of who is at fault as a matter of law for the collision and the subsequent damage.
The ultimate disagreement between the parties was over the issue of whether the defendant ought to have seen the plaintiff’s vehicle in front of him and therefore, have stopped his vehicle thus avoiding the collision.","See also 150 SaskR 185.In 1998 the Court of Appeal dismissed the applicant's sentence appeal and appeal of his 1997 convictions which consisted primarily of sexual offences involving family members and others.
The sentence of imprisonment was increased from 5 to 10 years.
The applicant, on advice of two counsel, did not initially seek leave to appeal to the Supreme Court of Canada.
He changed his mind 2 years later and sought an extension of time to apply for leave and for leave to appeal.
The applicant brought an application for release from custody pending the SCC's decision.
HELD: The application was dismissed without prejudice to reapply should leave to appeal be granted.
1)The application was premature.
The application pending before the SCC was likely to be determined within 3 to 4 months.
The Court of Appeal was not satisfied the appeal as a whole was not frivolous having regard for the requirements of s.679(3)(a) and (c).
Some grounds for appeal would clearly fail such as the ground the Court of Appeal erred in failing to give reasons for its judgment.
The new grounds of appeal were difficult to assess on the basis of the incomplete material before the court.

In addition to dissolution of the marriage she claimed custody of their children, Courtney Haley and Chelsea Haley, support for both herself and the children, an equal division of the matrimonial property and costs.
While the liability of John to pay maintenance for the children is not disputed, the parties were not fully agreed on the quantum thereof, which requires a determination of John's income.
There remains for determination the quantum of maintenance for the children, the issue of spousal maintenance and the division of matrimonial property.
BACKGROUND INFORMATION AND HISTORYMary and John were married at Antigonish, Nova Scotia, on August 30, 1975.
Mary was 18 years old at the time and John was 21.
They have been living separate and apart for approximately six years, having ceased cohabitation at the beginning of 1990.
That interrupted Mary's university education.
Mary secured employment at the Bank of Commerce in Yorkton very shortly after their arrival there.
As the parties had already started experiencing marital problems, Mary initially hesitated in following him but finally decided to do so.
are wont to be.","FIAT. The infant complainants, who alleged sexual assault and other offences, failed to identify the plaintiff, a former police officer, and a stay of proceedings was entered in 1993.
 The plaintiff commenced an action in 1994 for malicious prosecution, negligence, conspiracy and breach of Charter rights and claimed general, specific, punitive and aggravated damages, interest and costs.
 Two motions to dismiss the plaintiff's claim were brought under Queen's Bench Rules 173(a) and 188, plus Rule 173(e) in the motion brought by the two chiefs of police.
The plaintiff sought several orders in a third motion, two of which were granted summarily; one was adjourned sine die.
The applicants submitted the action should be struck, except for claims based on malice, because it was not commenced within the time prescribed by the Public Officers' Protection Act (POPA).
Referring to the 2 year and 6 year limitation periods prescribed by s.3(1)(d) and (j) of the Limitations of Actions Act (LAA), the applicants argued a retroactive order for further time was prohibited because a second limitation period had expired.
The substantive issues were whether the plaintiff's claim was barred by statutory limitation periods; whether any limitation period should be extended nunc pro tunc; whether a portion of the plaintiff's claim failed to disclose a cause of action against five of the defendants because there was no allegation of malice; whether the plaintiff's claim in tort against the Government of Saskatchewan was barred by statute.
HELD: 1)The time to bring the action was extended to September 10, 1994, retroactive to September 8, 1994.
The applications to have the action dismissed as having been commenced beyond the statutory limitation period were dismissed.
Whether the limitation period was extended was best determined at trial.
It was not certain the limitation period was not extended as the statement of claim alluded to subsequent conduct by some defendants.
As a general rule, the statutory limitation period created by s.2(1)(a) of the POPA commences to run when a stay of proceedings is entered pursuant to s.579 of the Criminal Code.
Although a stay has been entered, actionable conduct of a public officer may continue.
The only limitation period applicable in this case is s.2(1) of the POPA.
Limitation periods are substantive in character, as opposed to procedural.
The LAA does not supersede or replace s.2 of the POPA.
The intent and purpose of the LAA is to avoid conflict with other legislation by removing its application from situations specifically dealt with by other legislation.
The limitation in the POPA is not necessarily absolute.
2)The application by the chiefs of police to strike the claim in negligence was dismissed.
The position in Beckstead v. Ottawa and Reynen v. Canada was adopted.
The immunity in s.10 of the Police Act does not extend protection to police officers in general.
3)The claim in negligence against the other defendants was struck without prejudice to amend pleadings.
The pleadings as to the Crown Attorneys were struck.
They could not be saved, absent an allegation of moral turpitude implicit in malice, bad faith or improper purpose.
4)The Government's application was granted in part, such that all the claims were dismissed except those alleging conspiracy and Charter breaches.
The Crown does not enjoy absolute immunity and must bring itself within s.5(6)(a) or (b) of the Proceedings Against the Crown Act which will depend on the particular facts.
Immunity does exist for malicious prosecution and negligence.
If the decision to prosecute is protected, then the conduct in carrying out the decision should be afforded the same protection.
A claim for negligence could not be maintained against the government as employer where it was struck against the Crown Attorneys.
Leave to amend pleadings was not entertained as the plaintiff failed to give advance notice.
 5)The two applications based on Rule 188 providing for a determination of a point of law were dismissed as there was a factual component.
An order should not be granted under Rule 188 in the absence of an agreed statement of fact.
6)The plaintiff demonstrated a prima facie cause of action; provided a reasonable explanation for the delay given the circumstances and his emotional and mental state at the time; and no prejudice will flow to the defendants as they had all actively participated in the litigation from the outset.
The only reasonable course was to grant a retroactive order given the time, effort and money already expended.
It was not appropriate to require the action be commenced anew.
 7)No costs.","[1, 0, 3, 9, 7, 11, 5, 18, 10, 2, 19, 13, 28, 24]"

INTERIM CUSTODY BACKGROUND FACTS[2] By way of background, the parties began to cohabit in May of 1998.
In May of 1999, Keanna was born.
Although there is conflicting affidavit evidence with regard to the date the parties ceased to cohabit, it is somewhere in the period between October of 1999 and April of 2000.
Since the time the parties ceased to cohabit, Keanna has resided with the petitioner.
The respondent has had access.
She states that the parties had an arrangement from the outset whereby the respondent would see Keanna every second weekend and that is what happened.
[5] I have also reviewed the various affidavits of some of the family members and relatives of the parties.
[7] The surplus of the various affidavits of the parties to the applications consist of accusations and constant strife about past access arrangements.
The affidavits of the parties and their family members and relatives satisfy me that both parties are loving parents to their child.
I will also say that the mutual love and acceptance demonstrated by the families and relatives of each party, along with the overall concern for the best interests of the child, is self-evident and commendable.","The accused was charged with ten counts including robbery, aggravated assault, assault causing bodily harm, possession of stolen property and trafficking in narcotics.
She raised s.9 and 8 of the Charter in objecting to the arrest and seizure of the duffel bag.
The voir dire occupied 5 days.
HELD: 1)The four requirements set out in R. v. Feeney for a warrantless search were satisfied.
The arrest was lawful.
The search of the house and seizure of the duffel bag was incidental to the arrest and therefore lawful.
2)The accused had no expectation of privacy with respect to either her friend's residence or the bag.
The decision in R. v. Edwards was squarely on point.
There was no evidence tying the accused to the gym bag.
It was of a different description than the one used in the drugstore robbery.
The accused never asserted ownership of the bag or made any claim to any interest or right with respect to it.
The gym bag constituted non-conscriptive evidence.
3)If there were any violations of the accused's Charter rights (and it was concluded there were not) they were of a minor nature and not sufficient to engage the provisions of s.24(2) of the Charter.
To exclude the evidence would bring the administration of justice into disrepute.","[0, 1, 3, 7, 5, 6, 4, 12, 10, 15, 16, 17]"

and pursuant to s. 686(1)(a)(i) of the Criminal Code, ought to be set aside.
The appellants alleged two insufficiencies in the evidence:(i)""The absence of any expert evidence that the injuries sustained by Musam Musleh [the victim-complainant] resulted from any blows such as kicks or punches and as such were the result of an assault.""
In short, they contended that the Crown failed to prove that an offence of assault, or indeed an offence of any kind, had been committed.
(ii)""The absence of any evidence that the Appellant[s] delivered any blows to [the victim]"".
In short, they contended that the Crown failed to discharge the burden of proving identity.
As well, the appellants alleged an error of law by ""convicting .
.
.
on circumstantial evidence, when other reasonable explanations existed"".
In our respectful view the appellants failed on all three of those submissions.
In view of all of this evidence, there was sufficient evidence for the trial judge to reach a conclusion respecting the cause of the injuries beyond a reasonable doubt without resorting to medical opinion.
On the question of identity, it is true that there was no direct evidence to implicate the appellants.
There was, however, strong circumstantial evidence.","The Trustee received funds after a debtor defaulted on a consumer proposal.

The trial judge made three distinct and alternate findings: based on the evidence presented, night hunting with an artificial light is so inherently dangerous as not to attract protection as an aboriginal right; based on the Sparrow test for prima facie infringement and justification, s.11.1(3) of the Regulations withstands both prima facie infringement and justifiability scrutiny; based on the authorities, s.11.1(3) of the Regulations does not touch the appellant's core as Indians and, therefore, does not give rise to interjurisdictional immunity.
The trial judge found that aboriginal hunting rights must be exercised subject to any legislation that expresses legitimate safety concerns.
The facts were not in dispute.
The appellants, who were of Metis heritage and engaged in the traditional Metis way of life, argued they enjoy hunting rights within the meaning of s.12 of the Natural Resources Transfer Act and are exempt from any hunting prohibition when hunting on unoccupied Crown land.
The respondent acknowledged that if they are Metis, they enjoy an aboriginal right to hunt for food as protected by s.35(1) of the Constitution Act, 1982.
However, they are subject to the regulation prohibiting night hunting with artificial lights (except when hunting on a Reserve) because its primary objective is safety.
At issue was whether the appellants, as Metis, are subject to s.11.1(3)of the Saskatchewan Regulations passed pursuant to the Wildlife Act.
HELD: The appeal was dismissed.
1)The appellants failed to come within s.686(1)(a)(i) or (ii) of the Criminal Code.
2)The findings were supported by the evidence and were reasonable.
There was no wrong decision on a question of law.
 3)Aboriginal and Treaty rights are not absolute.
Reasonable regulations aimed at ensuring safety do not infringe these rights.
Laws having a safety objective do not infringe aboriginal rights.
As safety legislation, s.13.1(3) has a conservation component.
The Province has jurisdiction to pass conservation laws.
Legislation prohibiting night hunting with artificial lights has been considered by the courts of several provinces.
All courts found the practice dangerous and upheld the limiting provincial legislation. 4)The Court preferred the approach taken in R. v. Bernard, which is to consider safety as a factor in determining prima facie infringement and if necessary, justification pursuant to the Sparrow test.
The issue in this case is whether the limiting legislation is a prima facie infringement on the appellants' right to hunt for food and if so, whether it is justifiable.
Since Sparrow, it has become unnecessary and perhaps inappropriate to attempt to define aboriginal hunting rights.
Sparrow presented three questions when deciding whether there has been a prima facie infringement of hunting rights: is the limitation reasonable; does the regulation cause undue hardship; does it deny their preferred means of exercising that right.
In Seward and Bernard, the Sparrow test of infringement and justification was the only test applied.
No infringement was found in either case. 5)The trial judge concluded the practice of night hunting by means of artificial light is highly dangerous.
The prohibition was found not only to be reasonable but essential.
The regulation presented no undue hardship and was never the preferred means of hunting by people of Sapwagamik.
The legislation could not be considered a diminution of any assumed aboriginal right and there was thus no prima facie infringement of hunting rights by s.11.1(3).
 6)It was not accepted that because Reserves are exempted, safety was not the primary purpose.
Reserves were exempt out of respect for Band Council's right to pass their own safety laws pursuant to the Indian Act.
7)The trial judge correctly identified the test for justification of a legitimate regulation as being whether the legislation has a valid objective; whether the honour of the Crown is at stake; has there been as little infringement as possible; has the aboriginal group been consulted.
8)Section 11.1(3) restricts the method of hunting at night and to that extent it likely is a conservation infringement.
If so, it is still permissible provincial legislation.
It meets the Sparrow justification test because of the strong safety component.
9)Provincial hunting laws regulate aboriginal hunting rights; they do not extinguish them.
Accordingly, such laws do not cross the interjurisdictional immunity boundary.
They do not touch the core of Indians at the heart of s.91(24) of the Constitution.
The regulation applies to appellants as hunters, not as Metis.","[0, 1, 3, 7, 4, 8, 6, 18, 15, 2, 19, 20]"

This action relates to a horizontal well drilled by the parties on LSD 3 of 33-6-9-W2 (the ""Horizontal Well"" or the ""Well"").
The Horizontal Well was drilled from an existing vertical well in which Coachlight held a 65% interest and Duce held a 35% interest.
It was drilled under an operating agreement dated May 17, 1984 (the ""Operating Agreement"") which incorporates the Canadian Association of Petroleum Landmen Operating Procedures 1981 (""CAPL 1981"").
The plaintiff invoiced the defendant for its share of expenditures for the Horizontal Well but the defendant refused to pay the whole amount.
The plaintiff also seeks a declaration that it holds a builders' lien against the defendant's interest in the Well and other joint interest assets to the extent of the debts due.
The defendant denies liability for any share in the costs of the Horizontal Well in excess of $447,535.00 being 110% of the Authorization For Expenditure (""AFE"") executed with respect to the Well.

This officer testified that while investigating another matter he received word of a single vehicle roll-over accident that had taken place outside Vanscoy on Highway #7.
While continuing his investigation of the first incident, he attended at the parking lot of St. Paul’s Hospital in Saskatoon where he was approached by the accused.
[4] The officer abandoned his previous investigation.
He accompanied the accused to the triage nurse and stayed with him while the accused checked in.
During this process the officer observed symptoms of impairment and asked the accused how much he had to drink and was told that he had consumed about 15 beer.
[5] The police officer formed the opinion that he should ask the accused for a blood sample to determine the quantity of alcohol in his blood.
He therefore placed the accused under arrest for impaired operation of a motor vehicle, read him his Charter rights, the Police Warning and a Demand for Blood Sample.","An appeal from conviction and sentence for theft of an electricity generator valued at under $5,000 contrary to Criminal Code s.334(b).
On the first appearance in October, 2001, the Crown advised it would proceed by summary conviction.
The appellant pled not guilty.
Defence argued that, in the absence of evidence to the contrary, it should be inferred that the accused acquiesced or implicitly consented to proceeding by way of summary conviction.
Counsel agreed pursuant to s.786(2) to proceed by way of summary conviction and invited the court to treat the agreement as having been in place when the trial began.
Both preferred the appeal to be heard in this Court or in the Court of Appeal.
The appellant sought to have the conviction set aside on the grounds the verdict was unreasonable and not supported by the evidence; the trial judge failed to properly apply the doctrine of recent possession and did not provide adequate reasons for his decision.
HELD: The conviction appeal was dismissed.
 1)This Court had jurisdiction to entertain the appeal.
The Provincial Court judge had jurisdiction as the trial proceedings did not violate s.786(2).
2)The trial judge did not misconstrue nor misapplied the doctrine of recent possession.
The unexplained recent possession of stolen goods standing alone will permit, but not necessarily require, an inference that the possessor was the person who stole the goods.
The elements of recent possession must be strictly proven if possession is the only evidence connecting the accused with the theft.
Otherwise possession should be considered circumstantial evidence and weighed accordingly.
There was no palpable and manifest or overriding error made by the trial judge in weighing the evidence.
 3)Criminal Code s.687 appears to permit this Court to set aside the 9 month suspended sentence and to grant a conditional or absolute discharge.
However, there was no transcript of the sentencing proceedings except for a few lines.
If the transcript is not available, this Court may be reconvened to address the applicability of s.687 and whether it would be appropriate to vacate the sentence and embark on the sentencing process afresh.","[2, 3, 1, 4, 5, 8, 0, 6, 9, 11, 12, 10]"
60,"LABACH, J [1] The accused, Michael Pesenti, is charged that on or about August 9, 2009, at Saskatoon, Saskatchewan, he did:a) commit an offence under s. 254(5) of the Criminal Code and, at the time of committing the offence, knew or ought to have known, that his operation of the motor vehicle caused an accident resulting in bodily harm to another person, contrary to s. 255(2.2) of the Criminal Code; andb) operate a motor vehicle while his ability to operate the vehicle was impaired by alcohol or a drug and did thereby cause bodily harm to Neil Honatzis, contrary to s. 255(2) of the Criminal Code.
[2] He came before me for preliminary inquiry on these charges on July 26, 2010.
After the Crown had called all of their witnesses on the preliminary inquiry, I asked Defence Counsel if they had any witnesses to call on behalf of the accused.
They advised that they had one witness they wished to call but required an adjournment as that witness was not available to testify on this date.
The Crown opposed the Defence adjournment request.
It is on this request that I must now make a decision.
[3] By way of background, the accused’s charges were first before the Court on August 10, 2009 and shortly thereafter he retained Mr. Owens to represent him.
On August 19, 2009, Mr. Owens wrote to the Crown requesting full and complete disclosure.
[4] An initial disclosure package was prepared and forwarded to Defence Counsel on August 24, 2009.
[5] On August 26, 2009, Defence Counsel wrote the Crown requesting that they review his August 19th disclosure request and forward any further disclosure that had yet to be sent.

Erick Rodney Alsager (“Alsager”) was convicted of all eight offences, and the corporations under his control were convicted of five offences and two offences respectively.
The total sentence imposed by the learned trial judge was a fine of $69,000, allocated amongst the fifteen counts.
[2] Counsel for the appellants appealed this sentence on the basis that the fines were too harsh and the consecutive sentences exceed the overall capability of the offender to pay.

I ordered that the matter be remitted to Young P.C.J.
for such enquiry to be made and suspended the time for payment pending his enquiry.
[3] At that appeal, both counsel for the appellants and for the Crown agreed that the appropriate calculation for imprisonment in default of payment is prescribed by s. 734(8) of the Criminal Code.
That is, the statutory default calculations provided by s. 734(4)and (5) apply to these offences.
Thus, the default provisions in the sentences shall be varied accordingly.

When the petitioner and the respondent separated, they consented to a judgment, which granted the petitioner custody of the child and gave access rights to the respondent.
The consent judgment provided that the petitioner was to provide the respondent with 90 days notice of any proposed change in the child's residence.

for the petitionerMervin C. Phillips for the respondentJUDGMENT KYLE J. September 18, 1999[1] This action raises issues about matrimonial property and especially the matrimonial home.
[2] It may be assumed that legislatures in passing matrimonial property legislation sought to eliminate the injustice of a spouse, almost always a wife, being left in poverty by the departure of the breadwinner in whose name most of the family assets were habitually held.
In many cases she was left with nowhere to live.
[3] It may also be assumed that in making the law gender-neutral it was recognized that most often the young children of a broken home remain in the custody of the mother and so discretion was given to a judge to ameliorate the equal division regime which the registration imposed.
This has special application to the matrimonial home.

The parties were married in Mexico in October, 1964 and shortly thereafter moved to Saskatchewan.
In 1977, the family lived in Hague.
The respondent had a job operating a back-hoe.
They owned a modest home and equity in the said home of approximately $16,000.00.

Although the applicant claimed spousal maintenance in her petition, her counsel indicated she was willing to withdraw her claim if she is awarded an equal share of matrimonial property.
The parties commenced living together in April, 1978.
Two children, now ages 6 and 4, were born before they married in September, 1981.
The applicant left the matrimonial home with her children on December 6, 1982 upon discovering her husband in bed with the co-respondent .
She commenced this action a few days later.
The respondent attended the trial without counsel.
His original counsel withdrew his services shortly after the action was commenced and counsel who replaced him withdrew almost a year before the trial.
The respondent stated he had no intention of hiring yet another lawyer and was willing to conduct the trial himself.
He seemed rather uninterested in the proceeding, refusing to cross-examine any witness.
When given the opportunity to take the stand himself, he did so but once there would only express his indignation at the applicant being allowed to proceed with her claim.
He protested that he was brought to Court under false pretenses because his wife had said to him the previous spring that she thought his proposal of settlement was a pretty good idea.
Therefore, I must accept the evidence presented by the applicant as uncontested.","The Agency applied for permanent care of a young child, with no access to the parents.
Each of the mother, the biological father and the psychological father sought to have the child placed in their care.
The child had been apprehended due to unsafe and unhealthy living conditions.
The mother and psychological father no longer lived together and for the past few months, the mother had been maintaining a clean and tidy apartment and attempting to improve her education and had taken parenting courses.
The psychological father, with whom the mother had ended a tumultuous relationship, wanted the child returned to his care, stating that he planned on residing with the mother who would assist him in caring for the child.
The mother was against this plan.
The biological father only reappeared on the scene after the child was taken into care and acknowledged that the child did not know him as her father.
Child placed in the permanent care of the Agency with no access to the mother or the psychological father; access ordered to the biological father for a period of six months at which time the access order will expire automatically unless an application to vary is made; the Agency is to arrange for a parental capacity assessment of the biological father.
The child continued to be at substantial risk of physical harm due to neglect if she was returned to the mother's care and the child would be at risk of exposure to violence if returned to the psychological father's care due to the tumultuous relationship between the mother and him.
Although some improvements had recently been made in the mother's life, she had a history of frequent changes of residence and did not appear able put the child's needs ahead of her own.

The judgment incorporates the terms of an Interspousal Contract dated April 26, 1999 which provides for basic child support to be paid by Mr. Marzolf in the amount of $1,411.00 per month.
The Interspousal Contract states that the specified child support is payable for the two children of the marriage and was calculated under the Guidelines based on Mr. Marzolf’s expected annual income of $110,000.00.
The 1999 judgment was registered in that province and through her Alberta solicitor, Ms. Marzolf commenced formal negotiations in November 2002 for a retroactive upward variation of child support.
He seeks to have child support reduced for Kimberly born April 2, 1992 and entirely discontinued for Ashley born April 4, 1984.
Mr. Marzolf acknowledges that he has unilaterally terminated support for Ashley on the basis that she is over 18 years of age and not in full time attendance at school.
Ms. Marzolf has responded with her own application for variation to this court.
She seeks an upward variation of ongoing child support for Kimberly on the basis that Mr. Marzolf’s income is significantly higher than $110,000.00.
On the same basis she also seeks a retroactive variation of support paid for both girls.
Mr. Marzolf argues that these amounts should not be considered as part of his income for child support purposes.","The wife sought to have the terms of the parties' separation agreement incorporated into the corollary relief judgment following a four year marriage.
The husband sought to vary the provisions of the agreement regarding spousal and child support on the basis that the particulars of the agreement did not reflect his net business income derived from self-employment.
The husband argued that he had entered into the separation agreement (which provided for joint custody of their young child, gave the wife all of the matrimonial assets with the exception of the husband's vehicle, and provided for spousal support in the amount of $600 per month for 15 years) only as an attempt to have the wife stay in the local area with the child.
The wife had since moved with the child to New Brunswick where she was living with her parents and attending university; she was renting out the matrimonial home.
Pursuant to the current court order, she was contributing the sum of $140 per month to the husband's access costs.
Husband's current income set and child support awarded; the husband shall be responsible for 50 percent of the after tax child care costs; an additional $300 of spousal support ordered per month while the child remains in New Brunswick to address the access costs in the mother's budget; spousal support is reviewable in the event that these circumstances change, and at any rate, upon the completion of the mother's current degree; the mother shall not remove the child from the Province of New Brunswick to live in any other province without the father's consent.
Although the court could not interfere with the agreement under s. 29 of the Matrimonial Property Act, the spousal and child support geared at keeping the wife in the local area and ensuring that her needs were addressed had all changed and a new arrangement was necessary to reflect the access costs among other issues.
The wife had chosen to move away from child care services provided by the family that were practically free, as well as significant financial support and the ability to work in the furniture business with her father-in-law; she was not now pursuing a line of education which would build on her previous skills.
Her educational expenses ought not be the basis for assessing spousal support and the duration of support set out in the separation agreement far exceeded what might be imposed by a court given the years they were together and their income disparity.
The court reviewed the husband's history of income and expenses in setting his income for child support purposes.","[0, 1, 3, 5, 4, 9, 12, 13, 16, 11, 7, 10]"

The plaintiff, Barbara Cape, is the president of SEIU-West.
[2] The current collective bargaining agreement (CBA) covers the period April 1, 2008 to March 31, 2012.
A tentative agreement was reached on August 13, 2010 and ratified by the union membership on September 16, 2010.
However the formal CBA, a very lengthy and complex document, was not signed until October 25, 2010.
As the CBA provides for wage adjustments going back to April 1, 2008, it requires a substantial lump-sum adjustment payment for many of the employees.
Collective bargaining and payroll administration is carried out on behalf of the defendants by Saskatchewan Health Care Association (known as SAHO).
Understandably compiling the lump-sum retroactive payments is complex.
Many of the affected employees served in different capacities at different times for different participating employer entities at different wage scales.
The compilation of the entitlement of each affected employee is elaborate and must be done by well-trained personnel.
The parties have found this to be acceptable and it has had the approval of Canada Revenue Agency (CRA).
[3] Unfortunately a new problem has arisen with regard to the retroactive adjustment payments arising from the current CBA.","The parties, who were the parents of two children, separated after a seven year marriage.
For the five years since the separation, their parenting time with the children had been distributed on a two-week basis.

The parenting pattern followed for the past five years had been working well for the children and appeared to be serving their needs; the mother's proposal would lessen the children's time with their father and the father's proposal would also create a significant change for the children, removing their current home base.","[4, 1, 0, 3, 6, 9, 5, 8, 7, 11, 10, 14, 15]"

HELD: 1)
The petitioner's income is $73,000 versus $29,000 for the respondent.
The parties cannot agree if any of the expenses fall into s. 7 of the Guidelines as being extraordinary: $975 for child care, $500 for dance, $350 for school activities, and $1,140 for asthma medication. 2)
The court does not believe that the 'reasonable coverage' definition contained in the May 1, 2006 amendment is new law.
At best, it is a single test now enunciated in legislative form which should provide for more consistency and predictability as opposed to the many attempts to articulate a definition of extraordinary which is found in the case law.
What items claimed are necessary to attain the child's best interests and yet are reasonable given the economic circumstances of the child and her parents?
Which items might be reasonably covered by the sum of the parent's income plus child support?
2) The child care costs and asthma medication costs are of sufficient amount and peculiar to this child as to be extraordinary or not expected to be reasonably covered from the table amount of child support and the respondent's income.
 3) With respect to spousal support, neither counsel referred to the spousal support guidelines and the formula for spouses with children which measures the difference between the individual net disposable incomes of each former spouse.
These guidelines suggest that an award of between 40% to 46% of that difference in individual net disposable income be paid by the spouse with the higher INDI to the former spouse with the lower INDI.
These guidelines create a rough ballpark of $900 to $1,100 per month in this particular case.
However, the petitioner is bearing the full responsibility for family debt repayment in the interim.
In order to pay creditors in a timely fashion, the petitioner has taken this responsibility onto his shoulders.
In the circumstances, it is ordered that the petitioner pay to the respondent interim spousal support of $700.
The consequent reduction of family debt is therefore a factor of this particular interim spousal support order and should not cause confusion when addressing any property issue in the future.","[0, 1, 2, 3, 4]"

March 27, 1995This is an application for judicial review of a unanimous arbitration award by a three-person panel dated December 1, 1994 which reinstated the respondent Cumming as an employee of the applicant.
The parties, including the respondent Union had entered into a ""mutual agreement"" dated January 12, 1993 which was a back-to-work agreement for the respondent grievor following his termination as an employee on October 1, 1992.
The grievance considered by the Arbitration Board in this matter resulted from the grievor again being terminated by the employer on August 14, 1993.
The applicant takes the position that the ""mutual agreement"" was what is colloquially referred to as a ""last chance agreement"".
It states that based on this agreement and the evidence lead at the hearing, the Arbitration Board was obliged to uphold the termination.
The application raises the question of the standard of judicial review applicable to the Board's interpretation of the mutual agreement document, and to the award in general.
THE AWARDi) Facts Found By The BoardThe respondent grievor commenced his employment with the applicant on October 5, 1970.
In the year 1992 the respondent grievor and his wife divorced.","The petitioner seeks child and spousal support.
The parties signed a separation agreement and interspousal contract in July 2004.
With respect to spousal support the agreement provides that it is the intention of the parties that spousal support will be based on a division of income until July 1, 2011.HELD: 1)
The petitioner seeks a spousal support order in which the court is asked to impute income and then apply the provisions of their interspousal contract to determine quantum.
The interspousal contract does not contemplate variation of the spousal support obligation in the event of a material change of circumstance.
It will be for the trial judge to determine the intention of the parties when the agreement makes reference to the adjustments which 'will consider Technologies likely future earnings based upon whether Paul's contract is renewed with the Provincial Government'.
This is not an appropriate case in which to make an order for interim spousal support.
The petitioner is entitled to support under the agreement and in the circumstances as they presently exist.
2) With regard to child support, there is no question that Melanie remains a child of the marriage while she is attending her educational program.

HELD: 1)
The test emanating from the Controverted elections cases are not applicable.
In debates of this type, the preferred guidance is from the test articulated in Walton (Litigation Guardian of) v. Saskatchewan Hockey Association and the related cases dealing with non-profit organizations.
In those cases, the Court does not ask itself whether the results have been skewed, but rather has the organization acted in good faith and generally in accord with the concepts of natural justice?
This does not mean that there must be an exacting legal process or an application of the full 'panoply' of procedural natural justice issues.
The question is has the organization acted in a fashion that meets the legitimate expectations of a fair-minded observer?
2) No reasonable observer could conclude that the USC approached the post-vote process in good faith or in a fashion that is in harmony with the broad rules of natural justice.
When faced with a result (rendered by a procedure which it had specifically established for the referendum) which was not consistent with its wishes, the USC simply ignored its own rules and imposed its own preordained outcome.
Accordingly, the Court concluded that the USC breached its obligation to act in good faith and conducted itself in a fashion inconsistent with natural justice.
The applicant is entitled to a portion of the relief he seeks.
The referendum held by the USSU on the issue of whether it should join the CFS is of no force or effect.","[0, 1, 3, 6, 2, 7, 4, 8, 9, 5, 10, 11, 12, 13]"

Written briefs on distribution of matrimonial property to be filed by Tuesday, Nov. 9th/93.
(emphasis is mine)This motion came before me on short notice, apparently with consent of the respondent's counsel but subject to his procedural objections which I shall deal with in a moment.
Counsel for the respondent took issue with the jurisdiction of the Court to deal with the relief sought by the applicant on the ground that no formal extension of my judgment of December 3 has ever been issued.
In my opinion the law permits the court both to vary its judgment and to give directions on how the judgment should be carried out whether or not a formal order is issued by the Court.
So in my opinion I can entertain that part of the motion seeking variation of my judgment - Clause No.","The primary issue is whether the plaintiff, the owner of certain farm equipment consigned for sale at unreserved auction, has indirectly allowed another individual to bid on its behalf, or for its own benefit.
The plaintiff corporation agreed to sell its entire inventory of farm equipment at unreserved auction for a guaranteed return of $577,500.
The guarantee was given by the defendant corporate auctioneers (Ritchie).
The auction was to be conducted by the defendant corporate auctioneers (LeBlanc), a newly formed division of Ritchie.
After the auction sale was concluded, the defendant refused to pay the plaintiff the guaranteed price.
The defendant declared the guarantee unenforceable under provisions of the 'Contract to Auction' and ultimately charged the plaintiff a commission of 14% on the gross proceeds.
The defendant alleges that the plaintiff indirectly allowed another individual to bid on its behalf or for its own benefit.
HELD: 1) Clause 3.07 of the Contract to Auction prohibits an owner from bidding directly or indirectly, and from allowing any other person to bid on his behalf.
The issue here is whether the plaintiff allowed a family member to bid for the plaintiff's benefit.
A family member can be a bona fide purchaser as well as anyone else, but the nature of an unreserved auction dictate that such relationships be disclosed to the public.
The essence of the problem and the underlying purpose behind clause 3.07 is to protect bona fide bidders, and to ensure that there be no surreptitious bidding by another for the owner's benefit.
2) The plaintiff allowed Mr. Caruk to bid at the sale for the plaintiff's benefit.
It went beyond the passive act of allowing him to bid.
It actively facilitated bidding.
Mr. Caruk acknowledged he had no money to buy equipment.
The plaintiff lent him up to $100,000 for that express purpose.
It is immaterial that the loan came from Mr. Tkachuk personally rather than from the plaintiff company he controls and directs.
The plaintiff corporation benefited.
It has leased all its cattle to Mr. Caruk and the equipment will be of significant value to the fulfillment of that contract.
'For the benefit of the owner' does not have to mean for the exclusive benefit of the owner.
3) The undisclosed arrangement between Mr. Tkatchuk and Mr. Caruk gave the nephew a significant advantage at auction.
That advantage was magnified by the fact that he possessed insider information.
He knew his uncle had a guaranteed price from Ritchie's for the equipment, because that information had been imparted to him by his uncle.
All one needs to add is that Mr. Tkachuk would have profited very significantly had his arrangement with the nephew gone undiscovered.
He would have secured a guaranteed price, while procuring the commercial advantages of having his cattle lease fulfilled using equipment the nephew could not otherwise have afforded to purchase. 4)
In an area such as this where bona fides are of fundamental importance, and particularly where an owner has the advantage of a guaranteed price from the auctioneer, a deliberate non-disclosure of material information can have an impact every bit as significant as a deliberate and obvious misrepresentation.
The plaintiff should have disclosed the arrangement with Mr. Caruk to the defendants.
In not doing so, and in allowing and enabling Mr. Caruk to bid at the auction, the plaintiff breached clause 3.07.
 5) The provision for a 14% commission on the gross proceeds of sale as a consequence of breach of a fundamental term of the contract is not extravagant or unconscionable and, as the defendants pointed out, they did not elect to exercise their conjunctive right in clause 4.05 to additional amounts as liquidated damages.
The concluding paragraph would have entitled them, in addition to all other rights and remedies, to re-sell the property acquired by Mr. Caruk and to retain an amount equal to 20% of the proceeds realized.
The provision for a 14% commission on the gross proceeds of sale does not constitute a penalty. 6)
The defendants' claim solicitor and client costs pursuant to clause 4.03 of the contract.
The defendants are prima facie entitled to costs on a solicitor and client basis, but in the circumstances there are issues whether they should be restricted to one set of costs, and other issues relating to appropriate quantum.
The issue of costs will be assessed by this Court pursuant to Rule 565, with the defendants serving and filing a draft bill in the form required for a solicitor and client bill, an affidavit of disbursements, and written argument.
The plaintiff shall have 14 days to reply. 7)
The plaintiff will have a judgment against the defendants in the amount of $1,316.64 representing the power washing bill wrongfully deducted from the auction sale proceeds payable to the plaintiff.
In all other respects, the plaintiff's action is dismissed with costs.","[1, 0, 2, 4, 5, 6, 7, 9, 8, 12, 13, 16]"

IN THE COURT OF QUEEN'S BENCH JUDICIAL CENTRE OF SASKATOONBETWEEN: RICHARD ALLEN KLASSEN APPLICANT- and -HER MAJESTY THE QUEEN RESPONDENTRichard Klassen for himself W. Holmes for the CrownFIAT BAYNTON J. September 30, 1994The accused applicant applies for a review of the terms of his judicial interim release.
Although he has referred to his Charter rights in his application, he acknowledges that the required notice has not been given and that he is not seeking a Charter remedy.
He declined an adjournment to enable him to bring a Charter application and with the co-operation of the Crown, copies of the record were produced and filed with the court to enable the accused's review hearing under s. 520 of the Code to proceed.
The accused is charged with four counts of defamatory libel under ss.
300 and 301 of the Code.
He and his counsel consented to a judicial interim release order containing certain terms.
The term objected to by the accused is that he ""refrain from picketing of any kind or carrying placards of any kind"".
He seeks an amendment by adding the phrase ""regarding Sgt.
These two individuals are the complainants named in the four charges.","Immediately after the complainant accused the defendant of stealing lumber from his property and directed him to remain off the property, the defendant entered upon the complainant's property in a state of anger to challenge the complainant's authority to issue such a direction.
The complainant armed himself with a knife when the defendant entered the property, at which point the defendant grabbed a shovel, moved towards the complainant, struck him on the arm with the shovel and punched him in the ribs while he was on the ground.
The complainant suffered a fractured ulna bone and a fractured rib.
The defendant, who was charged with aggravated assault, assault by using or threatening to use a weapon and possession of a weapon, claimed to have acted in self-defence.
Defendant found guilty of all three charges; conviction entered only on the aggravated assault charge.
The actions of the complainant were justifiable as using no more force than was necessary to prevent a perceived trespass; the defendant, who was under no imminent danger, and could reasonably have retreated  upon seeing the knife, instead chose to arm himself with a shovel and strike the complainant.","[0, 1, 2, 4, 6, 3, 5, 7, 8, 9, 10, 12]"

The application is based on ss.
24(1), 7, 11(a) and 11(d) of the Charter and s. 650(3) of the Criminal Code, R.S.C.
1985, c. C-46.
The applicant argues that his constitutional rights and his right to make full answer and defence have been infringed by the refusal of the respondent to provide full and complete disclosure without trust conditions and undertakings being imposed thereon.
It is important to note that the applicant contends not for less onerous trust conditions or undertakings, but that disclosure be without trust condition or undertaking of any sort.
The Crown maintains that the trust condition or undertaking required is appropriate in the circumstances of this case.
The Crown says the seeking of the trust condition in question is an effort to ensure that sensitive material in the victims' statements and videotapes be not wrongfully used and to ensure the right to privacy of the two complainants.
The sole issue for determination by this Court is whether or not the imposition of trust conditions on the disclosure of the victims' statements prevent the accused from exercising his right to make full answer and defence as guaranteed by ss.
7 and 11 of the Charter.","The respondent applies for an order varying the custody order by changing the primary residence from the petitioner to the respondent.
HELD: 1)
The present circumstances are remarkably similar to the circumstances in Bzowey v. Bzowey, 2005 SKQB 12.
In both cases, the Court is asked to make the change based solely on the wishes of the child.
There is even evidence from the custody and access report from 2005 that the children, or at least the older child, Jill, expressed similar sentiments about living with her mother.
It cannot even be strenuously argued that the wishes of the child, Jill, have in fact changed.
Those considerations were before the Court in the form of the custody and access report when the decision was made in 2005. 2)
The Court should be loathe to make a variation order solely on the expressed wishes of a child of 11 or 12 years of age without some evidence as to why that current expression of interest has been stated.
It may well be that the child truly does wish a change.
It may also be that the child, as was referred to in the custody and access report, may be simply reflecting the views and therefore the pressures placed on the child by the non-custodial parent.
3) No evidence has been put forward about the negative impact of the continuation of the current order.
There is no information before the Court to suggest that the current situation is no longer in the best interests of the children.
No material change has been demonstrated.
The application is dismissed.","[5, 9, 8, 4, 1, 0, 7, 12, 10, 11, 6]"

DATE: DECEMBER 6, 1995The applicant (mother) seeks child support for Cassandra, born July 13, 1990.
Both she and the child are completely dependent upon the public purse.
She estimates child costs at $759.00 per month, $300.00 of which is half her rent of $600.00 per month.
The respondent (father) filed a financial statement in which he reports gross employment income of $1,213.00 per month and rental income of $410.00 per month for a total of $1,623.00 per month.
He reports expenses of $2,762.00 per month, which makes one wonder how he does it.
He gives no details about the rental income he receives nor does he identify the expense he must incur to earn this income.
I am quite sure it isn't all clear profit.
For the purpose of calculating a fair division of available resources I am going to regard his gross income as $1,400.00 per month.
Obviously there isn't enough money to go around.","Despite the court's finding of no clear winner and that both parties had contributed to the circumstances that led to the trial, the plaintiff sought costs on the basis that the defendant had refused its offer to settle.

3760 J.C.S.
The application raises a number of problems.
The plaintiff has not explained why she waited for five years after she attained majority before consulting counsel, except to say that she did not believe she could do anything as a result of the original advice she and her mother received from Judge Lavoie.
That very significant delay is a factor that I must consider, but only one.
Undoubtedly there will be some prejudice to the applicants by virtue of having destroyed their files, the death of Dr. Leakos and the diminution of memories over a period of 11 years.
Those factors must be weighed, however, against the interests of the plaintiff.
I am influenced by a number of factors.
Firstly, the notes produced from SGI of conversations with Ms. Mak, a solicitor in Judge Lavoie's office, indicate that the Lavoie firm was continuing to represent the plaintiff some six months after the initial consultation, and were preparing to file a statement of claim.
That evidence flies in the face of Judge Lavoie's statement that he refused to act.
Perhaps he was unaware Ms. Mak continued the firm's involvement.
The death of Dr. Leakos is a matter beyond the control of the parties.","The accused is charged with aggravated assault.
A voir dire was held to determine whether the accused's s. 8, s. 9, s. 10(a) and s. 10(b) Charter rights were breached.
HELD: There was no breach of the accused's Charter rights.
1) There is no evidence to establish that the accused did not speak to legal counsel.
The agreed statement of facts establishes that the accused asked to speak with Ms. Bohachik, a lawyer with Legal Aid. The police officer put the accused in contact with legal aid duty counsel instead.
When the officer told the accused that Ms. Bohachik worked with Legal Aid the accused said 'ok, Legal Aid is fine'.
The accused was put in contact with Legal Aid duty counsel.
There was no breach of the accused s. 10(b) rights.
 2) Applying the common law definition of arrest to the present situation, it is apparent that telling a person that he is no longer under arrest, without releasing him from custody, does not terminate the arrest.
It is only by ending the custody of the accused by releasing him that the arrest is ended and the accused is 'un-arrested'.
It was agreed that the officer had sufficient grounds to arrest the accused.
The arrest being legally made, it follows that the arrest continued until it was legally ended by his release.
The arrest continued throughout the search and seizure at the police station.
The Court finds that his continued detention after the purported 'un-arrest' constituted a de facto arrest.
3) There is no evidence that the accused misunderstood his actual status or that he was prejudiced by the 'un-arrest'.
The accused has not established that he was the subject of 'unreasonable search or seizure' resulting in the violation of his rights under the Charter.","[0, 1, 2, 4, 6, 5, 8, 7, 9, 11, 10, 12, 13]"

IN THE QUEEN'S BENCH(FAMILY LAW DIVISION)JUDICIAL CENTRE OF YORKTON BETWEEN:JAMES RYAN SAVENKOFFAPPLICANT (PETITIONER)- and - KATHRYN JOAN MACKAYRESPONDENT Patrick R. Koskie for the applicantDavid K. Rusnak for the respondent FIAT GUNN J. September 25, 1995 James Savenkoff (the ""applicant"") applies for an order varying the support provisions of a judgment granted by Lane J. of the Supreme Court of Ontario, on February 27, 1989, and seeks an order requiring a total payment of $570.75 per month for both children.
Kathryn Joan MacKay (the ""respondent"") opposes the application.
He also seeks an order expunging any arrears.
The relevant terms of the divorce judgment are as follows:1.
THIS COURT ORDERS AND ADJUDGES that the respondent wife shall have custody of the children of the marriage, namely, Ryan Douglas Savenkoff born October 4, 1981, and Brett James Savenkoff born April 4, 1983..
.
.
3.
(b) The respondent wife shall no longer be entitled to the petitioner husband's support upon the respondent wife obtaining full time employment or January 1, 1990, whichever occurs first.
Upon the happening of the first of the above events, the support payable by the husband shall be exclusively for the support of the infant children.","FIAT: The parties have three children, Jill born December 1981, Luke born May 1986 and Keegan born November 1989.
The respondent states that he has paid child support pursuant to the court order of February 2000 but, when the children reached the age of majority, he reduced the amount of child support payable as the children became independent and moved out on their own.
The petitioner takes issue with the respondent's unilateral reduction in child support and submits the children remained children within the meaning of the Divorce Act so long as they were attending university.
The parties agree that given the age of the children there has been a change in circumstance sufficient to allow a review of the existing child support order.
HELD: 1) The parties agree that Jill, age 26 is no longer a child of the marriage and that Luke, age 21 is not presently a child of the marriage but could once again become a child of the marriage if he attends university in the fall of 2008.
The parties also agree Keegan is 18 and remains a child of the marriage by virtue of the fact that he is taking classes at the university.
2) While the respondent asks that he be allowed to pay child support directly to the children, there is nothing in the material filed which would indicate that the petitioner is not providing support to the child in an appropriate fashion.
Further, the difficulties that would arise in respect to enforcement of the order if the child support payments were not made directly to the petitioner would mitigate against such a variation.","[0, 1, 2, 4, 6, 5, 8, 9, 3, 10, 7, 12, 13]"

DEFENDANTS (PLAINTIFFS BY COUNTERCLAIM)L. G. Greenhorn for the plaintiffs M. A. Dynna for the defendantsFIAT GEREIN J. September 30, 1994In this matter I must deal with three interlocutory applications.
The first is brought by the plaintiffs who seek an order for production of documents by the defendants.
The second and third are brought by the defendants who seek a like order in respect to the plaintiffs' documents and in addition, an order that the plaintiffs provide further and better particulars.
The personal plaintiffs guaranteed performance of that agreement.
In consequence the plaintiffs claim to be entitled to damages from the defendants on the basis of a breach of contract, intentional interference with contractual relations and breach of fiduciary relationship.
Upon being served with the statement of claim, the defendants demanded particulars and they were provided in a reply dated March 30, 1994, and amended April 21, 1994.
A statement of defence and counterclaim were served and filed.
While it is of some length, the defence essentially denies any wrongdoing.
There also is a claim for damages arising from an alleged defamation of the defendants.
They further assert that any dispute in respect to the lease was settled.
In the defence to counterclaim, para.
3 reads this way.","The eldest daughter, 15 years old, her sister, 14 years old, and their brother, 12 years old, were apprehended from their mother on 2 March 2006.
The Minister sought an order pursuant to s. 37(3) of The Child and Family Services Act placing the children in the care of the Minister until each child turned the age of 18 years.
The mother opposed the Minister's request for long term orders for the three children, taking the position that the children were not 'children in need of protection' pursuant to s. 11 of the Act, and that the children should be immediately returned to her care.
In the alternative, the mother proposed that the court make a short term supervisory order under s. 37(1)(a) of the Act, returning the children to the mother's care under supervision and conditions.
The issues were: 1) whether the children were children in need of protection pursuant to s. 11 of The Child and Family Services Act; and 2) if so, the appropriate order to be made, respecting each of the children, pursuant to s. 37 of the Act.
HELD: The children are children in need of protection pursuant to s. 11(a)(i),(v), (vi) and 11(b) of the Act.
There shall be an order pursuant to s. 37(3) of the Act that the children be placed in the custody of the Minister until each child attains the age of 18 years.
There shall also be an order with respect to access.
It is well established that child protection proceedings involve a two step process.
First, there must be a determination pursuant to s. 36(1) as to whether the child is in need of protection as that term is defined in s. 11.
If it is determined that a child is in need of protection the next step is to determine the appropriate order among the options contained in s. 37.The Ministry had a legitimate concern that, based on a prior conviction for assaulting the child of a previous common-law partner, the mother's common-law partner posed a risk to the children.
The Ministry acted appropriately by requesting the execution of a parental services agreement (PSA) with a condition therein that her partner should not have any unsupervised time with them.
The Ministry had evidence that the partner and the mother breached the terms of the PSA.
They received information from the school, neighbours, the children and, importantly, the mother herself, that the partner was having unsupervised contact with the children.
The Ministry then proceeded to apprehend the children in light of its concern regarding possible harm to the children at his hands.
The Ministry made an appropriate determination that the children were in need of protection as a result.
If the court is wrong in the determination that s. 11(a)(i) is applicable, it finds that all three children were in any event in need of protection pursuant to s. 11(v), (vi) and s. 11(b) of the Act.
The Ministry had evidence that the mother was having difficulties caring for the two children with special needs.
The mother's actions could have, and likely did, impair the development of the children.
Further, with respect to domestic violence, the mother herself characterized her relationship with the partner as emotionally abusive.
Finally, having reached conclusions that there was risk to the children, the Ministry determined that there was no other adult person able or willing to provide for the children's needs as set out in s. 11(b) of the Act.
The mother argues, in addition, that the children are no longer in need of protection.
Thus, the court has to determine whether there has been sufficient change since March 2006 so as to conclude that the children are no longer in need of protection and can immediately be returned to the mother's care.
Unfortunately, the court cannot reach that conclusion.
Indeed, the mother herself acknowledged that it would be a slow process regarding unification of the children into her home.
The mother continues to object to suggestions made by the Ministry to improve her parenting abilities.
Although the mother appears to have come some distance in understanding she has problems, she continues to resist recommendations for change.
She continues to fight the Ministry as opposed to cooperating with it.
For these reasons, and the reasons set out above, the children continue to be children in need of protection pursuant to s. 11 of the Act.
The Ministry seeks an order pursuant to s. 37(3) that the three children be placed in the custody of the Minister until each child attains the age of 18 years.
The mother says that a more appropriate order would be a short term supervisory order pursuant to s. 37(1)(a) of the Act.
All three children love their mother and want to continue to spend time with their mother.
However, they are doing extremely well in their current foster placements.
In this case, the age of the three children is a critical factor.
The children are now 15, 14 and 12 years old.
There is not much time for the mother to take all the necessary steps she needs to take before the children are returned to her and the time the children will be reaching the age of 18 years.
The Ministry has not pursued a permanent order under s. 37(2) of the Act.
Indeed, the mother and the grandmother should continue to play a substantial role in the children's lives.
An order pursuant to s. 37(3) of the Act, placing the children in the custody of the Minister until each child reaches the age of 18 years is the appropriate order in this case.
The mother will, with a long term order, have the ability to make the necessary changes in her life and, if she does so, apply for a variation of this order in the future.","[1, 0, 2, 10, 5, 6, 17, 14, 23, 16, 19, 15, 21, 24, 4]"

The respondent is now married and the petitioner is engaged to be married on May 31, 2008.
2) The petitioner seeks an order that would enable him to exercise increased access to the two young children born of his relationship with the respondent.
3) This is the second time access issues have come before the Court.
On February 1, 2007 Ryan-Froslie J. issued a fiat that specified custody and access.
At that time, the petitioner was employed by a drilling company, working every day for two weeks followed by one week off.
5) Madam Justice Ryan-Froslie also detailed very specific access provisions, setting out the exact dates and times for the petitioner's access from February 2, 2007 to April 10, 2007.

The paragraphs of the amended statement of claim at issue deal with the fact that the plaintiff alleges he was assaulted by the defendant and sustained bodily harm.
The defendant was charged with assault, but his conviction was overturned on appeal.
The issue is the effect of the acquittal in the criminal proceedings on the subsequent civil proceedings.
HELD: The paragraphs of the statement of claim at issue do not amount to an abuse of process and the application is dismissed.
1) A verdict of acquittal in a criminal trial is inadmissible in a subsequent civil trial as proof that the party did not commit the offence.
 2) In the criminal proceedings brought by the Crown against the defendant, the Crown bore the onus throughout to prove its case beyond a reasonable doubt and prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the defence of self-defence did not apply and the plaintiff did not have control of the proceedings.
In the civil proceeding, the plaintiff is in a position to control the presentation of his case and must prove his case on a balance of probabilities.

[2] In September 2004 clarification of my earlier fiat was requested and, with the consent of Mr. Brehon for the plaintiff, Ms. Ouellette for the defendants and Mr. Agnew for the board of directors of 609, the matter proceeded by conference call and written submissions.

2.
Is that counsel responsible in any way to Mr. Henry?

Can that counsel be a member of the Rask Law Firm?

Does Mr. Henry’s counsel have any right to examine Mr. Kitz (assuming for purposes of this discussion that Mr. Kitz is the proper officer to be examined on behalf of 609)?
Does the right of counsel appointed to represent 609 to question Mr. Kitz at the end of examination by the Defendants mean simply the “normal right of re‑examination” on Examination for Discovery, or does it extend further?","The municipality appealed the trial court's decision to summarily strike their claim against the province, pursuant to R14.25 of the Civil Procedure Rules (1972).
At trial, the municipality argued s. 36 of the Constitution Act compels the province to take appropriate steps to alleviate regional disparities.
Arguing this is an enforceable obligation that was breached by the province, the municipality sought a declaration from the court to that effect.
The municipality's arguments on appeal focused on the justiciability of s. 36.
The province concentrated on the fact the judge had dismissed based on deficiencies in the pleadings, calling the municipality's claim too vague to succeed.
Appeal dismissed.
The effective standard of review is correctness - whether the judge erred in law by striking the claim.
The appeal court carefully framed the issues, and examined s. 36 (its intent, and application).
Rule 14.25 is a drastic remedy, and the trial judge was aware the province had a high threshold to meet in order to have the claim struck.
While s. 36 might be justiciable, it does not provide an enforceable right to municipalities.
Rather, it embodies an agreement among federal and provincial governments, and only those parties who were privy to the agreement can act to have it enforced.
On this basis, the municipality's claim had no chance of success and the trial judge was correct to dismiss it.","[0, 1, 2, 5, 4, 7, 9, 8, 10, 11, 13, 12, 6, 15]"

Order granted, costs to the applicant in the amount of $750: assistance to be reinstated retroactively according to the time frame ordered by the appeal board.
The respondent's argument that the applicant should be required to appeal their most recent decision on eligibility must be rejected.
It would not be appropriate to require the applicant to appeal the respondent's refusal to abide by an existing appeal decision.
To allow the respondent to ignore the appeal board's ruling and request additional information effectively undermines the appeal board's authority and makes a ruling by them meaningless.
As for the other requirements for mandamus, the applicant had a legal interest in the outcome of the proceeding, the duty to him arose from the appeal board's decision, and the relevant Regulations (see Assistance Appeal Regulations, s. 14) confirm the respondent had no discretion to refuse to implement the appeal board's decision or to change the time period referenced in that decision.","[2, 3, 0, 8, 10, 4, 6, 1, 12, 7, 17]"

Dale for the respondent FIAT CURRIE J. October 5, 2005[1] On December 18, 2000 the medical review panel of the Workers’ Compensation Board of Saskatchewan decided that Brad Galger was not fit for employment.
On January 20, 2005 the Board’s appeals committee upheld a 2004 decision of the Board’s case management division that Mr. Galger was fit for employment.
[5] The Board says that, on examination of the circumstances, the decisions are not contrary to s. 64(2), and that in any event Mr. Galger must exhaust his right to appeal before seeking judicial review.
Return[6] Mr. Galger says that the return should include his counsel’s April 5, 2005 letter and the April 13, 2005 reply from the Board’s appeals committee.
He argues that the April 13, 2005 letter is a clarification of the Board’s position, and that it can be understood only by reference to the April 5, 2005 letter.
[8] The Board takes the position that the letters are neither part of the impugned decisions nor part of the record.
[9] The Board is correct.
Rule 669 requires a return that includes information up to and including the impugned decision and the reasons therefor.","FIAT: This is an application to determine interim parenting for the child, Kaira, who is 2.5 years old.
There is conflicting information about the nature and extent of the petitioner father's parenting duties.
The respondent has chosen to move to Victoria to attend school.
She applies as the primary parent to have the child go with her.
The petitioner would like Kaira to remain in Saskatchewan and have regular contact with each parent on alternating weeks.
HELD: 1) The residence status quo in this case is Regina and Kaira shall, pending trial, reside in Regina.
The Court cannot determine on conflicting affidavits what the primary parent status quo is.
2) It is in the best interest that the child see both parents.
There was a similar course in Saskatoon that the respondent could have taken which would have made more frequent changes possible, but her affidavit indicates she thinks the Saskatoon course is inferior to the one she is taking in Victoria.
3) Pending trial the child shall be parented by the petitioner for 28 days, and thereafter by the respondent for 28 days and such parenting shall continue to alternate for each 28 day period thereafter until further order.

The result favoured joining the federation.
2) The applicant applies under The Non-Profit Corporations Act, 1995, S.S. 1995, c. N-4.2 (“Act”) seeking sundry relief, the net result of which would set aside the outcome of the referendum.
5) Under the CFS constitution, any organization wishing to join it must hold a referendum in accordance with CFS rules and procedures for referenda.
This is somewhat anomalous as the USSU, as a long-standing organization, had its own rules and procedures for referenda.
The existence of two protocols for referenda would prove to be an issue as events unfolded.
6) The CFS referendum procedure required the creation of a Referendum Oversight Committee (“ROC”) which consists of two members appointed by CFS, in effect, their organizers.
7) The USC was also aware that a referendum was necessary under its own rules.
The USSU constitution, specifically Article 11, requires a referendum for the purpose of establishing or eliminating a dedicated student fee.
8) The USSU had also adopted, as part of its general governance, an elections and referenda policy.
9) In early September, 2005, the USC appointed its representatives to the ROC which held its first meeting on September 11, 2005.","The accused is faced with a 24 count indictment associated with allegations of involvement in the sale of controlled substances.
The motion, made pursuant to s. 7, 11 and 24 of the Charter of Rights is for an order that the accused 'be provided with full disclosure in a useable format'.
The motion has two components.
The first relates to the method in which disclosure has been provided, the 'useable format'.
The second is whether full disclosure that would allow the accused to provide a full answer and defence has been provided. 
The second issue is to be dealt with by a 'Laporte inventory', name for the procedure in R. v. Laporte (1993), 113 Sask. R. 34 (C.A.).HELD: 1)
There are some 30,000 to 40,000 pages of disclosure made to the defence.
In addition, there are 275 audio file, 50 video files and a large series of photos.
The defence seeks photocopies of all officers' notebooks organized by date and officer.
The basis of the defence's argument is firstly, equality of use or a level playing field should be created with respect to the provision of documents used by the Crown and, secondly, trial fairness requires the particulars of the police officers' notes be provided in the format requested.
The defence argues that if the Crown is going to be using paper copies of some documentation because it finds that use more convenient and effective, then the defence should be provide with the same paper copies to level the playing field. 2)
The defence has candidly advised that the issue surrounding the defence of a serious drug charge usually starts with the validity of the search warrant, and the information used by the police in obtaining the search is crucial, not just the information that was provided to the official issuing the warrant but any information that may have been withheld.
The affidavits in support of the search warrants in this case are easily found in the database, and cross- referencing to the police officers' notes in support of that information is available.
What is not easily available and, for the purposes of the Crown, not relatively important is the balance of the information that may have been obtained by the officer not disclosed by affidavit.
This information is often crucial for the defence.
3) In this case, given the nature of the charges, the number of police officers involved in the investigation leading up to the issuance of the warrants and cost of obtaining hard copies, the Crown should provide hard copies of the notes made by police officers in the notebooks.
It is ordered that the notebooks of those officers who will be testifying at trial are to be provided to the defence in hard copy in chronological order.
In all other respects, the nature and format of the disclosure provided to date is appropriate in that it has been provided in a reasonably accessible manner which does not detract from the right of the accused to make full answer and defence.
 4) A useful discussion of electronic disclosure and the issues involved is found in R. v. Piaskowski, 2007 MBQB 68, in which the Court reviews extensively the use of electronic disclosure as opposed to paper disclosure.","[4, 11, 1, 16, 14, 0, 12, 13, 19, 21, 5, 17]"

14/2006 Judicial Centre: Saskatoon BETWEEN:HER MAJESTY THE QUEEN, - and -BAILEY BRADLEY LONECHILD, Counsel: Paul Goldstein for the Crown William H. Roe, Q.C.
for the accused FIAT GABRIELSON J. June 26, 2007 Introduction [1] The applicant, Bailey Bradley Lonechild (the accused), brought an application for a change in venue in this matter pursuant to s. 599(1) of the Criminal Code of Canada.
The accused seeks an order granting a trial in the City of Prince Albert or such other judicial centre as the Court deems appropriate.
Crown counsel did not oppose the application for an order under s. 119(1)(q) of the Youth Criminal Justice Act, and such an order was accordingly made.
Crown counsel, however, opposed the application for a change of venue.
[3] Counsel for the accused states the application for a change of venue is brought because it is expedient to the ends of justice as a result of the following matters: 1.
Pre‑trial publicity regarding the offence; 2.
Pre‑trial publicity regarding knives and related acts of violence in Saskatoon; 3.
[4] Crown counsel’s position was that there is an age‑old tenet that the trial should take place in the location where the offence occurred.","The appellant landlord and mother appeals from a decision of the Hearing Officer of the Office of the Residential Tenancies dismissing her claim for possession.
The landlords are mother and son.
The mother lives out of province for a number of years.
She returns in summers to reside in the premises.
This year she wanted to return to her premises on a full time basis.
She found that her son had rented out a portion of the house to a Tenant and had signed a 3 year lease.
She sought an order that the Tenant vacate the premises.
The Hearing Officer found he had no jurisdiction to deal with the dispute between the two landlords.
He found he could only deal with the situation between the landlords and the tenant and found that the tenant had signed a lease in good faith and is entitled to the rights the lease affords and is entitled to remain in the premises.
HELD: There was no valid tenancy agreement.
The Act only applies to tenancy agreements and to circumstances where rental units or residential property is validly rented by a landlord to a tenant.
In the circumstances, the Hearing Officer did not have jurisdiction to deal with this dispute.
However, the Hearing Officer did err in law in determining that the tenant was entitled to the rights that the lease affords. 1)
A room in a house is a rental unit capable of being the subject of a tenancy.
2) Clearly there was no participation by both owners in entering into this lease agreement.
Mr. Koch's evidence would lead to the opposite conclusion.
There was no express consent of principal and agent.
 3) The facts as described by the Hearing Officer do not support an agency by estoppel.
This can arise where one person has acted so as to lead another to believe that he or she has authorized a third person, without any actual authority, to act on his behalf and that other person, in such belief, enters into a transaction with that third person.
The tenant here was not aware that the mother was an owner and the mother did not lead the tenant to believe that her son was authorized to act on her behalf.","[0, 4, 9, 6, 1, 7, 2, 10, 3, 11, 14]"

Mr. McLaughlan seeks both a variation in regard to his ongoing child support payments as well as rescission of arrears which have accumulated under the original child support order.
2) Mr. McLaughlan resides in British Columbia and Ms. Braun, along with the child, Desiree, resides in Saskatoon, Saskatchewan.
Mr. McLaughlan has properly proceeded under The Inter-jurisdictional Support Orders Act in light of his residence and the fact that the original order was made pursuant to provincial as opposed to federal legislation.
3) By order dated July 17, 1995, granted in the Provincial Court of Alberta, Mr. McLaughlan was ordered to pay the sum of $500 per month as and for the support of the child, Desiree, which payments were to commence on the first day of September, 1995 and continue on the first day of each and every month thereafter until further order.
4) Mr. McLaughlan has provided income tax summaries reflecting his income for the years from 1995 through to 2004.
In addition, he swore a financial statement, on February 15, 2006, wherein he sets out his current earnings.
According to the evidence filed by Mr. McLaughlan, Mr. McLaughlan is earning the gross annual sum of $45,784.","The accused was charged with angling without a license, applying for a license when prohibited and possessing fish without a license contrary to various sections of The Fisheries Act and The Fisheries Regulations.
The accused raised a Charter defence arguing that section 35 of The Fisheries Act was unconstitutional.
The issue for the trial judge was whether there was a valid ministerial order revoking the accused's license and prohibiting him from applying for or obtaining a fishing license.
A conservation officer had attempted to serve the accused with a copy of letter signed by an unknown person on behalf of the Acting Executive Director, Fish and Wildlife Branch.
The letter purported to advise the accused that due to a previous conviction his current fishing license was revoked and he was prohibited from obtaining another one.
The letter referenced a prohibition under s. 13(4) of The Fisheries Regulations.
The conversation officer testified that he opened the door of a house that he thought belonged to the accused and left the letter on a stand near the door.
The conservation officer was unable to say if the occupant heard him say anything about a license suspension or whether anyone in the house saw him place the envelope on the stand inside the door.
HELD: Section 27 of The Fisheries Act (Saskatchewan) does not give the minister the power to revoke the a license when a person contravenes the The Fisheries Regulations.
Further, the Acting Executive Director, Fish and Wildlife Branch is not a member of Executive Council as required by the definition of 'Minister' in the Act.
The letter was signed by an unknown person who clearly did not meet the definition of 'Minister.'
Finally, the letter was not served on the accused personally or via registered mail.
There was no prohibition order in effect within the meaning of section 27 of The Fisheries Act.
The accused was acquitted of all three counts.
It was unnecessary to decide the constitutional issue.","[1, 0, 3, 4, 5, 8, 9, 6, 10]"

3 (Q.B.","The parties were in a relationship for over 5 years though they never married.
The petitioner now seeks access to the respondent's daughter from an earlier relationship.
The parties' relationship was tumultuous and included some incidents of domestic violence, which the child may have been exposed to.
There are concerns regarding the interactions between the respondent's daughter and the petitioner's own children.
The petitioner must establish, firstly, that he has 'sufficient interest' to bring this application, per s. 6(1) of The Children's Law Act, 1997.
HELD: The application for access is dismissed.
In determining whether a non-family applicant is a person with a sufficient interest, the Court must consider a variety of factors including: the extent or degree of the applicant's involvement in the child's life, the duration of that involvement, the level of intimacy and the quality of the relationship between the applicant and the child, how the relationship between the applicant and the child was represented to the world, and whether the applicant provided financially for the child.
The petitioner has demonstrated that he is a person of sufficient interest; the relationship between the parties was not short and, during its lifespan, the petitioner formed a close bond with the child and was involved with her life.
The community viewed them generally as father and daughter.
However, the Court cannot conclude that requiring the child to visit the petitioner would be of any benefit to her.
This child has already had to contend with multiple 'fathers' and multiple 'siblings', many of whom have been only temporary or fleeting personalities in her life.
The confusion that this has no doubt caused her should not be further compounded by requiring her to make even more adjustments in her understanding of what 'family' means.
Access to the petitioner is not in the best interests of this child.","[0, 1, 6, 3, 8, 7, 4, 5, 9, 2]"

123, asks for a vesting order regarding a presently unsubdivided parcel of land (proposed Parcel G) located within the SW 15-37-28 W3M owned by the respondent, Neil Klein.
As part and parcel of its request for a vesting order, the School Division seeks an order directing the Registrar of Titles to register the Plan of Proposed Subdivision with respect to Parcel G and to issue a Transform Approval Certificate.
The requested relief cannot be provided unless the Court has authority to order that a subdivision of land be effected outside the requirements of The Planning and Development Act, 1983, R.S.S.
1983-84, c. P-13.1.
[2] The issue arises in a rather complex fact situation.
The property that the School Division believed it was selling to the Flads never legally existed as a separate parcel, and was in fact located within a quarter section owned by one Ronald Erker [SW 15-37-28 W3M].
[3] The parcel actually conveyed by the School Division to the Flads (Parcel F) is a cemetery formerly owned by the Episcopal Corporation of Saskatoon.","The plaintiff entered into a contract with the defendant for the sale of organic oats.
The contract between the plaintiff and defendant stipulated that the oats were to be delivered at a stipulated moisture content.
The defendant accepted the oats from the plaintiff and did not indicate any issue with the moisture content.
In turn, the defendant sold the oats to a broker for shipment to Germany.
When the oats arrived overseas, the German buyer rejected the oats saying they had heated and did not meet his required moisture content.
The defendant refused to pay the plaintiff the amount owing under the contract and argued the plaintiff had failed to meet his contractual obligation.
HELD: The contract was between the plaintiff and defendant.
The defendant accepted delivery of the oats from the plaintiff and did not object to their quality.
The evidence before the Court was that the defendant had no complaint with the moisture content of the oats at the time of delivery by the plaintiff.
There was nothing in the contract between the plaintiff and defendant that allowed the defendant to transfer the shipping acceptance risk to the plaintiff.
The resale of the oats to Germany was the defendant's responsibility and the plaintiff is not a party to the contact with the German company.
The plaintiff was awarded the balance of the contract price, plus pre-judgment interests and costs.","[6, 1, 2, 5, 0, 8, 4, 7, 3, 11, 10]"

The applicant disputes liability for the amount set out in the wage assessment and claims that he inadvertently and innocently missed the time within which to file an appeal.
He seeks to set aside the certificate, which has been registered as a judgment of this Court, on the same basis that the Court would open up a noting for default or set aside a default judgment.
The Director, on the other hand, takes the position that this Court is without jurisdiction to do what the applicant seeks and, in any event, submits that the applicant has not met the criteria necessary to trigger the exercise of the Court’s discretion.
ISSUES[2] The issues raised in this application are:(1) Does this Court have jurisdiction to set aside the Director’s certificate filed with the Court of Queen’s Bench?
(2) If so, what criteria ought to be applied in determining whether the Court should exercise its discretion in favour of setting aside the wage assessment certificate?
(3) Has the applicant satisfied the criteria?
FACTS[3] A complaint was filed by an employee with the Labour Standards Branch against her employer, the applicant.","The accused, who was charged with 21 counts under one indictment relating to events on two separate dates, applied to have the counts severed.
First, on the basis of the dates of the occurrences and, secondly, to separate the so-called 'status offences' based on a pre-existing firearm prohibition order.
It was argued the Crown had combined all the counts into one indictment to improve its evidentiary position with regard to the unproven connection of possession of the gun on the two separate dates and to be able to cross-examine the accused on the events of both days should he choose to only testify on the events of one day.
The Crown argued that expert evidence showing a match between the gun used in the shooting on the first date and that found by the arresting officers on the second date showed a temporal and continuity nexus between the two events.
The accused's  videotaped statement to the police was also a common piece of evidence to both dates.
Application for severance dismissed.
The most significant issue was the possibility of the accused being subject to cross-examination for events of both days if he chose to testify only concerning the events of one day but his position that he had no association with the gun and that it was not in his possession on either day indicated that his decision on whether to testify would most likely be the same in relation to both sets of counts and, given that there was no jury involved, there was no risk of improper inferences being drawn.
The Crown should not be limited in the presentation of its evidence through a severance of counts because of the tenuous nexus between the two events.","[3, 6, 8, 1, 0, 7, 4, 5, 9]"

Counsel then argues for a very broad interpretation of the words “transaction” or “occurrence”.
However, this is not a matter being argued in the first instance.","The accused, a member of the RCMP, was convicted after trial of assault with a weapon contrary to s. 267(1)(a).
The accused successfully appealed his conviction to the Court of Queen's Bench where a new trial was ordered.
The Queen's Bench Judge held that the trial judge's reasons were inconsistent on the whether the accused reasonably believed that he was about to be grievously harmed and that the trial judge erred by not considering the evidence of the other police officer who testified at the trial.
The Crown appealed to the Court of Appeal arguing that the summary conviction appeal judge misinterpreted the trial judge's reasons and exceeded the bounds of appellate review.
HELD: The appeal was allowed and the conviction restored.
The summary conviction appeal court judge erred in finding that the trial judge's reasons were inconsistent.
The trial judge engaged in classical alternative reasoning.
While the trial judge did not refer to all of the evidence, he did not err in failing to do so.
The trial judge grappled with the substance of the issues presented at the trial which were whether the accused had been assaulted by the complainant, whether the accused reasonably believed that he was being assaulted and whether his response was proportionate.
The trial judge based his conclusions on the whole of the evidence rather than preferring the evidence of one witness over another.
An appellate court is not entitled to overturn a verdict simply because the trial judge placed more weight on some portions of the record than others.","[0, 1, 2, 6, 8, 5, 3, 13, 12, 9, 7, 10]"

The defendant embarked upon the project, but after a time ceased the work.

HELD: The plaintiff will have judgment against the defendant in the amount of $50.
The defendant will have judgment against the plaintiff in the amount of $450 plus costs.
Fault for this accident was attributed 10% to the defendant and 90% to the plaintiff.

Howe for the defendants (plaintiffs by counterclaim)FIAT ROTHERY J. July 29, 2008[1] The parties to this action have reached an impasse on the required disclosure and seek various orders.
The defendants (plaintiffs by counterclaim) (referred to as the “defendants”) ask that the Court exercise its discretion and sever the plaintiffs’ claim between liability and damages.
The defendants also seek an order that certain paragraphs of the plaintiffs’ claim be struck.
[2] The plaintiffs and defendants by counterclaim, which includes the two principal individuals of the plaintiff corporations, shall be collectively referred to as the “plaintiffs”.
The claims and counterclaims arose as a result of one of the defendants, Mark Wolff, leaving the employ of the plaintiffs’ consulting partnership.
The plaintiffs allege that they have developed a unique application process for the SR&ED grants.
[3] The plaintiffs state that Wolff is bound by a confidentiality and non‑competition agreement with DT Consulting.
By sharing this information with the other defendants, Wolff has breached that agreement and his contract of employment.
Furthermore, the plaintiffs state Wolff owes the plaintiffs a fiduciary duty, and by competing with the plaintiffs, he has breached that duty.","The primary issue was custody of the four children and dependent upon that determination, the quantum of child support.
Matrimonial property owned at the time of separation in 1995 had been divided except for a pension and RSP.
The parties agreed to joint custody in 1996 in an interim separation agreement and the father would pay support of $693.80 per month.HELD: 1)The evidence demonstrated a breakdown of the marriage as established by s.8(2)(a) of the Divorce Act.
2)Joint custody was ordered such that the children would reside an equal amount of time in each home, alternating every two weeks.
The most important consideration was stability which was to be found in the father's home.
Only the best interests of the children must be taken into consideration as determined by the condition, means, needs and other circumstances of the children.
3)The child support payable by the father was reduced by 30 percent.
The table amount for four children based on the father's income of $45,900 was $962 per month.
The mother's income was below the level at which any support would be payable.
Where there is a significant disparity in incomes, a straight set off as suggested in Hubic and Mertler may not be appropriate in all cases.
It failed to take into account the father's more modest means and ability to pay the full table amount as well as support for four childen in his care 50 percent of the time.
The shared custody arrangement which fell within s.9 of the Federal Child Support Guidelines, did not necessarily lead to a reduction in the amount payable.
There was no evidence of increased costs. 4)The parties agreed the registered retirement savings plan and employment pension should be divided equally after liabilities were paid. 5)No costs.","[4, 5, 6, 3, 7, 0, 1, 10, 11, 12, 13]"

THE CLAIMS[3] The plaintiff, Alex Keith Morrison, and the defendant, Dwayne Walbaum, were equal partners in Dun-Rite Plumbing & Heating Ltd.
The relationship between the two shareholders broke down and in November of 1997, on the application of Mr. Morrison, Dun-Rite was ordered liquidated.
Thereafter, Mr. Walbaum carried on business as the sole shareholder of All-Rite Plumbing & Heating Ltd.[4] The main defendant in the action is Dwayne Walbaum.
The principal allegation against him is that during 1996 and 1997 while he was solely in charge of Dun-Rite Plumbing & Heating Ltd. he diverted virtually all of its assets to himself, his companies (All-Rite Plumbing & Heating Ltd. and Tamwal Investments Ltd.) and his wife, Tammy Walbaum.
The claims against the Walbaum Group constitute the majority of the claims in the 45 paragraph statement of claim.
[5] The plaintiffs claim that the other defendants were “involved” in the divestiture of assets by the Walbaum Group.
Specifically with respect to the Sims, the plaintiffs claim:29.

Dun-Rite states that Robert Sim and Rosemary Turner are liable to Dun-Rite for breach of contact and failure to pay for the renovations.","FIAT. The applicant applied for interim custody of the one child of the marriage,and in the alternative a variation in access.
The father counter applied for interim custody.
The parties agreed in 1997 that the father should have interim custody.
The mother argued that she was the parent mainly responsible for the care and upbringing of the child prior to her hospitalization for unipolar/clinical depression.
The father had been employed as a long distance trucker but now worked days in the city.
HELD: The applications for custody were dismissed.
Overnight access was granted to the mother.
1)The application ignored the consistent law which states the courts should not vary interim custody arrangements whether legal or de facto in the absence of evidence that the child(ren) are in some way at risk, or other compelling reason.
It constitutes an error in principle, and a reversible error in law to vary interim custody pending trial in the absence of evidence of risk to the child.
The non-primary care parent should proceed to final order which in this provicne means obtaining a pre-trial date for a pre-trial conference and proceed to trial if custody is not resolved at that stage.
2)The court was satisfied on the basis of a number of medical letters indicating her emotional health was stable that the child was not at risk if the mother were granted overnight access.","[0, 7, 9, 3, 8, 11, 5, 4, 14, 15, 6]"

The parties were married in January 1991 with three children and ceased to cohabit in December of 1996.
The respondent is 52 years old and unemployed.
In the past, he has been diagnosed as paranoid schizophrenic and suffering from a personality disorder but is currently, according to his physician, of sound mind.
He qualifies since 1987 for a disability pension under CPP by reason of his mental disability which provides for a basic income of $580 plus GTS rebate for a total of $630 per month.
The petitioner lives on a section of farm land which was brought into the marriage by the respondent, of which one quarter contains the matrimonial home.
The petitioner and children live in that home.
The petitioner is 39 years old and is also unemployed because she is an incomplete quadriplegic.
The farm land is rented out from which the petitioner receives rental income.
The petitioner enjoys an income of $3,400 per month while the respondent receives $630 per month.
HELD: The petitioner is ordered to pay the respondent the annual sum of $6,000 paid in monthly installments of $500.
There is no juridical reason why the petitioner should obtain the total revenue owned by the respondent particularly when he brought the land into the marriage.
In fact, fairness and equity would suggest just the opposite, at least in respect to one half of the revenue.
Accordingly, the Court makes an order on the basis of the respondent's ownership of the land rather than order payment of spousal support.","[2, 4, 3, 0, 6, 7, 5, 8, 15, 16, 9, 12, 13, 14, 17, 11]"

Blood was drawn from the complainant and her infant daughter, as well as the accused pursuant to a warrant.
The accused challenged the validity of the warrant.
He contended that a warrant could only be issued for comparison purposes with a bodily substance found in circumstances described in section 487.05(b) of the Criminal Code, which, he alleged, did not include a bodily substance created by virtue of the conception of a child.

BACKGROUND[2] The plaintiff carries on the business of oil and gas exploration and development in Saskatchewan and elsewhere in Canada.
In the course of its business the plaintiff engages contractors to drill oil and gas wells.

The respondent claimed exemption for his own house and all of the assets he had before the marriage which lasted 21 months.
HELD: The petitioner was awarded $1,945 plus costs of $5,000.
The respondent's claim was inequitable in its entirety. 1)Saskatchewan precedents suggest that neither a marriage of short duration nor prior ownership of a home or inheritance or gifts by one side of the family constituted extraordinary circumstances.
However, prior ownership by the petitioner and its occupancy by her children, the economic imbalance between the spouses and the brevity of the marriage combined to make this an 'extraordinary' case.
The home was to remain in the petitioner's name.
It was the long term family home of the petitioner and her 10 children born of a previous marriage.
Five of those children still lived with her in the home.
The respondent had a permanent job, the prospect of an inheritance, a pension and his own home with no mortgage.
2)Credit was given to the respondent for half of the debts assumed.
One-half of the accrual to his pension and his two life insurance contracts was credited to the petitioner less a 30% deduction for income tax.
The respondent's house, jointly owned with his mother, was exempt property.","[11, 5, 10, 3, 4, 22, 0, 13, 9, 29]"

March 5, 2012 [1] In early 2008, Stomp Pork Farm Ltd., a major Saskatchewan hog producer, came under creditor protection pursuant to the Companies Creditors’ Arrangement Act, R.S.C.
1985, c. C-36.
These acquisitions were financed for the respective purchasers by Farm Credit Canada (“FCC”), as primary lender, and National Bank of Canada (“National”).
There may have been other sources of acquisition funding.
FCC and National financing is secured by mortgages against the titles to the pig barns.
Within a year both corporations were in default in their loan payments and the lenders took action.
FCC gave notice of its intention to realize on its security.
National arranged for the appointment of a receiver.
Significant amongst the HTP requirements was the necessity for the producer to empty its hog barns and keep them idle for three years.
It appears that there was no reference in the HTP conditions to mortgagees.","The landowner appealed an assessment for taxation purposes to the City Board of Revision alleging it was too high.
No cross-appeal was filed by the City but the Board increased the assessment.
The City then appealed to the Saskatchewan Municipal Board Assessment Appeals Committee to ask for a further increase.
There was no-cross appeal by the owner.
The Committee concluded the Board erred, having no jurisdiction to make an increase, and restored the original value.
Leave to appeal was granted with respect to whether the Committee erred in making an order respecting issues not raised by the notice of intention to appeal; in ruling the assessed value cannot be increased where the board orders correction of errors in the assessment; if not, whether the Committee erred in jurisdiction in failing to apply s.263.2 of the Urban Municipality Act.

2) What, if any, retroactive support should be ordered in this matter?
3) What, if any, interim spousal support should be payable by the father to the mother?
[2] Dealing firstly with the issue of extraordinary expenses for education, the mother’s evidence discloses that both children, but more particularly Kody, born October 6, 1998, is in need of a specialized educational program given his current problems at school.

Mabel, mother of the plaintiff and the defendant, set aside $20,000 in a bank account.
Prior to her death, Mabel gave written instructions to the defendant to give $5,000 to each granddaughter.
The defendant claimed that the money was to be held to pay the estate's expenses and then be divided among Mabel's children.
The money was never issued to the granddaughters.
The plaintiff claims that the written instructions to the defendant constituted the establishment of a trust and that the defendant is the trustee of the money for the benefit of the granddaughters.
HELD: Plaintiff's claim dismissed with costs to the defendant to be taxed at double column 2.
An incomplete voluntary transfer will not be construed as a declaration of trust unless it appears that there is an intention to declare a trust, and not merely make a transfer.
Mabel's written instructions do not contain any words that could possibly be construed as a declaration of trust.
She intended to make monetary gifts.
The fact that the defendant did not take the necessary steps to complete the intended gifts during Mabel's lifetime does not result in that intention being converted into a declaration of trust.
As to costs, the plaintiff alleged that the defendant committed fraud and this was never withdrawn nor proven.

The Jabours, the third parties who acquired title to the house, firmly bolted a wheelchair lift loaned to them by the Abilities Council by anchor bolts in a concrete slab.
The Jabours sold to the Kapronczais who in turn sold the property 2 years later to the respondent, San Diego, but made no mention about ownership of the wheelchair lift.
The lift ceased to operate and San Diego contacted the Abilities Council which claimed ownership to the lift.
San Diego was awarded judgment for the depreciated value against Kapronczai who joined the Jabours as third parties claiming over against them for the San Diego claim.
HELD: The appeal was dismissed against the plaintiff and the third party.
1)The wheelchair lift never became part of the realty notwithstanding how it was affixed.
It was not the intention of either party that it become part of the realty.
The intention of the parties is a prime factor in determining whether something is affixed to and becomes part of the realty.
2)The manner of attaching the lift only to the concrete slab arguably showed an intention that it not be permanent and part of the property.
 3)Section 237(2) of the Land Titles Act protects a purchaser of realty against an unregistered interest in that realty.
Interest is defined in s.237(1)(a)as any estate or interest in land.
It is not intended to protect the purchaser of realty to which something is affixed that is not intended to the knowledge of the purchaser to be part of the realty.

The parties attended a pre-trial conference in May, 2008 and, to their credit, were able to reach an agreement with respect to the issue of child support for the two children.
The party’s agreement was finalized by way of a consent order dated September 26, 2008 granted by Gunn, J.
[2] The mother has filed a motion in this matter requesting an order quantifying child support arrears which she says are due and owing pursuant to the Gunn J. order of September 26, 2008.
In addition, she requests that the court determine the ongoing child support amount to be paid by the petitioner father.
During the hearing of this matter, I questioned whether this application was more in the nature of a variation of the Gunn J. order.
The mother took the position that her application was not a variation and that it was more in the nature of an accounting exercise.
[3] The September 26, 2008 child support order is complex and, in my view, allows for unfortunate ongoing conflict between the mother and father regarding the issue of child support.","A dispute arose between a landlord and a tenant about damage to the premises and whose responsibility it was to repair the damage.

The arbitration clause was a limited arbitration clause and the arbitrator did not have jurisdiction to award damages or apply the equitable principle of estoppel.
Although greater deference is shown to decisions of consensual arbitrators than to those of statutory arbitrators, consensual arbitrators are not immune from judicial review if the means of reaching the result were unreasonable.
The results reached within the arbitrator's jurisdiction were not patently unreasonable.","[5, 6, 1, 0, 7, 4, 8, 11, 3]"

Fisher for the respondentFIAT RYAN-FROSLIE J. November 15, 20051) The petitioner, Beverley Loy Aaston applies to have arrears fixed with regard to s. 7 expenses related to her daughter’s post-secondary education and in addition requests that the amount of the ongoing s. 7 expenses be specified.
In argument Ms. Aaston acknowledged that Mr. Alm has paid the amounts as ordered to date with the exception that he has not paid any s. 7 expenses since Justice Smith’s order of September 23, 2004.
Ms. Aaston had claimed for 2003/2004 s. 7 expenses with regard to her daughter, Brina.
That application was dismissed as it pre-dates Justice Wilkinson’s order of September 28, 2004.
The sole issue now before this Court is the amount to be fixed for the ongoing s. 7 expenses.
Background 2) The parties were married on August 19, 1972 and separated August 1, 1994.
On September 8, 1998 the parties were granted a judgment for divorce which included child support.
Since that time, a number of orders have been made varying the amount of that support.
These orders largely deal with the status of the children and the costs associated with their post-secondary education.","The mother sought interim custody of their 3 and 5 year olds or primary residence of the children pursuant to s.6 of the Children's Law Act.
 The father sought a declaration declining jurisdiction, or an order for joint custody.
HELD: The children had a real and substantial connection with British Columbia and evidence of their best interests was available there.
They were not habitually resident in Saskatchewan and had been here only 3 months.
They were not living with their mother with the implied consent or acquiescence of their father.
The uncontradicted evidence that the mother never had any intention to return to the matrimonial home was accepted.
The Court would have declined to exercise jurisdiction in any event pursuant to s.16 since it was more appropriate for jurisdiction to be exercised in BC.
The father was directed to forthwith file an undertaking to not disturb the status quo until court authorization has been obtained.","[0, 4, 1, 3, 6, 5, 7, 9, 11, 10, 2]"

Racine for the defendant (applicant) FIAT GEREIN, J. July 18, 2006 [1] This is an application for an order striking out the plaintiff’s claim in defamation.
I decline to grant the order.
THE APPLICATION[2] The application is brought pursuant to Queen’s Bench Rule 173 which provides: 173.
The Court may at any stage of an action order any pleading or any part thereof to be struck out, with or without leave to amend, on the ground that:(a) it discloses no reasonable cause of action or defence, as the case may be: .
.
.
(c) it is scandalous, frivolous or vexatious; .
.
.
(e) it is otherwise an abuse of the process of the Court;and may order the action to be stayed or dismissed or judgment to be entered accordingly or may grant such order as may be just.
Unless otherwise directed, the offending party shall pay double the costs to which the other party would otherwise be entitled.
The grounds in support of the application, as set out in the notice of motion, are these:1.
The Plaintiff’s Statement of Claim discloses no reasonable cause of action.","The accused, charged with fraud, brought a motion to stay the proceedings on the basis that his Charter rights had been violated by the RCMP and the Office of the Superintendent of Bankruptcy.
The accused asked the court to reconsider its decision to quash a subpoena issued to the former Superintendent of Bankruptcy on the basis of testimony presented from other witnesses after the subpoena was quashed.
Application dismissed;
the accused had not met the onus on the balance of probabilities of establishing that the former Superintendent had relevant or material evidence to offer concerning the issues raised by the Charter motions.
The subsequent testimony and documentation did not support the accused's allegations concerning the former Superintendent's motives or conduct.","[2, 4, 0, 3, 5, 7, 1, 9, 8, 10, 15, 14, 11, 13, 12, 6]"

There is conflicting affidavit evidence respecting the nature and extent of the father’s parenting duties while the parties lived together.
The mother, Lesly, says that the father, Mike, had limited involvement with the child.
Mike says he was involved in feeding, teaching and dressing Kaira and shared other parental duties.
[2] Lesly left with Kaira to go to Victoria after the separation and by consent court order returned Kaira to Saskatchewan.
There has been a further order allowing parenting time to both parents.
The parties have been unable to resolve the issues of parenting and relocation to Victoria at a pre-trial conference.
[3] Lesly has chosen to move to Victoria to attend school.
She applies as the primary parent to have the child with her.
The issues of parenting and mobility are clearly unresolved and may go to trial.
[4] Mike would like Kaira to remain in Saskatchewan and have regular contact with each parent alternating each week.","Following a four day trial, the plaintiffs were successful in the recovery of the sum of $29,150 against the defendant.
Under the usual tariff, costs would be fixed at $4,725.
The plaintiffs sought substantially increased costs on the basis that the defendant should have admitted liability at the outset rather than forcing the plaintiffs to trial.
Solicitor and client fees totaled over $21,000.
Costs fixed at $10,000 plus disbursements;
there was no obligation on the defendant to admit liability but considering the amount of legal fees incurred in relation to the amount recovered, it was appropriate to go outside the tariffs.","[2, 3, 4, 5, 0, 6, 8, 9, 7, 10, 11, 1]"

Erhardt for the respondent (plaintiff)Monte J. Sheppard for the applicant (defendant)FIAT MALONE J. October 7, 2004 [1] This is an application to set aside a noting for default and the resulting default judgment.
The main ground of the application is that the service of the statement of claim on the defendant did not comply with Rule 19(1) of The Queen’s Bench Rules.
In support of the application the defendant deposed as follows:2.
That on or about March 16, 2004 I received a registered letter containing the Statement of Claim in the within action.
3.
It was my belief and understanding that the receipt by way of registered mail of the Statement of Claim did not constitute proper service on myself as required by the Queen’s Bench Rules.
4.
As such I did not take any steps to defend the action believing that proper personal service would be made on me in due course.
(2) The primary consideration for the court in the exercise of its discretion is that the person served or to be served: (a) received notice of the document.","The plaintiff sought to recover the purchase price and repair and inspection costs of a used vehicle pursuant to the Consumer Protection Act s.57(1)(b).
Mr. Russell sold the vehicle under consignment to the plaintiff for $1,600.
The sales agreement indicated the vehicle was sold 'as is'.
The purchaser returned the vehicle the next day because of a problem with the seat belt, a vibration or pulsation from the brakes and the 'check engine soon light' had come on.
The plaintiff paid for the sensor replacement.
Triple R absorbed the other costs of repair.
The plaintiff's daughter continued to have problems with the car including with lower ball joints, exhaust system and motor mounts.
At issue was whether or not a consignee is a 'retail seller' as defined in the Consumer Protection Act.
HELD: The plaintiff was entitled to recover the $1,600 purchase price plus foreseeable damages which included costs of repairs and inspection totalling $242.35 and costs of $20 less a reduction of $1,542.35 for the 5,000 km it was driven.
1)A consignee is a retail seller within the meaning of the CPA and accordingly Triple R was deemed to have given the warranties set out in the CPA.
If the legislature had intended that consignees were not to be considered retail sellers, it would have listed them in the excluded group.
Persons may be considered retail sellers even though they have no contractual relationship to the purchaser in s.55. 2)While the plaintiff did not pay a large sum of money, he could still expect this vehicle to be safe to drive.
It was not safe and accordingly was not of acceptable quality.
The retail seller bears the burden of establishing the exceptions enumerated in the statutory warranty and failed to do so.
The vehicle was unsafe from the outset and could not be considered suitable for the purpose of providing transportation.
It was unnecessary to make a finding with respect to warranty s. 48(g) (durable for a reasonable period of time).
3)This auto was substantially unfit for all the usual purposes for which, to the knowledge of the retail seller, it was being bought and accordingly the breach was of a substantial character.
4)The plaintiff rejected the goods within a reasonable period.
The commencement of the present action was treated as the rejection of the product.
The bulk of delay was caused by the defendant's failure to pick up and look at the vehicle (and implication this would involve repair) as agreed.","[0, 1, 4, 3, 5, 2, 6, 7, 8, 9, 12]"

Q-1, for an order:(1) requiring the plaintiff to be examined by a qualified psychiatrist within thirty (30) days; and (2) requiring a report from the said psychiatrist as to whether the plaintiff is mentally competent to instruct his solicitor, which report shall be filed with the Court; and (3) staying any further proceedings in this action until a report is filed.
This application is supported by the other defendants.
[2] The background to this law suit is a decision of this Court in Brady v. The Public Trustee for Saskatchewan, Dr. David L. Keegan, et al., Q.B.G.
690/1999 which resulted in an order revoking a certificate of incompetence issued on December 18, 1998 with respect to the plaintiff, James Brady.","FIAT: By fiat of December 5, 2002, Gerein C.J. authorized the initiation of a derivative action by Dale Henry (Henry) on behalf of 609897 Saskatchewan Ltd. (609).
By fiat of May 27 2004, the Court ruled that the defendants in the action were entitled to examine for discovery a representative of 609 and that Henry was obliged to appoint counsel for 609 in the action.
In September 2004, clarification of the May 27 2004 fiat was sought.
HELD: The questions raised by the parties together with the disparate positions taken by the participants demonstrate the confusion as to the nature of the action and of a party's rights and responsibilities within the action.
The action is a derivative one in which the action by plaintiff, 609, proceeds for the benefit of 609 against those it alleges to have caused it loss or damage.
Henry is empowered and obliged to appoint counsel for 609.
Such counsel is entitled to have access to the relevant documents, records and employees for the purposes of the action.
It follows that Henry and that counsel have professional and fiduciary obligations to 609.
Henry's overall instructions to counsel should not be in conflict with the interests of 609 as Henry is obliged to advance the corporate interests in the derivative action.
As no formal motion was brought in this proceeding and the matter proceeded with all parties consenting, there shall be no order as to costs.
Henceforth, it is the plaintiff and the defendants, who have status in these proceedings, and not Henry, in his personal capacity, or the board of directors of 609.","[0, 1, 6, 4, 2, 5, 7, 9, 3]"

The plaintiff says his creditor wrongfully converted monies after a full and final settlement of his account was agreed upon.
In addition, the plaintiff seeks punitive damages for the defendant’s “high-handed and malicious behavior”.

In May, 2001 the plaintiff assigned to the defendant his future crop insurance benefits and Canadian Wheat Board payments for application on his outstanding account.

Commission is to be payable on sale at the rate of six percent on the first $100,000.00 and three percent on any sum above that.
The purchase monies are to be paid into court and applied as directed by the court.

He entered into a settlement with the owner after she complained to the Real Estate Commission but misled and did not cooperate with the Commission.
At the discipline hearing, his evidence was found not credible.
The Committee gave a written decision outlining the reasons for finding him guilty of five counts of professional misconduct, but failed to provide reasons for the sanctions imposed, which included a two year licence suspension and hearing costs of $10,000.

THE FACTS[2] The defendant represented several farmers and farming companies in suits brought against the Saskatchewan Crop Insurance Corporation (SCIC).
The plaintiff was hired to provide technical evidence as to crop losses and damages the farmers claimed resulted from the actions of SCIC.
[3] The proceedings moved slowly.
At various times the plaintiff’s officer met with the farmers and the defendant to discuss the case, the evidence and the strategies to be followed.
The hope was that the provincial agency might settle before trial.
[4] One of the farmers, Greba, paid a deposit to the defendant for remittance to the plaintiff as a down payment on the latter’s fees.
The defendant was employed by the farmers on a contingency basis, the understanding being that the clients would pay the defendant’s disbursements in any event.
[5] As the case proceeded and the plaintiff devoted more time and resources to the preparation of its reports, it became more and more worried about how it would be paid.
[6] This concern led to a meeting between the plaintiff’s officer, Hamm, and the defendant on January 25, 1993.","The accused is charged with driving without due care and attention contrary to s. 44(1) of the Highway Traffic Act.

The parties proceeded on the following agreed statement of facts:1.","The accused is charged with driving while over .08 contrary to s. 255(1) and s. 253(a) of the Criminal Code and impaired driving contrary to s. s. 253(b) and 255(1) of the Code.
HELD: The accused is not guilty on all counts.
 1) A breath test and demand should be made as soon as the officer forms the requisite grounds for making it.
Those grounds did not change between the time the accused refused to provide an ASD sample at 8:17 a.m., when the officer arrested her for impaired driving and 8:40 a.m. when the officer read the accused the breathalyzer demand.
There was no reason for the breath demand not being made forthwith.
The rights of the accused under s. 8 and s. 9 of the Charter were breached.
2) The officer did not have reasonable and probable grounds for making the breathalyzer demand.
The officer testified she gave the ASD demand to find out if the accused had alcohol in her system.
When the accused refused, the officer arrested her for impaired driving.
The officer was unsure of whether the accused had alcohol in her system when she read the accused the ASD demand and there was no new evidence gathered between 8:17 a.m. and 8:40 a.m. to justify the breath demand.
The evidence does not support a subjective honest belief on the part of the officer that the ability of the accused to operate a motor vehicle was impaired by alcohol.
As the breath sample evidence was obtained as a consequence of the breach of the s. 8 and s. 9 Charter rights of the accused, it should be excluded from evidence pursuant to s. 24(2).
 3) The accused testified that she had been drinking alcohol and was feeling the effects of the alcohol at the time she was operating the vehicle.
She said she knew the alcohol would kick in and that she was not really feeling the effects until she arrived at the police station.
She offered an explanation for her difficulty in driving testifying that she was tired.
The evidence of the officer, which was insufficient to support a belief of impairment as a prerequisite to a breath demand, cannot prove impaired driving.
There is insufficient evidence to conclude beyond a reasonable doubt that the accused's ability to drive was impaired by alcohol at the time she was driving.","[1, 0, 4, 5, 3, 10, 6, 7, 8, 11, 2, 12, 13, 15, 9]"

IN THE COURT OF QUEEN'S BENCH (FAMILY LAW DIVISION) JUDICIAL CENTRE OF SASKATOONBETWEEN: SANDRA ANNE MORSKY APPLICANT (PETITIONER) -and-WAYNE ANDREW MORSKY RESPONDENT (RESPONDENT)A. Wiebe for the petitionerE.F.A.
Merchant for the respondent FIAT HUNTER J. July 2, 1996This is an application by the respondent, Wayne Andrew Morsky, to disqualify and to remove the law firm of Robertson Stromberg from acting for the petitioner, Sandra Anne Morsky in this action.
These are the facts.
The petitioner and respondent separated on October 1, 1992.
The petitioner retained Alma Wiebe of Walker Plaxton in Saskatoon to act for her in this action.
On May 23, 1995, Karen Prisciak (""Prisciak"") of the Robertson Stromberg firm was retained to act as co-counsel for the plaintiff.
The respondent retained Jo-Ann Parker (""Parker"") of the Griffin Toews Maddigan firm in Regina to act for him in this action.
Parker conducted examinations for discovery of the petitioner in September, 1994.
Further, Parker deposes that:In my role as legal counsel for Wayne Morsky I received confidential information regarding his corporate interests and negotiations on matters relating to settlement of property, maintenance, custody and access.
.
.
.","FIAT: The parties are the parents of a son born April 10, 2003.
They are married and the family home is in Connecticut.
The respondent mother is a Canadian citizen and has returned to Canada and now resides in Laird, Saskatchewan.
The petitioner is an American citizen and continues to reside in Connecticut and brings an application under The International Child Abduction Act for an order directing the child to be returned to Connecticut.
HELD: The respondent is directed to return the child to the State of Connecticut by January 8, 2006.
 1) The child was born in Canada.
He and his mother joined his father in Connecticut one month later in May 2003.
In February 2004 the child and his mother returned to Canada for a planned one-month visit.
It is clear that the petitioner did not consent to the prolonged absence of the respondent and the child.
In about November 2004 the respondent and the child returned to Connecticut and resumed living with the petitioner.
Reconciliation was attempted.
The respondent and child left in December 2004 and have not returned.
The crystallizing moment was in March 2004 when the respondent did not return from her trip to Canada.
For the purposes of the Convention, circumstances should be examined to determine habitual residence.
At this point the parties had adopted traditional roles.
The respondent was at home raising the child and the petitioner was attending his duties in the navy.
Through their conduct the parties had evidenced a settled intention to make their home in Connecticut.
The respondent chose to unilaterally remove the child from that home.
2) The petitioner had obtained an interim order in February 2005 directing the child to be returned to Connecticut.
He also pursued his case in the Superior Court in Connecticut and on October 2005 obtained an order dissolving the marriage, directing the respondent to return the child to Connecticut and granted the petitioner sole custody.
The respondent now asks that any order directing her and the child to return should be conditional on the petitioner varying the order he obtained in October 2005, vacating the award of sole custody to the petitioner and replacing it with something in the nature of joint custody.
The conditional return order proposed by the respondent is inappropriate.
Having determined that an order for return is warranted under the Convention, it does not lie with a Saskatchewan Court to impose a revised starting point for the process of determining custody in Connecticut.
This Court's role concludes upon the determination the petitioner has made out a case for an order for return.","[1, 0, 2, 5, 6, 9, 7, 8, 11, 13, 12, 3, 14, 15, 4]"

IN THE QUEEN`S BENCH (FAMILY LAW DIVISION) JUDICIAL CENTRE OF YORKTONBETWEEN:KATHERINE ANNE FISHER PETITIONER- and -WAYNE STANLEY GERRARD RESPONDENT A. Phillips, Q.C.
There are two issues:1. determination of income for the father, a farmer who has also been employed at the Esterhazy potash mine on a full-time basis since May of 1997; and2. whether the expenses of the eldest child attending Grade XII at Western Christian College in Dauphin, Manitoba constitute extraordinary expenses for secondary school education pursuant to s. 7(1)(d) of the Guidelines.
[2] The mother currently earns $27,600 per annum from employment with a computer consulting firm.
The father`s income from 1995 to the current date is set out below.
35,185 (21,664) ?
(to July 15) (projected) [3] The father explains his reduced farm income as due to poor yields.
He has no inventory of grain on hand and all his expenses of $56,849 are purportedly for the current crop year.
He worked substantial overtime at the mine in 1998 but that ceased in July and the father says that mine production slows down in the fall and he anticipates being laid off in October.
These expenses total $1,409.81 per month and include vehicle depreciation.","Although the mother initially had sole custody of the parties' two children, they were placed in the joint custody of both parents, with primary care and control with the father, when the mother was hospitalized due to mental health disturbances.
When the children were not later returned to her care, the mother brought an application to vary the primary care arrangements, alleging that the children were not receiving suitable and appropriate parenting while in the father's care.
The father, who lived close to the maternal grandparents and relied upon them extensively for the care of the children, questioned the mother's emotional and mental health and stability.
The transfer of primary care of the children to the mother is conditional upon the fulfillment of several provisions and prohibitions, including the mother's disclosure to her mental health caregivers of any alcohol consumption and the recent harassing phone calls made by her; should the parents be unable or unwilling to cooperate with the court directives, the court will consider filing a report of neglect under the Children and Family Services Act; primary care and access will be reviewed by the court in six months time.
The children were at considerable risk if placed in the primary care of either parent; the evidence showed that the father was unable to meet the children's needs on a daily basis; in addition to his questionable parenting judgment, his regular daily drug use in circumstances where the family lived in poverty and one child had an asthmatic medical condition showed that he placed a higher priority on his relationship with marijuana than his primary responsibility as protector of his children.
Although the mother's parenting plan was well-conceived, the court questioned whether she could withstand the daily pressure of raising the children and noted her past habit of consuming alcohol while taking medication.","[0, 1, 2, 7, 6, 3, 10, 9, 11, 5, 15, 13]"

for the plaintiff (respondent)FIAT WRIGHT J.April 15, 1998[1] The endorsement in the file indicates that Mr. Justice Hrabinsky reserved his decision with respect to the hearing of this motion in conjunction with the proposed trial of the action.
Judge Hrabinsky advises, however, that he did not intend to do so and there was no impediment to the matter being reargued and disposed of by me.
Counsel are agreed that that is the appropriate course to follow.
There is considerable urgency in this matter as the trial is imminent.
[2] I advised counsel I would not have sufficient time to give reasons for my rulings on the applicant's motion because of the scheduling of a possible further pre-trial conference.
The parties will decide after my ruling if the conference is to proceed.
[3] I will deal with the various aspects of the motion as counsel did in their briefs.
The issues raised in the application are complicated and not at all clear in their implications.","Two days after the wife commenced a divorce action in Nova Scotia, the husband commenced one in Texas.
He successfully applied to have the wife's divorce petition set aside on the grounds that she had not been ordinarily resident in Nova Scotia for at least one year immediately prior to the commencement of the proceeding.
The wife applied for a stay of execution pending her appeal of this decision.
She argued irreparable harm to herself and the parties' child on the basis that if the stay was refused, she would be required to travel to take part in the Texas proceeding, leaving her law practice for an extended time and uprooting the child who was settled in school here.
She also feared that she would be found in contempt for failing to obey the Texas custody orders and be imprisoned.
Application for stay pending appeal dismissed;
the irreparable harm claimed by the appellant was entirely speculative at this point as if the Texas court did grant custody to the father, under the Child Abduction Act, a Nova Scotia court would have jurisdiction to determine the child's habitual residence and whether the appellant was wrongfully detaining him here.
Given that the Texas court would be free to continue its proceeding even if a stay was granted, until such time as the conflict of laws issue was resolved, it would be risky for the appellant not to participate in the process there.
Furthermore, the order under appeal was not one that lent itself to being stayed under Rule 62.20.","[0, 1, 2, 4, 3, 6, 7, 5, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12]"

[2] Mr.
Ms.
Harder also asked this Court to increase Mr. Harder’s contribution for her son’s hockey, golf and baseball expenses.
[3] The issues are as follows:1.
Has there been a change of circumstance since May 17, 2002 which would warrant variation of the support order?
2.
Is Jasmine a child of the marriage within the meaning of the Divorce Act?
3.
Does Mr.
Harder have an obligation to contribute to Jasmine’s riding lessons?
4.
Mr. Harder’s income for child support purposes.
5.
Should Sloane’s s. 7 expenses (hockey, golf and baseball) be increased?
6.
Costs.
FACTS[4] The facts are not in dispute.
[5] The parties were married on June 14, 1980 and separated in 1998.
Mr.
Jasmine turned 18 on November 10, 2002.","The parties, divorced, had children, aged 23, 19, and 14 years, respectively.
The wife applied to vary the Corollary Relief Judgment (CRJ) following the termination of spousal support.
The termination had occurred pursuant to the terms of the CRJ which provided that support would terminate either twelve months after her graduation from the M.B.A. program in which she was enrolled, six months after she withdrew from the program, or when she found employment.
The wife had graduated from the program later than expected and a further six months after her course work was completed.
Both parties applied to vary child support.
The oldest child had completed his first university degree and was currently attending law school.
Pursuant to the father's employment, until the completion of their first degree, the children qualified for a program which reimbursed the father for 75 per cent of the child's educational expenses.
The CRJ had provided that the father's responsibility to pay all of the oldest child's educational expenses was conditional upon compliance and eligibility for the education reimbursement policies.
The middle child was attending university and lived in the wife's home over the summer months.
Spousal support application denied; given the family history of an emphasis on education and the oldest child's career plans and apparent aptitudes, he remained a child of the marriage; the father is to pay $10,000 per year directly to the oldest child for the next two years.
The father will pay 25 per cent of the core university costs which are not covered by the plan for the middle child as well as the difference in the Table amount of support for two children versus one child; the father shall pay the Table amount of support for one child to the wife for the youngest child as well as that child's expenses for private school; the wife will be responsible for any extra-curricular activities or tutoring outside the private school; the youngest child will be entitled to the same post-secondary benefits in the same fashion as the two older children; the CRJ is amended to provide that the two oldest children are in the joint care of their parents and will not include any other reference to custody or access; the husband is entitled to specified block access with the youngest child; if flight arrangements are made for this child and she does not fly (and there is no medical reason confirmed in writing by a doctor for that failure), the husband's block access shall be expanded for one week at the next access period and the cost of any penalty from the missed flight will be deducted dollar for dollar from the child support payable by the husband.","[0, 1, 6, 9, 4, 11, 13, 15, 16, 18, 12, 20, 19, 24, 5, 22, 23, 17, 14, 2, 29, 21, 10, 3, 32, 25]"

Singer, Q.C.
for the respondentFIAT DICKSON J.November 9, 1998[1] Both parents want sole custody of their son Challen, born February 10, 1995.
Since they separated in June of 1997, the boy has lived alternating weeks with each parent.
Both now say this arrangement does not work very well.
[2] I am persuaded both parents genuinely love the boy and are equally competent caregivers.
Neither has demonstrated that sole parenting offers an advantage to the boy.
Both have full-time jobs.
During their working hours, the boy has been cared for by babysitters of their respective choice.
The babysitters are members of their respective families and are equally competent.
[3] The future plan of the mother offers the boy an enormous advantage.
She plans to marry her current companion when both of them are divorced from their present spouses.
She will then stay at home and be a full-time parent to Challen.
She is willing that the boy have generous access to his father.
Such an arrangement would be far better for the boy than the present shared parenting arrangement.","Following the collapse of the roofs of two buildings in Newfoundland, both of which were constructed with open web steel joists fabricated by the same company, the Nova Scotia government wrote to owners of buildings containing these joists, including the plaintiff mall owner, recommending that the joists be inspected by a qualified professional engineer.
An inspection of the mall roof revealed that 10.5 per cent of the joists inspected had at least one panel point with a broken or missing weld and the same remediation scheme as that implemented by the Province for the government's own buildings was recommended.
The plaintiff, concerned with safety issues arising from the report, followed the consultant's recommendations and undertook remediation of the mall and then claimed against the defendant, which was the parent company of the corporate entity which had fabricated the joists.
The defendant's expert took the position that although the actual repairs to the welding and webs of the open steel joists was necessary, the reinforcing of the joists undertaken in the remediation was not required in order to mitigate the danger.
Judgment for the plaintiff;
there were defects in the open web steel joists at the mall which constituted a real and substantial danger to the occupants; this danger was caused by the defendant's negligence and the remediation program carried out at the mall was necessary to alleviate the real and substantial danger.
There were internal problems with the welds which could not be discovered by non-destructive inspection and the lack of proper welding procedures and quality control issues at the company prevented one from having confidence in any welds fabricated by them, at least based on external observations.","[0, 1, 2, 4, 5, 7, 6, 9, 3, 8, 10, 12, 11, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18]"

At trial, both Stella and her husband Michael Hlynski (""Mike"") had been seeking an order for exclusive possession of the matrimonial home.
At the time of the trial, they were leading separate lives but under one roof as neither of them would vacate the home.
[2] Stella is 71 years of age and Mike is 77 years of age.
Given Mike's age, the court did not want to specify a date that he had to move from the matrimonial home.
It was hoped that satisfactory alternate arrangements could be made within a reasonable time to avoid the potential of Mike having to make a interim move to satisfy the time limit in a court order when his preferred accommodations might be available shortly thereafter.
Because of this concern, the final paragraph of the judgment reads:""[18] The parties have been married for over 25 years and are now senior citizens.
Although this Court has ordered that Stella is entitled to exclusive possession of the matrimonial home, it is expected that counsel will assist the parties in determining a reasonable time period for Mike to move from the matrimonial home.
If necessary, the court is prepared to provide directions in that regard.""","The applicant seeks leave to intervene in this appeal.
The application is made pursuant to Rule 17 of The Court of Appeal Rules.
HELD: The application for intervention is allowed on condition that it meet the filing deadline, that its material not exceed 12 pages and that it may make oral argument only if requested to do so by the Court.
 1) The intervenor is a non-profit corporation and its members are mutual fund dealers.
Its stated purpose is to regulate the mutual fund distribution industry and its members contractually bind themselves to submit to regulation by the Association.
It contends its purpose in bringing the application is to bring to the Court's attention 'some of the broader policy and contextual considerations that have informed the development of the Mutual Fund Dealers Association (MFDA) and the self-regulatory organizations (SROs) generally.
2) There is no prejudice to the respondent if the applicant's proposed arguments are presented to the Court on the appeal.
The applicant's arguments should simply put the regulatory scheme in context and may assist the Court in its deliberations.
The applicant's arguments are confined to a relatively narrow issue.","[0, 2, 3, 5, 4, 6, 7, 9, 8]"

I reserved decision on the questions of child and spousal maintenance, including costs of access and counselling.
I believe it is common ground that the respondent's 1996 income included the following:Employment $ 22,950.00 Unemployment insurance benefits 5,197.00 Town councillor's indemnity 700.00Total $28,847.00It is argued on behalf of the petitioner, Joy Anne Bartch, that in addition to that income, the respondent has, as shareholder and officer of Bartch Building Movers Ltd., access to additional funds.
He and his brother each own 38% of the voting shares of the company.
The assets of the company increased significantly in 1996 ($103,752.00) from 1995 ($88,399.00).
Wages to officers increased from $50,550.00 in 1995 to $80,900.00 in 1996.
Notwithstanding this increase the company showed an operating profit compared to a deficit in 1995.
It should be noted that the shareholders' loan payable to Robert and Joy Bartch was reduced from $6,400.00 to $2,549.00 in 1996.
That clearly was to the respondent's benefit ($3,851.00).
In addition, the company advanced the sum of $16,952.00 to the respondent's brother, Greg, and his wife, Olivia.
During 1996 the petitioner was paid $781.66 per month by the company.
This was done for income splitting purposes.","The respondent was convicted of having in his possession a controlled substance for the purpose of trafficking contrary to s. 5(2) of the Controlled Drugs and Substances Act (CDSA) and was sentenced to a term of incarceration of 9 months with a 10 year firearms prohibition.
The issues on appeal were: 1) the length of the sentence; and 2) the refusal of the sentencing judge to order forfeiture of the truck used by the respondent to bring the drugs into Saskatchewan and to deliver them.
The sentencing judge found the truck was not 'integral to the offence.'
HELD: The Crown is granted leave to appeal.
1) The appeal against the length of sentence is dismissed.
2) The appeal of the failure to order forfeiture of the truck is allowed.
The truck is ordered forfeited.
1) Although the sentence imposed was at the very low end of the range, in these circumstances, there is no basis for interfering with it.
 2) Upon conviction, the first step the trial judge ought to have taken was to determine whether the property was 'offence-related property' within the meaning of the CDSA.
It is clear the truck is 'offence-related property' in that it was used in connection with the commission of a designated substance offence.
The sentencing judge failed to consider the definition in the CDSA.
Section 19 of the CDSA allows innocent parties who have a valid interest in property to apply for an order of restoration.
However, the innocent party must be either the lawful owner or lawfully entitled to possession of the property which would otherwise be forfeited.
The Court may order in its discretion that the property be returned to the innocent person.
In this case, the vehicle was owned by the respondent and the parents are not lawfully entitled to its possession.
The sentencing judge had no discretion but was required to order forfeiture and erred in failing to do so.
He further erred in considering proportionality as a factor to be considered when dealing with the forfeiture of personal property.","[0, 1, 4, 2, 6, 11, 7, 9, 8, 10, 14, 12, 13, 5]"

The objections to questions or production of documents taken at the examinations for discovery fall under the broad categories of relevance, and privilege.
Background[2] The action arises out of a helicopter crash which occurred in the Republic of Kyrgyzstan on October 4, 1995 which resulted in the death of three crew members and 12 passengers.
[3] The nine plaintiffs are the legal representatives of deceased passengers who were employed by some of the named corporate defendants who were involved in the construction of a gold mine in Kyrgyzstan.
[7] The plaintiffs allege that one or more of the above defendants carried on a negligent and reckless helicopter shuttle operation to and from the work site.
They also allege the defendants knew it was unsafe (paragraph 13 of the statement of claim).
[10] Paragraph 13 of the statement of claim states in part:.","FIAT: The defendants, Sims, Garbriel and Dumurs, bring separate motions, pursuant to Queen's Bench Rule 41(a), for severance of the claims against them or for an order staying the claims against them until the plaintiffs' claim against the primary defendant, Walbaum have been heard and decided.
HELD: 1)
The Court will look at all of the circumstances in deciding whether to grant an application for severance.
 In this case the plaintiffs should not be precluded from adducing evidence related to Walbaum's dealings with each of the applicants or required to segregate the evidence into two, three or four separate trials.
Given the likelihood that the applicants will be required to attend portions of the trial in respect of the Walbaum Group in any event, severance would not necessarily result in a significant saving of time and expense.
 2) The plaintiffs acknowledge that only relatively small portion of trial time (perhaps less than 1 day) will pertain to the claims against any one of the Sims, Gabriel or Dumurs.
It would be unfair to require all of the applicants to participate in all of the trial when very little of it will be relevant to them.
Specific dates and times should be set aside for the plaintiff to call evidence with respect to its claims against each applicant group.
The applicants should be relieved from attending the trial at any other time.","[0, 1, 6, 2, 10, 9, 7, 13, 8, 11, 4, 14, 28, 38, 16, 25]"

[2] In bringing this application the plaintiff asserts that he is ready for trial.
Indeed he states he has been ready for trial for some considerable period of time and that he is standing by while the issues of the cross-claim and third party proceedings which are of no concern to him are debated.
[3] The defendant, Les Oblats de Marie Immaculee du Manitoba, is also ready for trial (except for some minor matters) and concurs that the issues raised by the claim of the plaintiff should proceed to trial at this time.","The appellant appeals his conviction of dangerous driving.
The police did not see the appellant driving; they came across his minivan immersed in a slough in excess of 35 feet off the highway.
Based on the tire tracks, the appellant was charged with dangerous driving.
The trial judge concluded that the circumstantial evidence presented by the Crown was consistent with the appellant's guilt and the circumstantial evidence was inconsistent with any other rational conclusion.
The appellant argues that without expert evidence called by the Crown to prove it was not possible for the appellant to have swerved in the manner he testified to create the same physical evidence shown in the photographs, the Crown has failed to prove that the appellant drove through the stop sign.
In other words, the trial judge could not simply rely on his own experience to find that the appellant could not have been able to manoeuvre the minivan in the way he described.
HELD: Because the Crown's evidence was not the only rational conclusion to be drawn by the trier of fact, the Crown has failed to prove the case beyond a reasonable doubt.
While no accident reconstructionist was available to check the accident scene after the incident, the Crown could have called an expert to testify whether the defence's theory could hypothetically be rational.
However, no expert was called.

As noted by Wilson J. in this case at p. 210, the word ""offences"" as used in s. 11 of the Charter:.
.
.","The outstanding issue is child support, past and future.
The dispute largely centered on what monies were owed from the past.
Central to this was the determination of the respondent's income.
HELD: 1)
The respondent is a farmer.
His income tax returns for the years 2004, 2005 and 2006 have been filed, but certain adjustments must be made.
The purpose of the capital cost allowance is to provide money to purchase replacement equipment.
However, not all of the money is needed and is not used for that purpose.
It is that unused portion which should be allocated as part of the respondent's income.
In this case, 40% of the allowance should be treated as income for the purpose of calculating child support.
The personal portion of the utility costs should be included as part of his income, an appropriate percentage is 25%.
An amount of the legal and accounting costs should be attributed to the respondent personally and added to his income, in 2004 $1,000 is added, in 2005 $5,000 is added and in 2006 $1,000 is added.
The respondent has taken advantage of the optional inventory adjustment and that must be factored back into his income using the methodology set out in Tamke v. Tamke, 2001 SKQB 528.
As the respondent's income has undergone serious fluctuation over the years, it is therefore appropriate that his income for calculating child support be based on the average of his income in the years 2004 and 2005.
2) The respondent will not have to pay half of the cost of Stacey joining a school trip to Europe.
This is because Stacey paid half of the cost herself and because the respondent was asked to contribute at the time but refused.
The petitioner knew the respondent had refused to contribute and, when she elected to pay the balance, she did so unilaterally.
It would be inappropriate to compel the respondent to contribute now.
3) The school fees paid by the petitioner are not extraordinary and should be encompassed in the basis child support.
The health costs in the form of orthodontic treatments are extraordinary and the parties shall contribute equally as their incomes are presently comparable.
3) On five occasions the respondent failed to attend at the agreed meeting spot with the result that the petitioner had to make the entire trip to deliver the children to the respondent so he could exercise access.
She will be compensated for the actual lost wages and fuel costs that she incurred on the respondent's behalf, but not for costs she would have incurred in any event.
 4) The respondent shall pay costs of $1,200.","[1, 0, 2, 3, 5, 9, 8, 7, 14, 11, 15, 16, 17, 6, 4]"

March 14, 2001[1] The applicant seeks an order nisi for sale of a 10 acre parcel of land near Rosetown, Saskatchewan on which the respondents operate an ostrich farming business.
As of February 12, 2001, the amount owing on the mortgage which dates back to October 4, 1988 is $61,194.91.
A current certificate of title still shows the Farm Credit Corporation as a second mortgagee in the amount of $36,000.00, but the affidavit material filed suggests it has been paid out.
The named individuals after the Farm Credit Corporation in the style of cause are members of a law firm that have filed a writ of execution against the property.
The parties agree that since the summer of 1994 the land qualifies as farm land under the Act, and the house located on the property since that time has been a homestead within the meaning of the Act.
Where the parties disagree was whether the property was the respondents' homestead when s. 44(17) of the Act was proclaimed on September 20, 1992.
By the time the respondents entered into the subject mortgage on October 4, 1988 they were living in their home on the property.","The two accused were found guilty, after trial, of robbery with violence contrary to s. 344(b) of the Criminal Code and wearing a mask with the intent to commit an indictable offence contrary to s. 351(2) of the Code.
HELD: The accused are sentenced to 40 months imprisonment for the offence of robbery with violence and 4 months consecutive for the offence of having their faces masked.
Having regard for the fact that the accused have been in custody for nearly 10 months, the Court gives them two for one credit for time served in remand which is 20 months.
The sentence is 2 years to be served in a federal penitentiary.
The sentence takes into consideration their lengthy record of offences committed as young offenders, the gravity of the offence, the violence used against the victim, the fact that a high speed chase ensued in the city, and the need to deter not only these accused but other who might consider committing the offence of robbery.","[0, 1, 2, 4, 5, 7, 11, 6, 10, 15]"

The respondent Heritage Freehold Specialists Ltd. is seeking to lapse the caveats and has served notices to lapse on Home Oil in respect to all of the caveats.
Each of the caveats is based on an agreement taken by Freeholders Oil Company Limited from the registered owner of the minerals.
Heritage fairly concedes that it is not seeking a summary dismissal of the application to continue the caveats.

BACKGROUND[2] On July 14, 1997, Rodh and Sarauer, who were then living together, but not married, purchased a residential property for $100,000.00.
They retained a lawyer in Lloydminster, Saskatchewan, who prepared a written agreement and attended to having it signed by both the sellers and the purchasers.
In that agreement Rodh and Sarauer were described as joint tenants.
The same lawyer also acted for them in preparing a mortgage, in which they were again described as joint tenants.
[3] The sellers were not represented by legal counsel.
On August 20, 1997, title issued in the name of Rodh and Sarauer without the words “as joint tenants” appearing thereon.","The worker was unsuccessful in his claim for compensation for gradual onset stress when the Workers' Compensation Appeal Tribunal (WCAT) found that the conditions in his workplace did not constitute unusual or excessive stressors as required under the terms of the relevant Board policy.

Appeal dismissed;
the WCAT correctly applied the objective approach in determining whether there were workplace events or stressors sufficient to support a claim for gradual onset stress.

The parties entered into an agreement in early 1997 in which the respondent as lessor agreed to lease a tractor- trailer unit to the applicant for the payments specified therein.
The applicant made payments for several months and acknowledges in her affidavit that by the month of June, 1997, she was in default with respect to such payments.
The respondent seized the vehicle on July 3, 1997.
.","The claimant purchaser brought an action for breach of contract and negligent misrepresentation, claiming that although the defendant vendors had advised her that there had been some damage to the chimney base in the residence, she had been told that this was a minor problem which was under repair and she had not been properly advised of a history of repeated flooding. 
Following the purchase of the property, the claimant had commenced renovations and discovered extensive mould or rot throughout the basement, to such an extent that the entire basement had to be gutted, disinfected and rebuilt.
She also claimed that a buried cistern was discovered in the backyard, which had been partly filled with earth but still filled up with rainwater and melted snow, and that the water had nowhere else to go but against the foundation.
When the defendants brought a motion for non-suit at the conclusion of her case, the unrepresented claimant expressed surprise and dismay that her case could be dismissed before both sides had testified as she expected her remaining evidence to come out through the defendants' testimony.
Motion granted; the claim against the defendants is dismissed;
it is the responsibility of the buyer to verify the accuracy of the Property Condition Disclosure Statement (PCDS) and, in this case, the claimant had made no inquiry as to the statements made by the defendants of structural problems or unrepaired damage or leakage in the foundation.
The claimant had notification, both in the PCDS and from her home inspector, that there were leakage problems in the basement and the inspection report had advised her of the need to make further enquiries.
There was no evidence the latent defects (the cracks in the wall, the mould and the rotten wood) were visible to the defendants when they occupied the home, that there was continual leakage of which the defendants were aware or that the defendants had performed any repairs to the home during their occupancy to cover up the wood rot.
Although there was evidence that the defendants were aware of the cistern and had not disclosed this to the claimant, there was no evidence to conclude that the cistern was causing the problem.","[0, 1, 2, 5, 3, 6, 9, 7]"

The landlord appealed, taking the position that there had been no mould and the tenant had simply used grey spray paint to resemble mould.
It was also questioned how the mould could only have affected the tenant's furniture and area rug but not be obvious on the other carpeting.
Landlord's appeal dismissed; amount of damages ordered increased;
the Director went too far in discounting the value of the tenant's belongings.
The court relied on the by-law inspector's (who had been called in by the tenant) findings, finding it impossible to believe that he could have been fooled by something as amateurish as spray paint and that the tenant, had she actually resorted to such a tactic, would have called in a building inspector and hoped to get away with it.","[1, 0, 4, 2, 5, 7, 13, 19, 32, 22, 26, 17, 33, 3, 35, 12, 34, 11, 41]"

AUTO INC.
DEFENDANTS Brian J. Scherman and for the plaintiffs Karen M. BolstadBryan E. Salte for the defendants FIAT HALVORSON J. July 2, 1996 Clearly, the defendant, Kasper Gordon Bawolin (""Bawolin""), has been in contempt of court orders requiring that he account to the plaintiff, Viola Rose Siemens (""Siemens""), for her trust funds.
His contempt however, is not as blatant as appeared initially.
For example, a part at least, of his failure to produce documentation arises from the sorry state of his records.
The contempt has been purged sufficiently to permit the Court to withdraw from further intervention.
Proper identification of assets has resulted largely through production orders against third parties, but also, through belated efforts by Bawolin.
Additional information demanded by Siemens can be obtained through the normal discovery process.
That is not to say Siemens cannot move for relief if Bawolin displays intransigence.
All that remains at this juncture is the issue of responsibility for the legal costs incurred by Siemens to compel production.","The appellant was tried by Queen's Bench judge sitting alone and found guilty of operating a motor vehicle while his ability to operate the vehicle was impaired by alcohol, thereby causing death contrary to s. 255(3) of the Criminal Code, and causing bodily harm contrary to s. 255(2) of the Code.
He was sentenced to 5 years imprisonment after having been given credit of 1 year for the time served on remand.
The appellant appeals both his conviction and sentence.
On the conviction appeal the appellant raises a technical ground in relation to the manner in which the appellant was charged as well as issues of the propriety and fairness of the cross-examination of himself by Crown counsel, the admissibility of his criminal record at trial, and the admissibility of opinion evidence proved in the testimony of the Crown's expert witness on accident reconstruction.
He also argues that the trial judge failed to find that the fact that the appellant was impaired at the time of the collision was the cause of the collision and that his conclusion was unreasonable and against the weight of the evidence.
HELD: Appeal dismissed.
 1) The trial judge has a discretion pursuant to R. v. Corbett, [1988]
1 S.C.R. 670, to exclude prejudicial evidence of prior convictions in an appropriate case.
This discretion is exercised by the trial judge on the application of an accused at the close of the Crown's case.
See R. v. Underwood, [1998]
1 S.C.R. 77.
As such an application was not raised in this case, and the questioning about previous convictions by the Crown was not objected to when it occurred, and the issue of the appellant's previous alcohol related offences was raised in the appellant's own examination in chief, this court concludes that there is no basis for this Court to conclude that the cross-examination was inappropriate or that the evidence adduced was inadmissible.
 2) It is not proper for Crown counsel to ask an accused on cross-examination to explain the testimony of a Crown witness, and that it is highly unfair and prejudicial to require an accused to agree with a Crown witness or stigmatize that witness as a 'liar'.
Crown counsel should not have put these sorts of questions and the trial judge ought not to have permitted them.
Defence counsel did not object to them.
However, this Court is not satisfied that this error had any effect on the trial and this ground of appeal fails.
 3) The Crown elicited opinion evidence from Constable Gibson in the area of accident reconstruction.
No evidence was at any time offered as to his expertise to do so, other than his curriculum vitae, which was filed.
This witness's evidence as to how the bodies might have moved in the vehicle in the course of the collision and its aftermath, and in particular, his conclusory opinion that Ms. McDermott was the passenger and Mr. Bear the driver, ought not to have been received in the absence of a ruling that he was qualified as an expert in relation to those matters, and that his expertise was necessary in relation to the subject matter of his testimony, and that his opinion was based on facts before the Court. 4)
The appellant was charged and convicted with offences pursuant to s. 255(2) and s. 255(3) of the Criminal Code.
The appellant argues that conviction requires that the appellant has been charged with an offence pursuant to s. 253(a).
There is no merit in this ground of appeal.
Impaired driving causing death and bodily harm are routinely charged in this manner.
5) This Court's review of the cross-examination of the appellant supports the trial judge's assessment of it as unbelievable.
In light of the trial judge's findings of credibility, and the results of the DNA analysis of the samples taken, the evidence overwhelmingly supports the verdict reached by the trial judge that the appellant was driving.
The conclusory opinions expressed by Constable Gibson in relation to the movements of the occupants in the truck, and as to who was driving the vehicle, played no meaningful role in a conclusion that was, compelled by the remaining evidence.
Notwithstanding the errors apparent in the receipt of opinion evidence from Constable Gibson, there was no substantial miscarriage of justice.
The appeal from conviction is dismissed.
6) The trial judge did not commit any error of principle in coming to the conclusion that an appropriate sentence was 6 years imprisonment.
While the sentence is at the high end of the available range, it is not outside the range available in the circumstances of this case.","[0, 1, 4, 3, 6, 7, 2, 8, 9, 5, 10, 11, 12]"

The defendant seeks to have the costs reduced because the plaintiff was unsuccessful in part of her claim.
The trial did not commence until November 27, 2000.
It lasted for parts of 12 days.
On November 22, 2000, the defendant served an offer to settle for $75,000.00 plus taxable costs.
The offer was not accepted by the plaintiff.
The judgment obtained by the plaintiff was for $77,406.15 together with some additional special damages and pre-judgment interest for a total judgment of $120,540.43.
ISSUES[3] The issues to be resolved on this application include: 1.
Whether the success of each party affects the amount of costs to be awarded to either; 2.
What amount should be awarded for expert witnesses; and; 3.
The level at which a second counsel fee should be taxed or allowed.","The defendant farmer pled guilty to failing to take every precaution that was reasonable in the circumstances to ensure the health and safety of persons in the workplace, after a young employee drowned in a manure pit that was not properly secured due to a damaged barricade having been removed while a new one was on order.

The application was opposed.
The trial judge directed the defendants to proceed by notice of motion in chambers, and the trial was adjourned.
THE FACTS[2] This action was commenced in 1995 and proceeded to discovery of documents, examinations for discovery and a pre-trial conference.
It was set down for trial at Saskatoon, and the trial commenced on October 25, 1999.
At the opening the defendants applied to amend their statement of defence by pleading Accord and Satisfaction.
The plea was based on the allegation that the parties had settled their differences in October, 1988, as a result of negotiations between the solicitors then representing the parties.
[3] The defendants’ application came before me in chambers on November 25, 1999.
THE PLEADINGS AND PROPOSED AMENDMENTS[4] The plaintiff sued the defendants for breaches of trust.
The defendants categorically denied the allegations and stated that any property which they held for her was delivered to her many years ago.
This plea is epitomized by the wording of para.
4 of the statement of defence and I quote:4.
The defendants also counterclaim for other monies which are not relevant to this application.
[5] The applicants (defendants) wish to add the following paragraphs to their defence:4A.","The parties entered into an agreement and registered it with the court in 2008.
It provided for a combined spousal/child support payment of $2,000/month, which the husband was able to claim on his taxes because of the shared custody arrangement they were in at the time.
At the time of their divorce in 2009, the wife wanted to incorporate the agreement into the corollary relief judgment.
The husband argued a dramatic drop in his income forced him to abandon the parties' shared parenting regime, which resulted in significant tax consequences and justified a change to the agreement's support provisions to include only the table amount of child support.
He argued the change in circumstances was so extensive as to undermine the integrity of the agreement.
The evidence showed the wife needed $2,000/month in order to keep the bank from foreclosing on the home she occupied with the children, and to allow her to finish retraining so she could enter the workforce.
The husband (a self-employed financial planner) argued the recent world economic crisis had adversely affected his business to an extent unanticipated when the agreement was executed (October 2008).
The evidence showed that his focus was to solicit new business rather than cut expenses to make his business more viable.
He chose to spend less time with the children to do this, which impacted the children and wife.
The agreement is binding; the support provisions are to be incorporated into the corollary relief judgement.
This concerns an agreement registered under the Maintenance and Custody Act.
It is not an application to vary under the Divorce Act, but rather an application to overturn an agreement (although the distinction doesn't impact the outcome).
The terms of the agreement must be given great deference.
Will enforcing it reflect the parties' original intent and be in substantial compliance with the Act?
The court looked at the second branch of the test in Miglin: whether something has happened that was outside the parties' contemplation when the agreement was made.
Care must be taken to distinguish between circumstances giving rise to the agreement and those making compliance difficult.
Taking judicial notice, the court observed the world economic crisis was the subject of much debate before the agreement was made, even if it was more extreme than anticipated.
Here, the agreement: used strong, unambiguous language; was arrived at after extensive negotiations by sophisticated parties and with the assistance of counsel; and was very important to each party.
To overturn it would not be in the children's best interests: they would lose their home and their mother would be unable to finish her retraining, adversely impacting her ability to provide for them.
The change in the husband's circumstances are less likely to impact the integrity of the agreement than would his proposal to disregard it.
The husband cannot unilaterally alter the agreement simply by deciding to change the parenting arrangements.
His decision to work additional hours and spend less time with his children was not reasonable or fair and in effect transferred the financial and parenting burden to the wife (who was also managing significant financial and professional challenges).","[0, 1, 2, 4, 6, 5, 10, 8, 11, 13, 14, 7, 9, 17, 16, 12]"

C-8.2 finding the respondent in contempt of court for deliberately disobeying the terms of the August 15, 2002 access order of Koch J. respecting the child of the parties, [A.K.L.
], born […], 2000.
He seeks a fine and an order that the respondent bring the child to Saskatoon for access visits.
The respondent applies for an order varying the terms of that access order.
She seeks to restrict access visits to supervised visits in Brandon, Manitoba.
[2] At the outset of the applications I raised jurisdiction, service and time issues.
To avoid an adjournment, counsel for both parties consented to the court’s jurisdiction, the acknowledgement of service and the abridgement of time.
Issue[3] The first issue is whether the respondent is in contempt of court and the nature of the appropriate penalty.
The second is what disposition should be made respecting ongoing access.
Background Facts[4] The parties never cohabited.
The child was born from a brief sexual encounter.
The respondent subsequently married another man on October 19, 2002 and is pregnant with another child.
Despite paying child support, the petitioner has enjoyed virtually no access.","Mr. Kenny is charged under The Wildlife Act Regulations, 1981 with use of a searchlight when hunting.

Merchant, Q.C.
for the respondentFIAT WILKINSON J.November 18, 2002[1] The father applies to have the mother cited for contempt for denial of access.
By fiat of October 4, 2002, Matheson J. transferred custody to the father and directed the mother to “give viva voce evidence in response to the allegation of contempt”.
[2] The mother had filed an affidavit in response to the father’s motion.
361, Denning M.R.
stated that a respondent who chooses to give evidence voluntarily cannot, as of right, refuse to be cross-examined.
Accordingly, any jurisdictional or procedural objections on the mother’s part are obviated.
I confined my inquiry to those grounds.
[4] The recurring problem is that the child fusses and does not want to go.
The mother only tells him five minutes beforehand so he will not be upset.
Although the mother claims she warns the child 45 minutes in advance of access visits, this was expressly contradicted by the testimony of the maternal grandmother.","In 1999 the plaintiff Bank granted the defendant, Wheatland, a credit facility of $500,000 plus an additional $20,000 in Visa Credit, all financed by means of a general security agreement pledging Wheatland's present and after acquired personal property with personal guarantees from two individuals.
In April 1999 the Bank registered its security interest with the Personal Property Registry (PPR).
Wheatland carried on business as a farm equipment dealer.
Wheatland entered into dealership agreements with equipment suppliers (CNH).
The Bank entered into a priority agreement whereby the Bank postponed its interest in favour of CNH.
The issue in the present application is the Bank's priority with respect to credits for returned parts.
The issues require an interpretation of the respective priority agreements between the Bank and the CNH companies.
HELD: 1) The critical issue is the distinction between inventory and credits paid for by Wheatland and inventory and credits financed by CNH that Wheatland has not paid for.
The objective of the contracting parties when they entered the priority agreement was that the CNH security would have priority over the Bank security as to Wheatland inventory supplied by the suppliers but not paid for by Wheatland or returned for credit.
But once the supplied inventory was paid for by Wheatland, the Bank's general security on Wheatland's present and after acquired property would prevail.
 2) The second issue only arises as the result of the first issue.
It relates to the Receiver's right to require CNH Canada to repurchase parts inventory acquired from CNH Canada or its predecessors, notwithstanding that these parts were shipped direct to Wheatland by third party suppliers at the request of CNH.
The issue arises pursuant to s. 50(14)(c) of The Agricultural Implements Act (AIA).
While it is obvious that the direct ship parts are contractually excluded, the question is whether the direct shipped parts in this case were 'specially ordered' by Wheatland as stipulated in s. 50(14)(c) of the Act.
The direct ship parts at issue consist of very ordinary articles such as nuts and bolts, washers, O-rings, seals, gaskets and bearings.
The contractual provisions entitle CNH to refuse to restock direct ship parts.
However s. 50(2) and s. 50(3) override the contrary contractual provisions in certain circumstances.
It appears that the contractual arrangements were intended to enable CNH to opt out of its AIA obligations to repurchase inventory from a terminated dealer.
The AIA does not permit or accommodate such opting out.
The provisions of s. 50 appear to be designed to protect the supplier as well as the dealer.
The Court is not persuaded that the parts in this case were in any way unique or specially ordered.
They were commonplace articles of personal property required by a farm machinery dealer for its use and for use by its retail customers.","[0, 1, 2, 4, 7, 5, 11, 6, 10, 9, 16, 14, 17, 18, 3]"

May 15, 2002[1] The respondent father applies to vary a consent order dated April 5, 2001, by reducing his required child support payments from $236.00 per month to $19.00 per month.
The consent order was granted one month after the respondent had quit his employment at Lilydale Foods in Wynyard.
Although he remained unemployed, the respondent agreed to pay child support based upon an imputed annual income of $17,386.00, which is what he had been earning at Lilydale Foods.
[2] The material indicates that the respondent’s circumstances have changed since April of 2001.
First, he is now employed as a tow truck driver, and says that he is earning an annualized income of only $7,510.00.
Second, following the consent order he purchased a one-half ton truck on which he has been making payments of $624.00 per month.
Third, he is no longer residing with his girlfriend, with whom he shared expenses.","The accused were both charged with assault contrary to s. 266.
The complainant admitted that he threw the first punch but said that he did so because the male accused had already broken the windows in his car and punched his passenger and was not 'coming to apologize.'
HELD: The accused were convicted of assault.
Whether the physical altercation was precipitated by jealousy or a drug deal, there is no doubt that the accused was the aggressor throughout.
He smashed one, if not two, car windows.
The accused's behaviour was threatening and the Court accepted that the accused had not attended the house to apologize.
The complainant took necessary and lawful action to protect himself and his family under s. 37 of the Criminal Code. 
While the Court did not believe that either complainant used a weapon, if it did occur it would have been justified in the context of the assault.
The accused was acquitted of mischief because the Crown failed to prove the value of the broken windows.","[0, 1, 2, 4, 5, 3, 7, 6, 8, 9, 10]"

Pillipow for the petitioner (respondent)Allan Walter Alexander Biggar on his own behalfFIAT M-E. WRIGHT J.July 13, 1998[1] The applicant, Allan Walter Alexander Biggar, seeks to vary the child support provisions contained in a judgment for divorce granted September 17, 1997 to an amount that accords with the Federal Child Support Guidelines [Divorce Act Regulations, SOR/97-175].
BACKGROUND[2] The applicant and respondent, Bonnie Mary Biggar, married on June 21, 1985.
The parties separated on July 3, 1995 and on July 23, 1997 entered into an interspousal agreement.
[3] Pursuant to the terms of their agreement, the respondent has custody of the children and the applicant has reasonable access on reasonable notice.
The parties agreed that child support payable by the applicant would be in accordance with an interim order made in this proceeding on June 10, 1996.
That order required the applicant to pay child support in the amount of $700 per month for each of the two children.
[4] The agreement also provided for a final division of matrimonial property.","The defendant applied for dismissal of the plaintiff's claim for want of prosecution.
The claim was issued November 1, 1999 and is based in debt for goods and services provided to the defendant.
The value of the claim is $521,283.99 and refers to provision of materials, products and services in 1995 and 1996.
The statement of defence was filed November 12, 1999 and amended in 2002.
In the intervening years, the Chief of the defendant Indian Band died as did the person who had been appointed the proper person to be examined on behalf of the defendant.HELD: The decision to dismiss an application for want of prosecution is discretionary.
A three step process was set out in International Capital Corporation v. Robinson Twigg &amp; Ketilson et al., 2010 SKCA 48.
In this case, a delay of in excess of 5 years does not constitute inordinate delay when compared to the progress in comparable cases.
The amount claimed is significant and there is no suggestion in the amended defence that the goods, products and related services were not provided.
Subject to compliance with undertakings, the matter is ready to be referred to pre-trial settlement conference.
There is no legal excuse offered on the part of the plaintiff for the inordinate delay in this case.
The plaintiff bears the onus of convincing the Court on a balance of probabilities that the delay was excusable and its materials fall short.
While there may be some prejudice to the defendant in mounting a defence because of the death of some of the people who were intimately involved in the dealings between the parties, there is an individual available who is intimately familiar with the dealings between the parties and there are discovery transcripts that might be of assistance.
Both parties have records and documentation that can be tendered at a trial.
The Court concluded that the interest of justice favored continuing with the action.
The application to dismiss the action for want of prosecution was denied.","[1, 0, 2, 5, 8, 3, 9, 7, 10, 4, 11]"

for the applicant (plaintiff)Kevin C. Mellor for the respondent (defendant)FIAT SCHEIBEL J. October 22, 1999I[1] The plaintiff, referred to as “TFPG”.
II[2] At the outset of the argument counsel agreed that the relief sought in paragraph (i) of the draft order should issue with the right of the respondent to make and keep copies of the documents turned over to the applicant.
That part of the order may issue.
[3] During argument counsel for the applicant abandoned the relief sought in paragraph (iii).
This leaves the issues raised in paragraph (ii) of the draft order to be resolved.
III[4] The respondent was a registered representative of the applicant and entered into a Shareholder Advisor Agreement whereby the respondent agreed he would sell and represent only the applicant’s financial products and services which the applicant approved.
In exchange for this the respondent received commissions from the applicant.
[5] It is alleged the respondent sold unapproved investments of a competitor and as a result he was terminated pursuant to the agreement.","The accused was charged under s. 5(2) of the Controlled Drugs and Substances Act after a highway traffic stop in which the accused was driving a motorhome that was found to be modified to carry cocaine and marijuana by a group of officers designated to search for drugs in vehicles.
The cocaine found in the motorhome had an estimated street value of between 1.1 and 2.5 million dollars.
The marijuana had an estimated street value between $471,000 and $733,000.
The officer who stopped the motorhome saw it weave from the centre line to the fog line approximately six times.
The officer testified that he suspected the driver might be impaired by alcohol.
The officer stopped the vehicle and found no indicia of impairment by alcohol.
The officer ran the motorhome on his computer system and found that it was registered to the driver.
Another officer arrived on scene and approached the motorhome.
The second officer noted a smell of fabric softener in the vehicle and testified that the accused appeared unusually nervous.
The second officer testified that fabric sheets are frequently used to mask the odour of drugs.
The second officer testified that he suspected the Vehicle Identification number on the dash had been tampered with because the rivets looked too new.
He testified that he compared the Vehicle Identification Number on the dash to the number on the door and found they did not match.
He later acknowledged that he was in error and later discovered that the numbers did match.
The second officer commenced a search of the vehicle purportedly to search for paperwork that would confirm that the vehicle was not stolen.
The accused was arrested for possession of stolen property.
As the officer searched the vehicle, he noted signs that it had been modified.
A drug sniffer dog was brought to the scene and had a positive reaction near the rear vent of the motorhome.
The officers conducted a search of the vehicle which revealed that the motorhome hnd been significantly modified for the purpose of transporting illegal drugs.
The accused was arrested for trafficking.
The accused advised the officers that he wanted to contact a lawyer after he was arrested for trafficking.
Another officer attended the scene to transport the accused to the detachment.
That officer assisted with the search of the motorhome for approximately half an hour before driving the accused another hour and a half to the detachment where he was allowed to contact a lawyer.
The accused argued that his rights under ss. 8, 9 and 10 of the Charter were infringed and sought exclusion under s. 24(2).
HELD: Section 8 Ã» The motorhome had been extensively modified for the purpose of carrying contraband and could no longer be used as a motor home because its domestic systems had been disabled.
The accused was entitled to no greater expectation of privacy in the vehicle than he would have had in any other passenger vehicle that he had the ability to regulate access to.
The officers did not have a reasonable suspicion that the motorhome was stolen.
The real purpose of the detention and arrest for possession of stolen property was to search the vehicle for drugs.
The observations of the second officer on scene to support his reasonable suspicion that the motorhome was stolen were not capable of verification.
He chose not to look at or consider the available information indicating the vehicle was not stolen including: the valid registration presented by the accused and the information from the CPIC query.
Virtually all of the other observations of this officer had little to do with the possibility of a stolen vehicle and were indicators of a vehicle suspected of carrying contraband.
In conducting the search, the officers were acting on little more than a hunch based on intuition.
The search of the motorhome incidental to the accused's arrest for possession of stolen property amounted to a breach of s. 8.
By the time the sniffer dog was deployed, the police had a reasonable suspicion that the accused was transporting drugs.
However, the search of the motorhome and observations of its modifications were incidental to the arbitrary arrest of the accused for possession of stolen property, therefore, their grounds for the reasonable suspicion did not support the deployment of the sniffer dog.
Section 9 Ã» 
The arresting officer did not have reasonable and probable grounds to believe the motor home had been stolen when he arrested the accused.
He had not carried out even a cursory investigation into the possibility that it might have been stolen.
His inability to compare the two vehicle identification numbers accurately was willful blindness or flagrantly negligent.
The accused was arbitrarily detained when he was arrested for possession of stolen property.
The observations that lead to the reasonable and probable grounds to arrest the accused for trafficking were derived from his arbitrary arrest for possession of stolen property.
The detention had little practical effect on the accused because he remained confined to the back of the police car as a result of the earlier arrest for possession of stolen property.
Section 10 Ã» 
The accused was not provided with an opportunity to retain and instruct counsel in a timely fashion.
However, the police did not attempt to elicit any incriminating evidence from the accused during the time it took to get him to the detachment to call a lawyer.
There is no causal connection between the breach of the accused's rights under s. 10(b) and the discovery of the drugs.
The evidence was excluded under s. 24(2).
The breaches of the accused's rights under ss. 8 and 9 were very serious.
The officer was so determined to find evidence of contraband that he became blinded to the constitutional requirements of a reasonable suspicion for investigative detention and reasonable and probable grounds for arrest.
His actions showed a flagrant disregard for Charter requirements.
The deprivation of liberty and privacy resulting from the breaches was significant but not egregious.
These two factors favor excluding the evidence.
The charge is a serious one and involves a large quantity of drugs.
The evidence is highly reliable and critical to the Crown's case.
The truth seeking function of the Court favours admitting the evidence.
On balance, the administration of justice would be brought into disrepute if the evidence was admitted and that standard is paramount.","[1, 0, 3, 2, 4, 8, 6, 7, 9, 11, 10, 12]"

May 19, 2000FACTS[1] The applicant divorced husband applies to vary the spousal support provisions contained in a separation agreement dated June 18, 1975 (the ""agreement) between he and the respondent, Patricia Margaret Pearson.
By virtue of paragraph 4(a) of the agreement the parties agreed that the initial sum of $550.00 would be paid for spousal support and further agreed “the said payment shall continue until the wife remarries or dies, whichever date occurs the sooner”.
The agreement provided for annual adjustments to the spousal amount payable based upon the increase in the Consumer Price Index for Regina-Saskatoon.
The respondent asserts that the amount that should now be paid pursuant to the terms of the agreement exceeds $1,000.00.
Although this was paid as the adjusted amount due in 1995 it was unilaterally reduced by the applicant to $627.55 per month in February of that year.
[2] The applicant continues to pay this spousal support which (except for the unilateral reduction in 1995) he has been paying for in excess of 25 years in accordance with the terms of the agreement.
The basis of the applicant’s variation application is that he is now 67 years old and retired.","The defendant, who was in a very small apartment with two other individuals, got up from the couch and proceeded through a doorway behind the complainant, purportedly to use the bathroom.
A few minutes later, the complainant found something wrapped around his neck and he was choked until he passed out.
When he regained consciousness, he was lying on the floor with the defendant crouched over him.
She left without saying a word and he later discovered that money was missing from his wallet, which he found under his back.
The defendant was convicted of robbery when the complainant maintained that the third person in the room never left his sight and was still seated directly in front of him when he felt something being tightened around his throat.
Although the third person's testimony supported the complainant's evidence, the defendant alleged that while she was in the bathroom, she heard a commotion and when she came out she saw the complainant lying on the floor and the other individual stated that she 'had the money' as she ran out the door.
Not knowing what to do, she crouched over the complainant and lifted his head to see if he was okay.
When he came to and said he was going to call the police, she ran because she was afraid of having her parole revoked.
She appealed the conviction on the basis that the trial judge had erred in treating the conflicting Crown and defence evidence as a credibility contest.
Appeal dismissed;
 it was clear that the trial judge had accepted the complainant's evidence as to what had occurred along with the other witness' evidence as to who had strangled him and rejected the defendant's testimony and denials of responsibility.
Although he did not specifically refer to the principles in R. v. Wry (1991) (SCC), the court was satisfied he recognized their importance and did not fall into the trap of simply comparing the Crown and defence positions without assessing the whole of the evidence.
The complainant never wavered in his evidence that the other individual had never left his sight and was still seated directly in front of him when he felt something being tightened around his throat, which was supported by the other individual's testimony.","[0, 1, 3, 6, 5, 7, 8, 4, 9]"

March 26, 2001[1] Three motions have been brought.
With the consent of the plaintiff, it was ordered that the claim against the Attorney General for Saskatchewan be dismissed.
[3] The third motion is brought by the plaintiff who seeks several orders of which two were granted summarily and one was adjourned sine die.
What remains is an application for an order, if necessary, extending a limitation period nunc pro tunc.
[4] The two applications of the defendants, insofar as they are based on Rule 188, are dismissed.
That rule provides for a determination of a point of law.
Even though the applications are grounded in a limitation period, there still is a factual component and absent an agreed statement of facts there should not be an order granted under Rule 188.
[5] As I see it, the remaining substantive issues which need to be determined can be summarized as follows.
(1) Whether the plaintiff's claim is barred by a statutory limitation period.
(2) Whether any limitation period should be extended nunc pro tunc.","Rule 85.04 – Order for confidentiality
The parties moved under Rule 59.60 to have the court seal their file after media asked to view it.
They didn't ask to exclude the public from the hearing, nor did they seek a publication ban.
 , the file will be sealed.
While Rule 59.60 doesn't provide guidance on when it would be appropriate to seal a file, Rule 85.04(1) does.
The SCC decision of Dagenais (and related cases) applies.
A confidentiality order should only be granted when: necessary to prevent a serious risk to an important interest; there are no less intrusive measures available; and the benefits outweigh the costs.
Personal embarrassment or damage to a party's reputation isn't enough.
Here, the important public interest is the protection of personal identifiers (e.g. SIN's, addresses, bank account numbers and other personal information required on court documents).
Having these identifiers accessible to members of the public can result in identity theft, which is a real and serious concern.
The court is able to take judicial notice of the fact society values the prevention of identity theft (and that it exists in the first place).
There are no less intrusive measures to prevent access to this personal information that aren't cumbersome and costly for the parties and court administration staff.
The salutary effects of a sealing order outweigh its deleterious effects, especially since the public will still be permitted to access the court hearing and any decision that is rendered.
The open court principle was crafted at a time when the internet wasn't a public source of information and manipulation.","[0, 9, 1, 7, 17, 8, 16, 15, 3, 20, 6, 19, 18, 11, 14, 21]"

March 20, 2001[1] The applicant mother applies to vary the terms of the child support order made against her on March 1, 1999.
It provided that she pay $400 per month support for the three children of the marriage, namely Brady McMillan born November 19, 1996, Jessica McMillan born May 2, 1989, and Kory McMillan born February 2, 1991.
The order was made in connection with a previous variation application brought by the applicant to vary a former $450.00 per month child support order.
The applicant in her second variation application seeks cancellation of the arrears of $3,800 on the basis that she will otherwise in effect be required to overpay child support had it been calculated in accordance with the Guidelines on the basis of her actual (not imputed) income for the years 1999 and 2000.
She also seeks a variation of the ongoing child support to $17.00 per month, being the Guideline amount based on her projected annual income for 2001 of just over $7,000.","The parties were married almost nine years and have two children, ages eight and 10.
 The mother was highly critical of the father's ability to parent, and opposed his application for shared custody.
She accused him of abusive behavior, using drugs/abusing alcohol, and claimed he did not help parent when they lived together.
The level of conflict between the two was high.
Each lived with new partners.
They both filed expense statements showing significant monthly deficits but, since they had declared bankruptcy, there was no evidence of how they were meeting the shortfall.
The mother sought a share of the father's pension, including his pre-marriage contributions, spousal support and child support.
She worked through most of the marriage, but earned a lot less than the father did.
Interim shared parenting, with a review in eight months.
This is not an ideal arrangement, but the alternatives will leave the children worse off.
The father was more credible; the mother's allegations are unsubstantiated.
While he's contributed to the conflict in the past, he is making an effort while the mother and her partner are not.
The mother will have the final say on health related matters, and the father will have the final say on the choice of childcare and helping with homework (because he is francophone and better able to help).
If the mother is unable to learn how to work with the father, the court will consider awarding him custody.
On review, the court will consider the parties' ability to communicate and cooperate, including whether or not they are able to agree about extracurricular activities for the children.
The father will pay child support in the set-off amount.
While he has twice her income, the mother hasn't proven the set-off amount is insufficient to enable her to meet the children's needs while they're with her.
It's impossible to have a deficit without disclosing the debt instruments used to support debt accumulation.
Her partner is either meeting her shortfall or her expenses are overstated.
It would be unfair and unconscionable to award her half of the pre-marriage pension contributions based on the length of the marriage and the fact she wasn't economically dependant on the father.
She's not entitled to spousal support.
Even if she was, the father has no ability to pay given his obligations to the children.","[0, 1, 2, 4, 3, 5, 7, 6, 9, 10]"

for the respondentFIAT McLELLAN J. July 25, 1997The applicant mother seeks to have the ongoing child support of $180.00 per month per child for the three children of the marriage increased.
The respondent father filed copies of his last three income tax returns.
The returns indicate that, after adjustments, he had an average gross taxable income of $28,000.00.
However, the file also indicates that his net worth has increased substantially since the original order in 1993.
His financial statement filed that year showed a net worth of $105,744.00 after deducting debts of $352,655.00.
The current financial statement discloses that he now has a net worth of $484,684.00 after deducting debts of $342,000.00.
The increase amounts to approximately $380,000.00.
His 1996 tax return also indicates that he purchased stock in that year (which he claimed as an expense) totalling $202,061.00.
It would appear that he did not do so with borrowed funds as his total debts were reduced by $10,000.00 since 1993.
He must therefore have used income generated from the farm to pay the purchase price.","The accused was charged with trafficking in cocaine and possession of cocaine for the purposes of trafficking.
He was arrested within minutes of two officers observing what they believed to be a drug transaction.
After watching the accused roam the street, they had observed him meet up and speak briefly with another person, whom he motioned to follow him and they proceeded by different routes, meeting up at the rear corner of a building.
Although the area was dimly lit, one of the officers saw the accused remove something from a small pink plastic bag, which he then placed in the other person's hand.
The encounter was very brief and neither officer observed any money exchanged.
A ball of crack cocaine was later seized from the other person's jacket pocket.
Although no drugs were found on the accused, a search of the area located a pink baggy of drugs stashed in a rock wall close to ground level.
The defence argued that the drugs seized from the other person could have come from anywhere and constructive possession had not been proven with respect to the baggy located in the wall.
Accused found guilty on both counts;
the court accepted that the drugs found in the wall belonged to him and his possession was constructive, done knowingly for his use and benefit so he could return to the stash for his next transaction.
The encounter described was consistent with low level street trafficking (brief and direct contact between buyer and seller, the passing communication and gesture to go to another place to avoid police scrutiny and the frequent disposal of the remaining drugs by stashing) and inconsistent with any other possible explanation.
Moments after handing something to the other person, the accused's silhouette was observed in the area where the drugs were stashed and the court was satisfied that he had placed the drugs in the wall minutes before his arrest.","[0, 1, 4, 3, 5, 2, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12]"

[2] The applicant proposed to the respondent that it repay the judgment recovered by the latter as follows:Beginning balance, as per judgment: 122,601.36 October interest 520.64 123,122.00 Awarded costs 7,572.50 Balance October 31, 2000 130,694.50November 1, 2000 payment 32,894.50 97,800.00 November interest 401.92 December interest 415.32 Balance December 31, 2000 98,617.23January 1, 2001 payment 33,117.23 65,500.00 January interest 278.15 February interest 251.23 Balance February 28, 2001 66,029.38March 1, 2001 payment 33,529.38 32,500.00 March interest 138.01 April interest 133.56 Balance April 30, 2001 32,771.58May 1, 2001 payment 32,771.58Balance May 1, 2001 0.00 [3] The respondent objects strenuously pointing out that the applicant had plenty of opportunity over the years to pay its obligation and also drawing attention to a number of allegations made in Mr. Tait’s affidavits and elsewhere suggesting that the officers of the applicant mismanaged the affairs of the company or re-directed funds which should have been allocated to payment of the interest which is the subject matter of the judgment I finally granted.
[4] After reviewing all of the circumstances and the relatively short time in which it is proposed the judgment be satisfied I have concluded, somewhat reluctantly, that I should grant the order.
It will be granted on the basis outlined in the proposed settlement commencing with a payment to be made within seven days which would have been paid November 1, 2000.","The accused was charged with impaired driving and driving over.
08. The sole issue to be determined was whether the accused was the person operating the vehicle at the time of the stop.
The police testified that they had walked through the bar before closing time and then returned to the bar at closing time.
The evidence was that the accused had been seen playing drinking games in the bar.
The police observed the people they had seen in the bar get into a truck and back up.
The police activated their emergency equipment and approached the vehicle.
The accused was sitting in the driver's seat when the police approached the vehicle.
The defence suggested that another individual had been driving the truck when it backed up but had gone inside the bar to purchase off sale before the police approached the truck.
HELD: The accused was convicted of both counts and a judicial stay was entered on the impaired driving count.
The Court found that the evidence of the accused was unreliable as a result of her alcohol consumption on the offence date.
The evidence of the person that the defence suggested was the driver was inconsistent and caused the Court concern about its reliability.
The Court found that at the time the individuals got into the truck, the accused was behind the wheel and that she was the one who backed the vehicle up and pulled it forward.
The keys were in the vehicle and it was running when the police came to the driver's door.
The accused's blood alcohol content at the time of driving as shown by the Certificate of Analysis was 150 milligrams of alcohol in 100 millilitres of blood.","[0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 7, 10, 11, 9]"

04166 J.C.P.A.
May 28, 1998[1] The parties were married May 5, 1973 and separated January 4, 1992.
The husband petitioned for divorce and other corollary relief on June 19, 1992.
The wife (applicant herein) counter-petitioned on March 22, 1993 and included in her claim a ""lump sum and periodic spousal support"".
[2] The matter proceeded from there and it is apparent that the parties negotiated a settlement of all of the outstanding issues in the dispute including divorce, custody of the children, division of matrimonial property, and spousal support payable by the husband to the applicant.
An Interspousal Contract dated July 21, 1993 was entered into by the parties which includes the following provisions relevant to this dispute:1.
In the preamble the agreement reads:D. The Parties to this agreement wish to divide their marital property and settle the outstanding issues between them.
2.
[3] The parties both acknowledged that they were aware of the nature and effect of the Interspousal Contract and each had independent legal advice before the agreement was signed.
[4] Subsequently, the clause with respect to spousal support above noted was incorporated, apparently by consent of the parties, into the judgment of the Court which was dated November 26, 1993.","The accused was found guilty on a charge of assaulting a police officer contrary to s. 270.01(1) of the Criminal Code.
The Crown applied under s. 752.1(1) for an order remanding the accused for an assessment by an expert for use as evidence in an application to have the accused declared a dangerous offender.
The defence opposed the application on the basis that the predicate offence was not a serious personal injury offence and it was not within the realm of possibility that the accused could be found to be a dangerous offender.
The accused was 50 years old.
He had a criminal record commencing in 1976 which included 58 Criminal Code convictions.
Fifteen of his prior convictions were for violent offences and six related to police officers.
He had violated mandatory supervision orders on three separate occasions and had breached a conditional sentence order.
The crimes of violence on his record involved the use of a weapon on more then one occasion.
The facts of the predicate offence involved swinging a branch at a police officer.
The officer had tasered the accused, but it had no effect.
The accused grabbed a branch and swung it in sufficient proximity to cause the officer to back up, drop his taser and draw his sidearm.
The officer provided a victim impact statement outlining the fear he experienced and the psychological impact the offence had on himself and his family.
HELD: The offence is a serious personal injury offence as defined in s. 752.
The accused picked up the branch with the intention of using it against the officer and it was of sufficient size that if the accused had struck the officer it would have caused serious damage.
The accused's actions were found to have endangered or been likely to endanger the officer's life or safety and to have inflicted or been likely to inflict severe psychological damage.
Given the number and nature of violent offences on the accused's record, the fact that many of the offences involve violence against police officers and the accused's prolonged issues with alcohol, a pattern of behaviour has been established.
The best predictor of future behaviour is past behaviour and there is likelihood that the accused will cause injury in the future.
The accused has demonstrated indifference to the reasonably foreseeable consequences to other persons of his behaviour.
Given the serious nature of the offence and the accused's prior record for similar offences, a sentence of two years or more is possible.
 It is not beyond the realm of possibility that the accused could be found to be a dangerous offender.
The assessment under s. 752.1 was ordered.","[1, 0, 2, 6, 4, 8, 5, 9, 7, 10, 13, 14]"

LEPAGE - for the respondentFIAT MCINTYRE, J.AUGUST 2, 1996The petitioner seeks interim custody of his son Stefan.
The respondent takes the position:1.
The petition for divorce is a nullity and Saskatchewan courts do not have jurisdiction to hear and determine the divorce proceedings;2.
The court lacks, or ought to decline to exercise jurisdiction under The Children's Law Act, R.S.S.
1990, c.C-8.1;3.
If the court accepts and exercises jurisdiction under The Children's Law Act interim custody should be granted to the respondent.
THE DIVORCE ACTThe petition was filed May 31, 1996.
In it the petitioner said he had only been resident in Saskatchewan since April 30, 1996.
Section 3 of the Divorce Act requires either spouse to have been ordinarily resident in the province for at least one year immediately preceding the commencement of the proceeding.
I find that the court does not have jurisdiction under the Divorce Act.
For the purpose of section 15(1)(a) one must look to section (2).","The Crown appealed the respondent's acquittal on a charge of driving over .08.
The Crown alleged that the trial judge erred in law by excluding two breath samples taken following the respondent's arrest on the basis that they were obtained in violation of s. 8 of the Charter of Rights.
During trial, the defence gave verbal notice of a Charter issue but did not elect to seek a voir dire or called any evidence in support of the Charter application and did not call any witnesses for the defence.
HELD: The Crown's appeal was granted and a verdict of guilty to driving over .08 was entered.
The Court elected to impose sentence and remained seized with the matter.
The trial judge failed to consider the totality of the circumstances in determining whether the officer had reasonable and probable grounds to make a breath demand.
The trial judge erred in finding the officer's subjective belief in impairment was not supported by the facts.
The Certificate of Analysis was admitted as a full exhibit and became part of the Crown's case.
The Crown had proven the offence beyond a reasonable doubt in all respects.","[0, 2, 4, 5, 3, 6, 7, 1, 8, 9, 12, 14, 11, 10]"

At this time the one defendant, The Dow Chemical Company, seeks a declaration that this Court lacks jurisdiction to entertain the action insofar as it relates to that particular defendant.
The Court is also asked to set aside the service ex juris.
I have concluded that the requested relief should not be granted.
The FactsFor the purpose of this application I assume that all the allegations in the statement of claim are true and that they do form the basis of a good cause of action in both tort and contract.
These are the circumstances of the plaintiff.
The plaintiff presently suffers from fibromyalgia, chronic fatigue and a persistent immune mediated skin rash on her chest.
It is further alleged that her condition was caused by negligence attributed to the manufacturers of the breast implants.
Four of the defendants are American corporations with their respective head offices in the United States of America.
To ensure that there was no uncertainty about its status and sphere of business activity, an affidavit was filed on behalf of the defendant, The Dow Chemical Company, setting forth the following.","Rule 77.03 – Liability for costsThe court found in favor of the respondents after a half-day chambers hearing.
They sought solicitor-client costs or costs under Tariff C, with a multiplier of four for a total of $12,000 given the applicants' conduct and their failure to include important information in their claim.
Held, party-and-party costs of $6,000 awarded to the respondents, using Tariff C and a multiplier of two.
This matter was sufficiently complex and important to the parties that it required significant preparation and effort to prepare/review the evidence and conduct the hearing.
While they did omit relevant information, the applicants' conduct wasn't so outrageous, scandalous or reprehensible that it warranted an award of solicitor-client costs.
The dispute was acrimonious, but the litigation was generally conducted in a civil manner.","[1, 0, 8, 5, 4, 7, 6, 3, 12, 14, 15, 17]"

Kowalishen for Jeffrey James South and Karen Joan RilkoffFIAT MATHESON J. September 22, 1997 The plaintiffs have applied for an order, pursuant to Queen's Bench Rule 173, striking out the statement of defence and counterclaim of Jeffrey James South and Karen Joan Rilkoff (the defendants) and the separate statement of defence of Helen Rilkoff.
It has been asserted that the issues raised in the defendants statement of defence, and in the statement of defence of Helen Rilkoff, do not disclose a reasonable defence, nor do the issues in the counterclaim show a reasonable cause of action.
The plaintiffs have also alleged that paragraphs 6, 7 and 8 of the defendants statement of defence, which are incorporated into paragraph 10 of the counterclaim, raise issues which have been dealt with in a final decision of a court of competent jurisdiction and the defendants are therefore barred by the doctrine of res judicata, or issue estoppel, from pursuing such issues.
Consequently, it has been asserted that the raising of such issues is an abuse of the process of the court.
Finally, it has been submitted that the defendants statement of defence and counterclaim are frivolous, vexatious and otherwise an abuse of the process of the court.","Rule 77.01 – Scope of Rule 77
This is a costs decision following litigation between the mother and father regarding apportionment of custody and access rights, quantification of child support and special expenses for the parties' children.
The mother was the successful party and income was imputed by the court to the respondent.
 Held, costs in the amount of $3,000 are awarded against the father.
The father's position caused unnecessary time, effort and delay.
The court referenced L. (N.D.) v. L. (M.S.) (2010) to summarize the principles and case law relevant to determining a cost award under Rule 77.
Determining costs in a matrimonial manner is more complex given mixed outcomes and the burden of costs placed on families and children such that the court may need to exercise discretion and move away from a strict application on tariffs.","[0, 1, 5, 4, 7, 3, 8, 6]"

Registrar '","The appellant appealed his conviction for sexual assault using a weapon and his sentence of eight years.
The appellant contended that his counsel had failed to call the complainant's boyfriend as a witness even though he was in the courthouse under a defence subpoena.
The appellant also raised on appeal the fact that he had lost his right to a jury trial.
He had failed to appear at the jury trial scheduled and a bench warrant had been issued.
The Crown had then applied for an order that the appellant was no longer entitled to a jury trial and the record showed that his counsel had agreed to forfeit the right to a jury trial.
The appellant contended that his counsel and the Crown both advised him he had lost his right by failing to appear and that he was not told that he could avoid losing his right if he had a legitimate excuse for failing to appear.
He put forth the excuse of having had no counsel at the time of the trial.
Dismissing the appeal,
(1) that there was nothing to show that the witness would have given relevant evidence bearing on a decisive issue in the trial and the appellant failed to meet the burden of showing that the evidence, if believed, could reasonably have been expected to affect the result of the trial when considered with all the other evidence; counsel's decision not to call the witness where the witness was hostile and counsel did not know what he would say was not inappropriate, and, the court noted, in the circumstances, seemed to have been the right decision; (2) the excuse of failing to appear because he did not have counsel was not a legitimate excuse within the meaning of s. 598(1)(a) of the Criminal Code; moreover, the appellant only raised this issue in his oral submissions and gave no notice to the Crown respecting this issue nor did he provide any supporting evidence by way of affidavit; it was seen by the Court as another unsupported and unjustified criticism of counsel and the Court concluded that the record showed that the appellant had agreed to forfeit his right to a jury trial; and (3) that an eight year sentence, although at the high end of the scale for sexual assault, was not manifestly excessive, having regard to deterrence, the circumstances of the offence, and the appellant's record which included three minor offences.","[0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5]"

(orally)[1] We do not need to hear from counsel for the respondent.
I mentioned during the opening of this appeal that members of the panel had followed the usual practice of carefully reviewing the trial record and written arguments before this hearing.
[2] We are all of the view that there is no basis to interfere with the decision of Mr. Justice Smith.
As his extensive reasons for decision disclose he addressed the matter thoroughly.
[3] This was a difficult case in which the trial judge was required to carefully address the competing claims for custody, but mindful of the “best interests of the child”.
Throughout the trial and in his reasons the learned trial judge focussed on this predominant issue.","After an argument with his girlfriend, the appellant drove his car at high speed with the lights off, running two stop signs.
At the second intersection he collided with another vehicle, causing serious injury to three people.
He pleaded guilty to three counts of dangerous driving causing bodily harm; the Crown proposed an intermittent sentence, but the judge sentenced him to nine months incarceration concurrent on each count plus two years probation with conditions.
The appellant appealed on the grounds the judge failed to consider the Crown's recommendation, failed to sufficiently state his reasons, and the sentence was excessive.
Dismissing the appeal,
that the sentencing power of a judge is not limited by Crown submissions, that the failure to state every reason does not constitute and error, and that in view of the appellant's record and other factors, the sentence was not excessive to the point of constituting a reversible error.","[1, 0, 2, 4, 5, 3, 6, 7, 8, 9]"

for CNH Capital Canada Ltd. and CNH Canada Ltd. and Sonia L. EggermanJUDGMENT KOCH J. December 31, 2009 [1] Beginning in the 1990s and leading up to February 2007, Wheatland Industries (1990) Ltd. (“Wheatland”) carried on business as a farm equipment dealer at separate locations at Rosetown, Saskatchewan, and Elrose, Saskatchewan.
Wheatland entered into dealership agreements with equipment suppliers, including New Holland Canada, Ltd./ Ltée, Case Canada Corporation and Flexi-Coil Ltd.
The respective financing corporations of each of the supplier corporations granted Wheatland lines of credit on the security of present and after‑acquired product inventory.
By 2003, the three suppliers mentioned had become part of CNH Canada Ltd. (“CNH Canada”).
Dealer financing for CNH Canada has been provided by CNH Capital Canada Ltd. (“CNH Capital”).
On April 13, 1999, TD registered its security interest with the Saskatchewan Personal Property Registry.
New Holland postponed its Wheatland security in favour of TD as to assets of Wheatland, other than NHCC Financed Collateral.
There may be a similar agreement involving Flexi‑Coil, but it has not been provided.
The existence and circumstances of the priority agreements are not contentious.","Saskatchewan Economic Development Corporation (SEDCO) made a business loan to Fladseth, but misspelled her name in its PPSA registration as Eladseth.
It also properly registered against her trade name, 'Joan E. Craft Supplies'.
After her assignment in bankruptcy, the trustee disallowed Sedco's security on the basis that its registration was defective.
Sedco appealed this decision under section 135 of the Bankruptcy Act.
ISSUES: 1)Did Sedco register its interest in accordance with the PPSA Regulations?
2)If not, can the registration be cured under section 66 of the PPSA?
HELD: 1)The personal registration did not comply with the PPSA Regulations.

After the weekly SGI disability benefits were terminated, the Bank Loans fell into default.
The Royal Bank reported the particulars of these loan defaults to Equifax Canada (""Equifax""), a credit reporting agency.
The Royal Bank requested a written assignment of those settlement proceeds, however, Mr. Compain declined to give an assignment.

May 19, 1998The Issue[1] Did the parties cohabit for more than 90 days and thereby vitiate their agreement to live separate and apart?
The Facts[2] The parties signed a contract described as a separation agreement dated September 6, 1996.
The agreement provided, among other things, that the parties would live separately and that neither would claim spousal support from the other.
[3] The following clause appears in the agreement:11.
NINETY-DAY TRIAL COHABITATIONIf at any future time, the Husband and the Wife, with their mutual consent, cohabit as Husband and Wife for a period or periods totaling not more than 90 days with reconciliation as the primary purpose of the cohabitation, the provisions contained in this Agreement will not be affected, except as provided in this clause.
[4] For the purposes of the trial, counsel proceeded on the basis that this instrument was a separation agreement.
I express no opinion as to the nature of the agreement in light of the narrow issue presented to me for determination.","The appellant Board granted the respondent temporary total disability benefits on a part-time basis.

The two issues to be determined are: (a) Were the respondent’s proceedings in respect to a proposed hotel development, including the subject bylaw, invalid by reason of bad faith?
(b) Has the respondent met the statutory prerequisites for a public meeting?
I have concluded that the requested relief should be granted in part.
THE FACTS[2] The respondent, the Town of Nipawin, is a community of some 5,000 people located in northeastern Saskatchewan.
To that end the Town Council has taken certain steps to bring the proposal to fruition.
These include a tentative sale of public lands and the introduction of Bylaw 756/99.
The applicants are opposed to the development and take exception to what has transpired to this point.
[4] The chronology of events begins in 1987.
The competing parties read the report differently.
The applicants say that it recommended no more than improving the quality of existing accommodation.
The respondent says that it recommended increased accommodation.
This report also suggested it would be advantageous to locate any such facility close to the Evergreen Centre.
This was done, but no developer came forward.","The respondent expropriated a parcel of land owned by the appellant.

The taxing master received expert opinion that a reasonable fee for the services, exclusive of taxation costs, would be $10,000.
He proceeded to tax the account at $14,000, disallowed any costs of the taxation hearing, and disallowed a claim for interest on interim accounts submitted by the solicitor.

[2] Firstly, we are in general agreement with the reasoning of Wright J.
Although his reasons are clear, there is some confusion as to the answers he gave to the questions posed in his judgment.
In an addendum, he said that the answer to question 4 should be no.
It seems clear that he was referring to question 5, rather than question 4.
The result is the same, in any event.

Upon that occurring, the Crown closed its case, and the sole defence witness was Mr. Kenny.
At the outset, I thank both counsel, and in particular Mr. Loewen and his client, for proceeding in this manner.
The net result is that there was a significant saving of Court time, and the case was able to be decided on a simplified and expeditious basis.
THE FACTS:[3] On September 14, 2007, officers of Saskatchewan Environment and Resources Management (“SERM”) were in a surveillance aircraft flying above the Fort `a la Corne Provincial Forest near Choiceland, Saskatchewan.
The SERM officers in the aircraft were in communication with SERM officers who were on patrol in vehicles on the ground, and those vehicles were guided towards the subject vehicle and pulled it over at 12:15 a.m.
Overall, then, this vehicle was under surveillance on a continuous and ongoing basis for approximately 30 minutes or so.
[4] In that vehicle were three individuals.","The plaintiff sued his father's estate for breach of a farm lease and for the value of his farm labour.
The estate counterclaimed for a mortgage debt incurred by the father on behalf of the plaintiff.
The plaintiff was not included in his father's Will as a beneficiary and the Will contained no reference to the mortgage debt.
The father's statement of assets filed in his divorce and matrimonial property action did not disclose it as an asset.
HELD: 1)The unsigned handwritten memorandum evidenced a binding agreement for lease between the plaintiff and his father.
He affirmed the lease in his discussions with a daughter.
2)The plaintiff neither repudiated the lease nor failed to complete his obligations under it. 
The fact that he did not vigorously contest the right of his brother to farm the land on behalf of the estate did not estop him from suing for damages for his father's breach of the lease. 
Damages of $6,500 were awarded.
3)The plaintiff failed to establish a quantum meruit claim.
He did not produce any documents to show he had been reimbursed for his labour on the farm in prior years.
Other family members helped with the farming from time to time.
He did nothing while his father was alive to demand or obtain payment.
4)Even if the mortgage was considered a debt in 1989 it was subsequently forgiven.
It was significant that the plaintiff was not included as a beneficiary and the amount of the mortgage was similar to the bequests to the other children.
5)The plaintiff was awarded his costs against the estate on a party and party basis for that portion of his claim on which he was successful and for defending the counterclaim.
Solicitor and client costs against the estate were not appropriate as the issues raised by the claim and counterclaim were not typical estate issues.

[4] It was further alleged that the acts of the defendant in injuring the plaintiff were criminal acts, and that he also committed the torts of assault, battery, trespass and intentional interference with the plaintiff.
The defendant did not defend the claim against him and was noted for default.

BASIS OF CLAIM[2] Mabel Zalys was the mother of the plaintiff and the defendant.
There were two other children: Brian and Wanda Paulmark.
[3] Bruce and Brian reside in Edmonton.
Wanda resides in Scarborough and Brenda resides near Yorkton, where the parents also resided.
[4] In 1992 Mabel placed $17,500.00 in a bank account in the name of Brenda.
Mabel added $8,000.00 to the account a few years later.
The sum of $500.00 from the account was given to Brenda.
Thus, the principal amount in the account was $25,000.00.
[5] Brenda has testified that Mabel told Brenda that she was to receive the interest earned on the bank account.

The Partnerships sustained heavy operating losses since 1989 and the petitioners had made large capital contributions on behalf of the defaulting partners in order to prevent the Partnerships from defaulting on the mortgages.
The defaulting partners obtained the benefits of business losses which they used to offset their other sources of income and to decrease their personal income tax liability by significant amounts, obtaining benefits without paying for them.
The petitioners alleged that Ashton had committed three acts of bankruptcy within the six months prior to filing the petition including ceasing to pay liabilities as they became due in failing to make payments to the petitioners, making a fraudulent conveyance to his wife and disposing of his property with intent to defraud or defeat his creditors by permitting his interest in the Securities to be purportedly seized by his wife.
HELD: A receiving order was granted.
1)No adequate explanation was offered by Ashton who was a wealthy individual for his failure to pay his partnership obligations.
It was common ground that Ashton had paid nothing toward his partnership obligations since 1993.
The defendant admitted that he was indebted to the petitioners in the amount of approximately $278,758 and that he had received substantial tax advantages as a result of his involvement in the two partnerships.
 2)The majority of the respondent's wealth consisted of the Securities purportedly seized by his wife in 1996.
The preservation order was continued for 30 days to permit the Trustee in Bankruptcy to determine whether the bankruptcy estate wished to challenge these transactions.","[0, 1, 2, 4, 5, 8, 6, 10, 9, 7, 11, 12, 13, 14, 16, 17, 15, 18]"

May 12, 1997I will confirm the provisional order but reduce the monthly child maintenance from $300.00 per month per child to $50.00 per month per child, for the following reasons:The respondent, Laurie Friesen, earns approximately $12,000.00 per year gross.
Based on the federal guidelines for Saskatchewan, she would be required to pay $142.00 per month to the father of the children, Cassandra and Anastasia.
However, the respondent has unusually high costs for exercising access, as she lives in Saskatoon, Saskatchewan and the former husband lives in Calgary, Alberta.
In light of that cost, I reduce the child maintenance to $100.00 per month, or $50.00 per month per child; commencing June 1, 1997.
J. '","The Minister of Social Services applied for an order that the Public Trustee be served with notice of a protection hearing and act as litigation guardian for H.B. who was alleged to be of unsound mind.
H.B.'s child born in 1995 was apprehended at birth and was currently subject of a child protection hearing.
The Minister relied on the Public Trustee Act and, alternatively, on the court's inherent parens patriae jurisdiction.HELD: The Public Trustee was appointed amicus curae to act on behalf of H.B. upon being satisfied she is unable to act for herself.
An assessment was ordered pursuant to s32 of the Child and Family Services Act.
The order was to issue unless the Public Trustee shows cause as to why it is not the appropriate party within 10 days from the date of this order.
1)While the wording of s32 is ambiguous the Public Trustee was correct that the Act does not authorize it to represent an adult under a mental disability other than where a property interest is involved.
Nowhere does the Act authorize the Public Trustee to act as personal guardian of a dependant or mentally incompetent adult.
The PT Act does not authorize its appointment as litigation guardian in the matter of child protection proceedings.
2)Pursuant to its parens patriae jurisdiction the Court has a responsibility to protect the interests of H.B. who requires independent representation to ensure her rights are protected.
If the court failed to intervene H.B. will be left in limbo, a victim of the system.","[0, 1, 2, 3, 5, 4, 6, 7, 8]"

This is an application of the Rosetown and District Community Bond Corporation to lift the stay which is the result of the appeal taken by Precision Metal Fabricating Ltd., Loren Katzenberger and Sheryl Katzenberger from the order of Kyle J. delivered July 11, 1996.
The order in question was made pursuant to s. 234 of The Business Corporations Act, S.S. 1979, c. B-10, as a result of a finding by the chambers judge that the conduct of the Board of Directors of Precision Metal Fabricating Ltd. had been high-handed and oppressive entitling the Rosetown and District Community Bond Corporation to relief.
The relief that was provided may well have been entirely appropriate, but it could have the effect of removing control of the said Precision Metal Fabricating Ltd. from Loren Katzenberger and Sheryl Katzenberger who are its present and long-time majority shareholders.","The applicant sought approval of the Court for a settlement reached on behalf of the infant plaintiff, who had been injured in an automobile accident.
Part of the order sought provided for the payment of solicitor fees by way of a contingency fee agreement negotiated with the applicant.

The applicant was convicted in July of 1997 of several offences, consisting in the main of sexual offences involving members of his family and others close to him.
In consequence he was sentenced to five years in prison.
He then appealed against his convictions, and the Crown appealed against his sentence.
On September 16, 1998, this Court dismissed his appeal against conviction.
At the same time it allowed the Crown's appeal, in effect increasing the sentence from five to ten years.
Throughout, the applicant was represented by senior counsel, Mr. S. Halyk Q.C.
The applicant decided not to seek leave to appeal to the Supreme of Canada on the advice of Mr. Halyk and then on the further advice of Dean MacKinnon.
Some two years later he changed his mind and applied to the Supreme Court for an extension of time to apply for leave and for leave to appeal, raising some grounds of appeal for the first time.","FIAT.

March 9, 2000 [1] Mary Jane Herman, as guardian of three infant children of a deceased single mother has appealed the decision of Saskatchewan Government Insurance that the children are not entitled to any additional benefits.
The sole issue before the court is whether any additional dependant child care benefits are payable under s. 146(5) of The Automobile Accident Insurance Act, R.S.S.
1978, c.A-35 when the deceased victim was unemployed and had no income at the time of the fatal motor vehicle accident.
FACTS[2] The facts have been agreed upon by the parties and may be briefly stated.
On that date she was involved in a motor vehicle accident and suffered injuries which resulted in her death.
[3] As there was no surviving spouse the children are entitled to any benefits payable under s.146(5) of the Act.
[4] SGI paid to the Public Trustee for the children the sum of $47,427.00 being the minimum death benefit pursuant to s. 146(3).","FIAT. SaskPower sought an order pursuant to Queen's Bench Rule 547 to require the plaintiffs to post security for costs on the ground Wind Power was a non-resident plaintiff with little or no assets in the province of Saskatchewan.
HELD: The motion was dismissed.
 1)Rule 547 is limited to cases where the plaintiff is a non-resident or where the defendant is given a statutory right to apply.
Wind Power is an Alberta company extra-provincially registered in Saskatchewan.
Dove Industries, a Saskatchewan company incorporated specifically to develop a pilot project in Saskatchewan which did not proceed, had shareholders in the province. 2)Given the amount of the claim against SaskPower in the amount of $6,400,000 and the significant claim for costs in excess of $50,000 the Court would have granted the security for costs but for the delay by SaskPower in bringing its application.
The action was commenced in April 1996.
Unexplained delay by a defendant in seeking security for costs will prevent the grant of an order.
To make an award for security for costs at this stage would place a burden on the plaintiffs and possibly prevent the action from taking place at the scheduled time.
 3)The plaintiff was awarded one set of costs in any event of the cause.","[0, 1, 2, 5, 4, 3, 7, 6, 12, 9, 13]"

M. on or about the 7th day of September, 1992 did while her ability to operate a motor vehicle was impaired by alcohol or a drug operate a motor vehicle, contrary to Section 253(a) of the Criminal Code.
The appellant appeals from the conviction.
As to the second ground of appeal, the trial judge at p. 281 of the transcript said:The youth is also charged under count one with driving while impaired on the date in question.
As I pointed out to Counsel at the conclusion of the trial, there is a recent decision from the Ontario Court of Appeal dated January 7th, 1993, namely, The Queen vs. Stellato in regards to the standard of proof required for a conviction on a charge of impaired driving.
In particular, the case deals with whether or not a ""marked departure from what is usually considered as the norm"" is required for a conviction.
The expression marked departure comes from the case The Queen vs. McKenzie, 1955, 111 Canadian Criminal Cases, Page 317.
It has been used extensively in cases since that date.","An appeal from an order varying a child maintenance order which had been based on a written agreement between the parties entered into a week before the Federal Child Support Guidelines came into effect.
The application to vary made about a year later was based mainly on the coming into effect of the guidelines.
The decision to not to allow evidence on all issues because of conflicting affidavits gave rise to the first ground of appeal.
The appellant also argued that the judge erred in finding that an order to vary would not be inequitable within the meaning of s.17(6.2) by reason of the terms of the written agreement and resulting order which contained special provisions to benefit the children.
He also objected to the s.7(1)(f) order for $230 per month for extraordinary extracurricular expenses.
HELD: The appeal was dismissed with the exception of the payments under s.7(1)(f) which were set aside.

.

did operate a motor vehicle while his ability to operate the vehicle was impaired by alcohol and/or a drug contrary to Section 253(a) and Section 255 of the Criminal Code.
The powers of this Court on this appeal are set forth in ss.
686(1)(a) of the Criminal Code:686.
.
.
.
The notice of appeal cites six grounds, one of them an alleged violation of the Charter.
There is an added catch all ""any other grounds that may appear from a reading of the transcript"".
There is no mention in the notice of appeal, at least in the language of the section, of any of the grounds set out in ss.
686(1)(a).
However at the opening of argument the appellant abandoned all but the Charter matter and one involving the ""principle of reasonable doubt"".
The Charter allegation reads:.","Two female employees filed complaints with the Saskatchewan Human Rights Commission alleging sexual harassment and discrimination contrary to the Saskatchewan Human Rights Code.
The unionized employer applied for judicial review in the nature of prohibition contending the provisions of the Code were superseded by the collective agreement and s.25 of the Trade Union with the result that the Board of Inquiry lacked jurisdiction to hear the complaint.
The chambers judge found the Act took precedence over the Code on the basis that the Act dealt specifically with the employment relationship and granted an order prohibiting the Board of Inquiry from hearing and determining the matter.
Sub-questions to be determined included: what are the statutory schemes of the Trade Union Act and the Saskatchewan Human Rights Code; what has the Supreme of Canada decided about the exclusive jurisdiction of an arbitrator to resolve disputes in the context of labour law; the essential character of the dispute and ambit of the collective agreement; whether either the Code or the Act has exclusive jurisdiction to decide the dispute and if not, which statute takes priority or is paramount.
HELD: The order of the Court of Queen's Bench was set aside and the matter was remitted to the Board of Inquiry appointed under the provisions of the Code.
1)The chambers judge correctly decided that the issue in this case is confined to a determination of the correct forum in which to bring the complaint of sexual harassment.
2)Human rights are fundamental, quasi-constitutional rights which embody fundamental values and public policy.
Because human rights are not private rights, but public rights which constitute fundamental public policy, parties are not able to contract out of, alter, amend, or repeal or create exceptions to human rights provisions.
To do otherwise would permit the denigration of the rights and obviate the protection of the rights the statute seeks to protect.
3)The mere fact that a collective agreement includes an article or clause which complies with the Code or a provision which covenants not to discriminate on the basis of the grounds set out in the Code, does not in and of itself transform the nature of the dispute from a human rights violation to a breach of the collective agreement.
The ambit of the collective agreement does not affect the finding that the essential nature of the dispute is a human rights violation particularly when the public interest component and wide powers granted under the Code to redress a violation are taken into account.
It is not in its essential character a complaint arising out of the employment relationship under the collective agreement.
 4)The Commission was awarded its costs on double column V in this Court and on the appropriate Court of Queen's Bench tariff.
No costs were requested by the intervenor.ADDENDUM: Paragraphs number 25 and 31 are substituted as follows: [25]
This position was reinforced by Weber v. Ontario Hydro and New Brunswick v. O'Leary.
The policy driving such decisions is that the dispute resolution process, established by the various labour statutes, should not be duplicated or undermined by concurrent common law actions in the courts.
This also conforms to the theory of deference that courts accord decisions of specialized tribunals.
For a complete discussion of the issue see Parr and Prince Albert District Health Board v. Saskatchewan Federation of Labour released concurrently with this judgment.
The Ambit of the Collective Agreement [31]
One must not lose sight of the fact that the terms of the collective agreement itself can play an important role in the determination of whether the jurisdiction of the court has been ousted in favour of an arbitrator.
The fact that parties have included an anti-discrimination clause in the collective agreement does not alter the fundamental nature of the dispute or have the effect of extending the scope of the arbitrator's jurisdiction.
It may play a role in determining whether the statutory tribunal would decide to hear the complaint, but it cannot affect the determination of the essential nature of the dispute or the question of jurisdiction.
The essential issue is whether this complaint is a dispute between the parties with respect to the meaning, application or alleged violation of the collective agreement.
To find that it is, with the result that the dispute must be arbitrated, would permit the parties to contract out of the Code, something they cannot do.","[1, 0, 2, 4, 6, 9, 10, 7, 3, 12, 8, 13, 16, 5, 14, 17, 18, 15, 20, 19]"

The trial judge prevented the cross-examination of the complainant in relation to a previous allegation she had made relating to this sexual assault.
The offence is alleged to have taken place at home of the appellant's brother.
The appellant was asked by his brother and sister-in-law to babysit their daughter.
The allegation was that the appellant had entered her parent's bedroom where she was sleeping and sexually assaulted her.
The appellant, who has no previous record, was convicted of the charge and sentenced to three years imprisonment.
The appellant during cross-examination of the complainant attempted to question her regarding a previous allegation regarding the same sexual assault against another person.
The trial judge did not permit this line of questioning as he held it pertained to her past sexual history.
HELD: Appeal allowed.
The failure of the trial judge to allow this cross-examination has prevented the appellant from having a fair trial as he has been denied the opportunity to make full answer and defence.
It seems the question that should have been put to the trial judge on this occasion was whether this section was applicable to a situation involving non-consensual sex.
The complainant was not being questioned about her consensual sexual activities but rather a previous complainant of a sexual assault.
It is understood the intent was to indicate the complainant had implicated someone else as the assailant and after investigation the complaint had not been acted upon.
That evidence could have placed in doubt the reliability of the complainant's identification of the person who assaulted her since the room was dark when the assault was alleged to have occurred.
The relevance of such a question pertaining to the existence of another complaint made by the complainant in respect of the same assault is obvious.
That question has a direct bearing on her credibility.","[0, 1, 3, 5, 9, 8, 11, 6, 12, 15, 14, 24, 19, 18, 25, 7, 16]"

HISTORY OF PROCEEDINGS[3] The following dates are relevant to this application: (a) July 4, 2003 - the accused was arrested, released on an undertaking with conditions, and given a Promise to Appear in court in La Loche on July 31, 2003; (b) July 14, 2003 - the Information was sworn charging the accused; (c) July 31, 2003 - the accused first appeared in court.","A provisional order from the Alberta Court of Queen's Bench required the respondent to pay monthly support based on his income of $55,000 for the couple's two children.
He was also required to pay half of the monthly dental expenses.
Subsequently, the respondent filed a financial statement showing his income to be $50,064.
HELD: The respondent's monthly child support payments are reduced according to the guidelines.
The respondent is also required to maintain health and dental insurance for his children through his employer.
The Court instructed the respondent on the procedure for submitting the children's health insurance claims.
The provisional order was confirmed subject to these specified variations.","[2, 1, 5, 3, 4, 7, 8, 0]"
183,"At the outset herein, the Crown entered a stay of proceedings on the other count on the Information, which alleged impaired operation of a motor vehicle, contrary to s. 253(1)(a) of the Criminal Code.
[2] By letter dated June 28, 2010, the accused had also given notice that he is seeking an order excluding evidence, pursuant to s. 24 of the Charter.
He had alleged in that regard, a breach of his rights to counsel of choice under s. 10(b) of the Charter.
As well, he had claimed that his rights under ss.
8 and 9 of the Charter against unreasonable search or seizure, and not to be arbitrarily detained had been breached.
Therefore, we proceeded on a voir dire in respect to those matters and the evidence was applied to the trial proper.
At the conclusion of the voir dire evidence, the accused abandoned his Charter application under ss.
8 and 9 thereof.
Related to that issue, the Court must also determine whether the Crown has met any onus on it to establish that the accused had waived his rights to counsel.
As well the accused had indicated he had consumed alcohol.
[5] Therefore the officer read the accused his rights to counsel.
After the second reading, the accused responded “Yep” that he did understand.","The applicant sought an Order quashing a decision of the Office of the Rentalsman pursuant to Queen's Bench Rule 664(1) and 674.
The respondent raised a preliminary objection, arguing that the matter should not proceed by way of judicial review but that the applicant should be restricted to an appeal of the Rentalsman's decision under s.49(1) of the Residential Tenancies Act, and that the applicant had failed to do so within the prescribed 30 day limit.
The applicant argued that she never received any notice of proceedings making it impossible for her to appeal within 30 days.
HELD: Preliminary objection dismissed.
The court ordered that the application be returned to the Chamber's list for a hearing on the merits.
Since there is nothing in the Act that allows the court to extend the time for filing an appeal, to deny the application for judicial review would deny the applicant an opportunity to pursue her only remedy in the circumstances.","[8, 5, 6, 3, 21, 9, 7, 4, 16, 2, 24, 11]"

January 23, 2007 [1] Lester Favel (the “accused”) brings an application pursuant to s. 520 of the Criminal Code for a review of the order denying him judicial interim release.
Mr. Favel previously entered guilty pleas to a number of offences which include assault on Santana Stonechild, break and enter a residence, assault on Tamara Michiskinic, and four charges of breach of undertaking.
Mr. Favel received a conditional sentence on these charges April 12, 2006 and the Crown alleges that Mr. Favel has breached the conditions imposed at that time.
Pursuant to s. 742.6 of the Criminal Code this places the onus on Mr. Favel to show cause why his detention in custody is not justified.
[2] In addition, Mr. Favel is facing new charges.
He is charged that he did on or about September 15, 2006 assault Juanita Sunshine.
He was originally released on that charge on October 2, 2006, but failed to appear in court as required to do on October 16, 2006.","One of the residual legatees of the respondent estate filed a petition under s. 31(1) of the Probate Act.
At the hearing on the application, the executor, under cross-examination, admitted that he had 'done a disservice to the estate' and that his actions were a 'perfect example of why executors shouldn't have done what I have done.'
The Chambers judge found that the executor converted estate funds to his own use and ordered the appellant to post security pursuant to the Act.
The executor appealed.
He submitted that the Court had not explicitly determined that he had committed waste, and accordingly there was no basis or foundation for an order requiring him to post security.
Dismissing the appeal,
that the appellant's own admissions under oath were sufficient bases for the Court's finding.
This was also one of those rare occasions where solicitor and client costs on the appeal were warranted, as the executor's actions amounted to a serious dereliction of duty which the Court termed reprehensible and unconscionable.","[0, 3, 4, 2, 5, 6, 1, 7]"

[T.C.M.]","An action for payments owing on vehicles leased by Standard from Redhead and for parts and labour supplied by Redhead to the leased vehicles.
At issue was whether Hyndman had an obligation in contract or equity for the lease payments and repairs from September 1993 until February 1994 based on discussions in 1993.
There was no correspondence between the parties confirming the terms of the agreement.
It was agreed that the discussions concerned the fact that Standard was not solvent at that date and that Hyndman entered an arrangement with Standard to operate under Hyndman's authority; Hyndman would make payments but would not agree to having the leases assigned to them.
In issue was for how long the lease payments were to continue and on what conditions.
HELD: The action against Hyndman was dismissed with taxable costs.
Standard did not enter a defence to Redhead's claim and had been noted in default.
Judgment was entered against Standard for $63,267.49 for the outstanding lease payments and parts and service account plus pre-judgment interest calculated from March 1994 to the date of judgment pursuant to the Pre-judgment Interest Act.
1)Redhead's claim against Hyndman was dismissed as there was no contractual relationship between the companies respecting the lease payments.
Any verbal arrangement was never verified.
It was clear that Hyndman refused to assume the obligations on the leases; that Redhead knew of the risk because of Standard's insolvency and was prepared to take that risk.
2)The facts did not establish appropriate circumstances for an award based on either quantum meruit or unjust enrichment.
The actions taken were for the benefit of Standard in an attempt to keep it operational.
 3)The claim against Hyndman for unpaid repairs was not proven.
Hyndman did make some payments on behalf of Standard for repairs although there was no specific contract to do so.
 It was not established that the accounts were forwarded, that Hyndman had notice of the unpaid invoices or issued a purchase order number authorizing the repairs.
Hyndman gave notice to Redhead that they would not be obligated for repairs without a purchase order number.","[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 7, 6, 9, 0, 10, 8, 11, 12, 16, 14, 17, 15, 19, 20, 21, 22, 18, 24, 25, 23, 28, 26, 27, 31, 32, 34, 36, 33]"
186,"TUCKER, J 1.
The accused is charged with the offence of aggravated assault on Victor McKay on February 21, 2008.
At the trial, Crown counsel called six witnesses to testify, and, during the course of the evidence of the sixth witness, requested that the court enter into a voir dire.
2.
The remedies sought were, firstly, a stay of proceedings regarding the charges before the court, or, in the alternative, the exclusion of evidence obtained from the accused while he was being held in detention at the Saskatoon Police Service building.
3.
By agreement of counsel, all of the evidence taken on the trial proper was made applicable to the voir dire.
Crown and defence counsel agreed that the Crown would call the witnesses on the voir dire, thus giving defence the opportunity to cross-examine them.
The Crown called three witnesses on the voir dire, those being Constable Epp, Sergeant Huisman, and Sergeant Johnson, all of the Saskatoon Police Service.
The defence did not call any witnesses on the voir dire.
4.
The evidence on the voir dire indicated that on February 21, 2008, Constable Epp was directed to 2112 Main Street East in Saskatoon because of a complaint of a disturbance.
She was in uniform, in a marked patrol car, operating alone.
That apartment was occupied by the accused.","The plaintiffs claim for crop damage caused by the defendant's cattle entering the plaintiff's canola field.
The defendant denies he is responsible or negligent, but admits his cattle were in the field.HELD:
Damages were awarded in the amount of $2,533.45.
The court valued the loss at $3,052.36.
It then deducted 2% attributed to wild animal damage, 5% for the plaintiffs failure to calculate actual yield from the rest of the crop, 5% that the plaintiffs would have paid in dockage and 5% for the cost of production.
Civil liability for crop damage caused by cattle flows from the Stray Animals Act.
A cattle owner is strictly liable for damages caused by his straying cattle. 
This liability may possibly even be absolute and only an act of god may serve as a defence.
The issue here is the quantum of the damage.
The fact that the defendant was refused access to the plaintiff's property to repair the fence has no bearing on liability in this case.
An independent adjuster assessed the damage at 557 bushels.
The court found on the facts that the damage was caused exclusively by the defendant's cattle on several occasions.","[2, 4, 9, 12, 1, 5, 7, 8, 18, 11, 10, 13, 15, 14]"
187,"[2] The trial of this matter evolved over an extended period of time.
Defence eventually called no evidence and the matter proceeded to closing arguments.
2) Did the police officer have reasonable and probable grounds for making a blood sample demand pursuant to s. 254(3)(b) of the Code?
3) Was the demand pursuant to s. 254(3) made “forthwith or as soon as practicable” as contemplated by the Criminal Code?
4) Were the accused’s s. 10(b) Charter rights to counsel infringed?
5) If any of the above issues are determined in favour of the accused, should the court grant the remedy of exclusion of the Certificate of Analysis as requested by the defence?
Facts[4] The following is a summary of the evidence forthcoming from the witnesses.
[5] At about 3 a.m. on January 23, 2004, while driving home, D.R.
came across a vehicle facing north in the west ditch of Boychuk Drive and Briarwood Road in the City of Saskatoon.
D.R.
The accused was the lone occupant, seated in the driver’s seat, with his seat belt on.
The headlights of the vehicle were on and D.R.
D.R.
felt the accused was at first unconscious, but regained consciousness.
The accused cursed at D.R., told D.R.
[6] R.W., a paramedic with M.D.","The accused was charged with operating a motor vehicle while impaired contrary to s.255(1) and s.253(a) of the Criminal Code and with having consumed alcohol in such a quantity that his blood alcohol concentration exceeded .08 contrary to s.253(b) and s.255(1).
The accused contended his right to be secure against unreasonable search and seizure as guaranteed by s.8 of the Charter and his right not to be arbitrarily detained or imprisoned as guaranteed by s.9 of the Charter were breached.
In issue was whether the RCMP officer had the jurisdiction to carry out his duties as a peace officer in the City of Prince Albert; if so, was he acting in the lawful execution of his duties in conducting random stop.
HELD: The accused was found guilty of driving with a blood alcohol level greater than .08.
A judicial stay was entered in relation to the impaired count on which he would have been found guilty if it were necessary.
1)The language used by Parliament in the Royal Mounted Police Act is clear, broad and unambiguous as it was their obvious intention to create a police force that operates without jurisdictional barriers throughout the entire country of Canada.
When there is a limitation on their duties it is clearly stated.
The Police Act does not mention any exclusivity between one force and another.
Given the ultra vires statute construction doctrine it would not be appropriate for provincial legislation to take away powers given by the Federal legislation.
The Police Act must be read in context as providing a manner of funding policing not a manner of taking away jurisdiction granted to RCMP officers.
2)The law is now clear that the police can detain vehicles as long as they do so for the purposes of checking for sobriety, licences, ownership, insurance and other mechanical fitness of motor vehicles.
The R. v. Emke decision is outdated.
3)The officer was acting in the lawful execution of his duty.
There was no breach of the accused's rights under the Charter.","[3, 5, 9, 11, 8, 12, 7, 14, 16, 10, 17, 23, 22, 21, 27, 13]"

JUDGMENT [1] Mr. Toupin is charged that, on or about the 21st day of August, A.D. 2003, at or near[…], Saskatchewan, he did commit a sexual assault on T.D.
contrary to section 271 of the Criminal Code.
The Crown elected to proceed summarily.
The Facts[2] Ms. T.D.
was employed as a clerk at the Provincial Court Building on [...].
She assumed her duties in 1998 and although she testified that she knew of the accused in 1999, it is much more likely that she met him in the spring of 2002 after he had assumed his duties as a Justice of the Peace in the same building.
Considerable joking and teasing frequently took place amongst all of these persons.
I believe that many of the jokes that passed between the men and women, both verbal and written, frequently had sexual connotations to them and some were explicitly sexual in nature.
[4] From the evidence that I have heard, it appears that personal information was also exchanged amongst the staff members.
T.D.
told the accused that she had been a member of the R.C.M.P.
Even a man who the complainant had known for a long time made comments to her that embarrassed her.
said that she could take a joke but there was a limit.","FIAT. The numbered company applied for relief pursuant to the Queen's Bench Act s.81(1) allowing the court to direct the judgment to be paid by installments.
The creditor objected that the applicant had plenty of opportunity over the years to pay and drew attention to prior allegations of mismanagement or redirection of funds which should have been allocated to the payment of interest.
HELD: The payment which should have been paid in November was to be paid within 7 days.
The remaining payments set out in the schedule will commence January 2001 with the change in rate of interest from that provided under the Interest Act to one equivalent to pre-judgment interest.
A 5 day grace period was allowed after which the respondent was allowed to proceed immediately with enforcement by execution, garnishment or any means it deems appropriate.
The taxed cost of this application was added to the judgment and will be part of the balance to be paid on May 1, 2001.

[2] As there was no evidence before the Court of the undertaking alleged in Counts 1 and 2, the accused is not guilty of those two charges.
FACTS The evidence with respect to Counts 3 and 4 is as follows: [3] The accused had been drinking alcoholic beverages at a house party which ended in the early morning.
She had her last beer at approximately 7:45 a.m. She went to the 711 convenience store with friends as a passenger in a half ton truck.
In the preceding hour, the accused testified that she probably had three or four beer.
She was feeling “okay”, but was extremely tired and was feeling the effects of the alcohol.
[4] The accused was seated in the middle.
The driver went into the store to pay for the gas and food.
The passenger by the door asked the accused to drive the vehicle around the corner and park it.
The accused did so.","The applicant sought to vary the 1995 consent judgment by terminating or significantly reducing spousal support of $2,500 per month.
The respondent suggested the reduction should be limited to the amount she now received from her old age pension and CPP.
Neither wanted a trial of the issue and submissions were primarily confined to the financial information filed.
HELD: On-going spousal support was reduced to $1,750 per month from April until March 1, 2001 and $1,250 thereafter.
 1)It is clear from Bracklow that each case involving spousal support must be determined on its own facts.
The court must give due consideration to all the factors and objectives of a spousal support order set out in s.15.2 of the Divorce Act rather than focusing on one factor alone, such as income levels or self sufficiency.
 2)There had been a material change in circumstances as the applicant, now 62, had lost his employment and suffered a debilitating leg injury while the respondent, now 67, was receiving an old age pension.
3)The 1995 agreement did not provide spousal support was either time limited or that it was to be varied if there was a substantial change in their future financial positions.
However, it was unlikely the parties intended spousal support to continue indefinitely at $2,500 per month even after the applicant retired.
The respondent was disadvantaged by the traditional marriage to a greater degree than the applicant as she devoted her full time to working in the home.
She received her full share of their joint efforts in the form of an equal division of the matrimonial property.
The economic benefits and disadvantages that flow from the marriage and its dissolution must be taken into account (Moge).
There was no merit in the wait-and-see suggestion of the respondent. 4)No costs.","[5, 3, 6, 8, 10, 12, 9, 13, 7, 11]"

Following amalgamation and before any collective agreement was concluded, the Chief of the amalgamated force issued a department order declaring that all persons in the position of the plaintiffs would be referred to as a level two Sergeant which created a two-tier structure within the Sergeant rank.
The bargaining agent for the union declined to process a grievance on behalf of the plaintiffs and agreed with the two-tiered structure which was eventually incorporated into the collective agreement.
After unsuccessfully complaining to the Nova Scotia Police Commission and the Halifax Regional Board of Police Commissioners, the plaintiffs commenced an action alleging that the creation of the two-tiered structure was a violation of the Police Act and adversely affected their employment rights.
The intervenor union brought an application to strike the plaintiffs' proceeding on the basis that the court lacked jurisdiction to hear the matter.
Application granted; proceeding stayed pending submission to arbitration or any other form of proceeding that is permitted under the statutory enactments applicable; if no application is made to lift the stay within two years, the action will stand dismissed.
Where there is a threshold question of whether the dispute is arbitrable, that decision should initially be made, absent very limited exceptions, by an arbitrator and not by the court.

[3] The Crown applied under section 42(9) of the YCJA for a determination that the aggravated assault be designated as a serious violent offence.
The Defence did not oppose the Crown’s request.
CIRCUMSTANCES OF OFFENCES [4] In the early morning hours of June 24, 2012, the victim Mr. Fischer was awakened by voices from the alley behind his house, where his van was parked.
In response, he went out to the alley with a baseball bat, which he keeps at the back door of his residence.

192,"March 31, 2011 [1] The accused was presented with an indictment containing five counts.
At the arraignment the Crown stayed counts 1 and 3.
[2] At the time of sentencing the accused had been in custody on the subject charges for two years and eleven months.
It was decided that a fit global sentence would be eight years and six months.
Credit of four years and nine months was given for the time spent in custody.
In the result, the following sentences were imposed:COUNT 2 Incarceration for two years and three months.
COUNT 4 Incarceration for one year and six months, consecutive to the preceding sentence.
COUNT 5 Incarceration for two years, concurrent with the preceding sentences.
Payment of the surcharge was waived as the accused had no income and would not have any for some time.
What follows are the reasons for the sentence imposed.
THE FACTS[3] In this case the conduct of the accused is most unusual, even bizarre, as it occurred while the accused was in prison.
It extended over 18 months; involved many separate acts; and required participation by several individuals with the accused as the co-ordinator.
[4] Commencing in February, 2006, the accused opened 52 false accounts with SaskTel.","An appeal of convictions on two offences under the Excise Tax Act.
Grounds for the appeal were summarized as lack of jurisdiction to proceed because of alleged defects in the summons; alternatively, the appellants were not properly advised of the charges they were facing contrary to s.11(a) of the Charter; Kimery should not have been convicted of an offence contrary to s.330 when the information set out an offence contrary to s.326 of the Excise Tax Act; there was no evidence to justify a finding that the Goods and Services Tax returns were not filed; unreasonable delay compromised their right to a fair trial; the demand for a return which was filed was invalid as there was no proof that it was signed by a person authorized to sign on the Minister's behalf.
HELD: The appeal was dismissed.
1)Any defects as to the form or service of the summons were unimportant.
The record clearly indicated the appellants appeared, pleaded and proceeded with the trial and made no objection.
Kimery never requested an adjournment nor was there any suggestion that he desired to be represented by counsel.
There was nothing to suggest he was confused or misled by the proceedings or that he did not understand the nature of the charges the appellants were facing.
The trial judge did everything required of him in the circumstances.
2)Section 330 does not set out a separate offence but merely clarifies the circumstances under which a director can be convicted of the same offence as a party.
This is no different than the situation of an accused being charged with a substantive offence under the Criminal Code on the theory that he is a party by virtue of s.21 of the Criminal Code.
Kimery was sole director of the corporation during the period in question when the returns were required to be filed.
It was open to the trial judge to find he must have directly participated in or at least acquiesced in the failure to file the appropriate GST returns.
3)There was evidence to support the finding that the appellants failed to file returns as required by s.326.
The appellants filed blank returns.
The trial judge found as a fact that there was no information relating to GST in any of the documents.
 It was agreed the returns were not merely defective but did not qualify as returns at all.
4)The appellants were not denied the right to a trial within a reasonable time as required by Charter s.11(b).
Pre-charge delay is not a factor which can be taken into account at this stage.
The appellant, having failed to rectify the omission after reasonable opportunities, could not now say they were somehow prejudiced.
Once charges were laid, the matter proceeded to trial within a reasonable time.
 5)The decision in R. v. Swyryda is a complete answer to the argument that the field position of 'Director Tax Services Office' was not authorized to exercise the powers and perform the duties of the Minister.
Also, s.24(2) of the Interpretation Act gives implied powers to persons acting under the authority of a minister of any Crown department over which that minister resides to undertake any act or do anything on behalf of the minister if that person is acting in a capacity appropriate to do the act or thing.
Section 24(2) appears to be a codification of the common law, frequently referred to as the Carltona principle based upon the 1943 English case, and followed in R. v. Harrison where the SCC held that responsible and experienced officials will have the ability to exercise the Minister's authority in accomplishing Ministerial duties.
The service of the demand in this case was not part of an explicit statutory or regulatory scheme of delegation.
It falls under an implicit scheme of delegation and sub-delegation as allowed at common law and in accordance with the Federal Interpretation Act.
 The execution and service of a demand to file a GST return is purely an administrative act.
 It does not require the exercise of Ministerial discretion nor does it deprive any citizen of any right by restricting a right to appeal.
The notice simply requires a taxpayer to comply with the statutory requirements of the Act.
The fact that the true copy of the notice annexed to the affidavit of service contains a facsimile signature is not significant.","[1, 2, 6, 8, 10, 13, 7, 11, 9, 14, 12, 17, 15]"

The appellant pleaded guilty to the following charge:That Kevin Eugene McGuigan of Regina between 1 October 1991 and 31 October 1993 at or near Regina did commit numerous assaults on Ashley Bjornson by slapping and striking her with miscellaneous objects, contrary to s. 266 of the Criminal Codeand was sentenced to one year imprisonment and one year's probation.
The evidence indicated that the assault consisted of cuffing the eight year stepdaughter rather frequently as a disciplinary measure.
There was also an incident where a small paddle was employed and she had been struck with a cookie box.
No injury had ever resulted from these assaults.
The more grievous conduct was the belittling and sarcastic verbal abuse the appellant directed frequently at the child over her eating habits and consequent weight.","An application for certiorari and mandamus.
In issue is whether the Youth Court judge has the discretion to refuse to appoint counsel to represent a young person having regard to the provisions of s.11(4) of the Young Offenders Act.
The meaning of the word 'unable' in s.11(4)(b) was in issue.
The youth was facing a variety of charges including failure to comply with conditions of an undertaking; failure to attend court; possession of property obtained by crime; obstructing a police officer.
He requested the Youth Court appoint counsel after his Legal Aid lawyer withdrew.
Both parents were on social assistance.
The matter was adjourned to investigate the possibility of an aunt providing financial assistance but the youth advised in April that she was unable to do so.
HELD: The application was dismissed.
The Youth Court judge did not err in refusing to direct counsel be appointed.
The Youth Court judge's discretion is not limited solely to considerations of financial inability.
The youth disentitled himself to continued Legal Aid representation by his own misconduct.","[3, 1, 4, 5, 2, 6, 0]"
194,"INTRODUCTION [1] The accused, Tyler James Hansen, is facing a number of charges outlined in a single information.
[2] The charges against the accused allege that, on or about June 20, 2010, at or near Prince Albert, Saskatchewan, he did:Count #1 – wound, maim, disfigure, or endanger the life of Chris Hujber, thereby committing an aggravated assault, contrary to section 268(1) of the Criminal Code.
Count #2 – unlawfully assault Cst.
Chris Hujber, a peace officer engaged in the lawful execution of his duty contrary to section 270(1) (a) of the Criminal Code.
Count #3 – commit an assault on Pamela Hujber, contrary to section 266 of the Criminal Code.
[3] Prior to trial the accused pled guilty to counts 5 and 6 in the information, being a curfew breach and an alcohol abstention breach on his undertaking.
At the argument stage of this trial, the Crown indicated they were not seeking a conviction on the count related to the alleged assault on Pam Hubjer, and that is appropriate, given the evidence I heard.

Immediately after the appointment of the receiver, the supplier presented a written demand for repossession of the books.
The receiver refused, claiming that the books were subject to an agreement for sale to the institution's students and therefore, exempt. 
A judge of the Supreme Court agreed and the supplier appealed.
Appeal allowed; return of books or payment of their value to the supplier ordered.
Although the goods were supplied as course materials, the institution's contract with its students obliged it to provide, in its discretion, textbooks and courseware needed for the program and the students acknowledged that it was necessary for the institution to change materials from time to time.
The books had not been distributed to the students as of the date of the supplier's demand.
The fact that the institution intended to supply certain materials did not give rise to a contractual obligation to provide these particular materials.
Thus, the books were not subject to any agreement for resale within the meaning of the Act.","[1, 3, 5, 4, 9, 10, 11, 12, 2, 16]"

In argument questions were raised as to the sufficiency of the evidence in respect of the copy which was given to the accused.
In a number of cases where the method adopted by the police officer of creating the copy has been the subject of questioning and has been found to be deficient, courts have refused to admit the certificate of analyses.
In the case at bar, the judge said:The Court in this instance in [sic] unable to infer that a true copy was indeed served, failing the proof by the police officer by way of his testimony that he did compare the two.
It's incumbent upon the police officer, be it carbon copy or indeed one of these new -- new types of Certificates with the copies, he still is required to compare, because there are typed versions.
The printing that is pre-printed may be the same, but the -- there may be some mistake in regards to the typed versions due to possible corrections the police officer may have made in typing the document and not correcting the copies.
He may have corrected the original and it was not transmitted on to the copies.","The accused applied for a stay of proceedings on the ground the Crown failed to provide adequate disclosure.
In making disclosure, the Crown appended a copy of the respondent's criminal record to its affidavit.
The defence then applied for a stay on the ground of perception of bias on the part of the Provincial Court judge because the respondent's criminal record was before her.
The Crown appealed the order which prohibited the judge from continuing as trial judge in respect to the respondent's criminal charges of impaired driving, driving with blood alcohol levels exceeding .08, and dangerous driving.
HELD: The appeal was allowed.
The order for prohibition was quashed and the matter was remitted to the Provincial Court for trial.
There is abundant authority that disclosure of an accused's criminal record to the court alone does not amount to an automatic disqualification of the court on the ground of apprehended bias, appearance of bias or other prejudice to the accused.
The judgment in R. v. Peters is almost directly on point.
The judge in this case said she had not read the record, she was not biased as a result of the information tendered at the pre-trial proceedings and the record was something she could put out of her mind as she did in all instances where she ruled evidence inadmissible.
She was correct in these circumstances to dismiss the application for a stay and to decline to recluse herself.","[0, 1, 5, 6, 2, 8, 10, 7, 9]"

Kolenick, PCJ JUDGMENT June 22, 2007 [1] The accused is charged that he did, on or about February 17, 2006, at Saskatoon, drive while disqualified, contrary to s. 89(1) of The Highway Traffic Act, as it was then.
The alleged driving occurred when the accused was involved in a motor vehicle accident and engaged in other alleged misconduct, including driving without due care and consideration for others, and failing to identify himself to the other driver before departing from the scene.
BACKGROUND[2] Mr. Buyaki is 25 years of age.
It is apparent from the Driver History, which has been filed by the Crown, that his S.G.I.
driving record since the year 2000 includes numerous entries for motor vehicle accidents, summary offence tickets, and other administrative actions by S.G.I., which have, on occasion, resulted in the disqualification of his driving privileges for varying lengths of time.
[3] Further in that regard, the Crown filed a letter dated July 11, 2005 from S.G.I.
to the accused.
[4] Also included in the evidence for the Crown herein is a Certificate of Disqualification or Prohibition, signed on behalf of the Administrator under The Vehicle Administration Act (since repealed).","A complaint was made in 1991 to the Human Rights Commission that the Gallery could only be entered by stairs and was inaccessible to wheelchair users.
A Board of Inquiry appointed under the Saskatchewan Human Rights Code concluded in 1993 that the appellant's complex impeded physical access to the premises, facilities and services and lacked proper amenities for persons who are wheelchair-reliant.
The Board specifically ordered it remained seized of the matter and the hearing would be reconvened to hear further evidence.
The Court of Queen's Bench confirmed the Gallery continued to discriminate against disabled members of the public by failing to provide access and accessible services and ordered the appellant to construct or renovate washrooms to meet requirements of the National Building Code of Canada.
The Court of Appeal set aside the Queen's Bench decision and restored the Board's decision.
During those proceedings, the property was transferred to HKR, which undertook further renovations.
In 1997 upon request by the Commission, the Board reconvened and concluded there had not been compliance, which was confirmed by the Court of Queen's Bench.
This was not appealed.
An appeal of the Board's 1998 order to construct or renovate the bathrooms was dismissed and it was found the Board did not err in adding HKR as a party nor exceeded its jurisdiction in finding the appellant had not complied with the original order.
The appellant appealed that judgment principally on the ground of error in not finding the Board exceeded its jurisdiction in making the order as the original order did not include a requirement that it construct wheelchair accessible washrooms.
HELD: The appeal was dismissed with costs on double Column V.
The Queen's Bench judge did not err in finding the appellant could not, at that stage of proceedings, question the original order made by the Board in 1993 (ordering the appellant to cease impeding physical access to the premises, facilities and services).
The issue had been previously determined and the order was reinstated by the Court of Appeal.
The Board acted entirely within the terms of its original order.
It retained jurisdiction to confirm compliance.
The original order cannot be challenged at this late date.","[0, 5, 3, 7, 8, 4, 1, 6, 11, 2]"

 The wife argued the agreement was not applicable to the present situation where they have separated and was only in effect during the time of the marriage or upon their deaths.

1)There was no conflict in the evidence as to the verbal agreement made at the time of the marriage nor as to their intention.
This is an appropriate situation to apply s.40 of the Family Property Act.
The fact they each executed a will to give effect to that intention and the husband paid practically all of the day-to-day expenses led to the conclusion their verbal agreement should be considered binding, notwithstanding their marriage ended by separation rather than death.
2)The condominium purchased by the husband was the 'family home' as provided for in s.2(1)(a).
There was no extraordinary circumstance as provided in s.22(1), which would prevent equal division of the value of the family home.

FOR THE DEFENCE.
- - - Introduction 1.
The accused is charged with committing a number of break and enters of homes in Prince Albert, Saskatchewan.
He pleaded guilty to many of these but denied involvement in three of them.
The trial on those three charges began on April 29, 2003.
After hearing evidence from the home owners, a co-accused, and peace officers who investigated the incidents, the Crown advised the court of its intention to call one Ace Carlos Whitecap to the witness box.
He had been subpoenaed by the Crown and, unknown to the prosecution, had been sitting in court listening to the other Crown witnesses.
Defence counsel objected on this basis but he also argued that the Crown had ambushed him and his client.
He said that the Crown had not disclosed their intention to call this witness and that they should not be permitted to do so.
In addition, Ace Carlos Whitecap is also a client of Mr. Bendig’s and he would not be able to cross-examine Whitecap effectively or at all.

Issues (1) Has there been a failure to disclose on the part of the Crown?","The mother moved for the dismissal of the pending permanent care trial, arguing that, applying the reasoning in a recent Court of Appeal decision, the court had lost jurisdiction.
No trial had been held on any issue as all matters had proceeded to this point with the consent of the parties.
The time for trial had been extended to allow the mother to retain counsel.
Application dismissed; the court had not lost jurisdiction; trial to proceed.
The Court of Appeal decision stands for the proposition that, once a trial at any stage of the Act is held, no order can have effect beyond the next statutory deadline; however, this is so only when the extensions are included in an order which follows trial.
When the best interests of the child require it, an extension of a statutory deadline can be made in order to have a trial completed in respect of any stage of the Act.
When the plan of care changes from reunification to permanent care close to the particular deadline, it is not in a child's best interest for the court to order a rushed trial date.","[1, 3, 2, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 10, 9, 11, 14, 16, 12]"

KOVATCH, J Background[1] The accused, Karyn Mae Fayant is charged with mischief under $5,000.00 by smashing a window, and with an aggravated assault upon Joe Cwynar.
The major issue for determination is whether the accused can be convicted of the charge of aggravated assault, or whether she should be convicted of one of the lesser and included offences.
Evidence[2] The complainant, Joe Cwynar, testified that he and the accused have been in an on and off relationship since March 2004.
In April, 2010, he and the complainant met up and were house sitting at Fort Qu’appelle, Saskatchewan.
[3] On the way to Mossbank, the accused purchased some alcohol.
They arrived at the complainant’s home in the neighbourhood of 6:30 to 7:00 p.m.
According to Mr. Cwynar, the accused then began drinking.
According to him, the accused became quite drunk and suggested that the two of them go for a walk.
They did go outside, and then got into an argument because the complainant believed he had lost his keys.

[4] Defence argues that section 35 is unconstitutional in that it creates a reverse onus, infringing the right of the accused to be presumed innocent until proven guilty, and is not saved by section 1 of the Charter.
The Crown argues that section 35 is constitutionally valid, citing numerous decisions upholding the constitutionality of reverse onus provisions in a regulatory context.
[5] There is a side issue, fully argued by both sides, which is mostly irrelevant to the Charter argument.
Mr. Paulsen did possess a fishing licence, valid on its face.

HELD: By fiat of December 5, 2003, the Court dismissed the application for injunctive relief with reasons to follow.
These are those reasons. 1)
The wrongs the plaintiff says it will suffer at the hands of the defendant employees result from the decision of the defendant to expand its business from one dealing with educational supplies, office products and furniture to one involving the supply and service of business machines.
The new direction brings the defendants into direct competition with the plaintiff's business.
2) The defendants hired Garry Huntington once his non-competition agreement with the plaintiff expired.
The defendants also placed ads in newspapers and hired some 30 employees of the plaintiff.
The plaintiff was concerned that the departing employees would take with them confidential information and that it would have difficulty hiring replacements, which would affect its ability to service its clients.
3) The departing employees gave 2 weeks notice.
The plaintiff failed to demonstrate that it was entitled to more than 2 weeks notice.
4) The affidavit materials filed by the plaintiff provided no evidence of competition or solicitation or imminent danger or threat of such by the defendants.

Issues [5] At issue is whether the arresting officer formed the requisite belief necessary to make a roadside demand pursuant to s. 254(2).

He submitted the unfunded pension liabilities constitute trust funds pursuant to provincial pension legislation (the Pension Benefits Act s.43(3)) and as such the pension fund claimants are entitled to preferred or secured creditor status.
HELD: The Proposal was accepted.
 1)Provincially created statutory trusts such as the one created by the Pensions Benefits Act are not recognized in bankruptcy including Proposals submitted under the BIA.
The Trustee and the company acted appropriately in identifying the nature and status of the pensioners' claims.
Although it might have reflected the status of his claim against the employer outside the BIA, the specific objection did not constitute a valid ground of legal objection to the Proposal.
2)The Proposal met the statutory and judicial criteria for acceptance by the Court.
The Court takes into account the interests of the debtor, general body of creditors and the public at large in maintaining the integrity of the bankruptcy legislation.
Of the 15 employees in the same position, 12 voted in favour of the proposal, 2 failed to file proofs of their claims; 89 percent of all creditors voted in favour of acceptance.
 3)Each party was to assume their own costs of the hearing.","[2, 5, 6, 4, 0, 7, 9, 8, 10, 3]"

26 J.C. W. IN THE QUEEN'S BENCHJUDICIAL CENTRE OF WYNYARD BETWEEN:CURTIS BRENT SHRADERAPPELLANT- and - HER MAJESTY THE QUEENRESPONDENT A. Kapoor for the accusedDarryl Bode for the CrownJUDGMENT HALVORSON J. August 28, 1995 The accused seeks to overturn his conviction for failing to attend court by arguing that the trial judge ought to have accepted his excuse for not appearing.
At issue is whether the accused advanced a ""lawful excuse"".
This is what happened.
The accused was charged with an impaired driving offence.
He attended court and indicated he would be retaining a lawyer.
The judge set a return date and informed the accused he must appear personally because the Crown was proceeding by indictment.
On the return date the accused did not show up, so the present charge was laid.
At his trial the accused offered an explanation for his absence.
Apparently, he was working on an oil rig which was an 11 hour drive from Foam Lake where his case was to be heard.
His plan was to complete his shift the day before the trial and then drive to court.
He therefore tried to reach his lawyer by telephone.","Fulltext of judgment follows:
[1] The appellant wife appeals the decision of the chambers judge varying the amount of child support and reducing the amount of arrears.
She contends that the chambers judge erred in varying the order for maintenance and reducing the amount of arrears in the absence of evidence that there was a change in the conditions, means and needs of the respondent or the children as contemplated by s. 17(4) of the Divorce Act.[FOOTNOTE 1][2]
The respondent contends that the amount of child support should be reduced by reason of his reduced income caused by his unemployment or reduced employment over the last four years.
The appellant argues that the respondent has failed to satisfactorily explain his unemployment.
There is evidence that his change in income is due to his own voluntary action and, as a result, he has failed to establish the threshold 'change in circumstances' which could result in a variation of the order.
[3] The appeal is allowed and the decision of the chambers judge is set aside.
There is evidence from which this Court can impute income to the respondent in the amount of $27,000, and the child support shall be varied to $510.00 per month as of February 1, 2004 in accordance with the Child Support Guidelines.
The sum of $1,926.78 currently held by the Maintenance Enforcement Office shall be applied to the arrears.
The respondent shall pay the sum of $200.00 per month on the arrears commencing April 1, 2004.
[4] The appellant shall have her costs in the usual way.1R.S.C. 1985, c. 3 (2nd. Supp.).","[0, 1, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 2, 9, 10, 11, 14]"

St. Onge for the respondentJUDGMENT POPESCUL J. August 30, 2010 Introduction [1] Very few charges laid by the Crown are declared to be void ab initio.
This is because the modern approach to determining the sufficiency of informations and indictments dictates that only counts that are drafted so poorly that they bear no resemblance to an existing offence will be found to be “void” or labelled an “offence not known to law”.
In this case, the charge, as drafted, is so palpably bad it does not give fair notice to the defendant of the nature of the charge nor the penalties that may be imposed if a breach is established.
As a result, the appeal must be allowed and the charge declared void because it does not charge an offence known to law.
66(3) The Vehicle Equipment Regulations (Reg 10)”.
[4] The grounds of appeal stated in the notice of appeal are as follows: Conviction 1.)
The Crown did [sic] prove their case of sunscreen being present.
The Offence Notice issued on January 25, 2008 failed to describe the location of the alleged offence.","FIAT: In 1996, the respondent was ordered to pay $600 per month as child support for his daughter.
He now applies to reduce his support obligation and rescind the arrears which have accumulated.
HELD: 1) In 1999, the respondent sold his ownership interest in a business and retained a one-third interest.
In 2001, he was terminated from his full-time employment as a result of an unexplained absence from work after he received a suspension for insubordination.
Since his termination, he has not obtained full-time employment.
He has continued to work seasonally 3 months a year and earn the gross amount of $21,000.
The Court found that it is the respondent's choice to work a minimum amount each year.
It has been said that individuals, who are subject to support obligations, are entitled to make decisions in relation to their careers as long as the decisions are reasonable at the time having regard to the circumstances.
The respondent's decision to work only three months a year and to possibly return to school is not reasonable.
2) For the purposes of this application, the respondent's income was imputed to be $40,000 and he was ordered to pay $328 per month as support for his daughter.
3) The sharing of the s. 7 special expenses should be based on the respondent's imputed income.
4) A retroactive variation of child support is warranted.
The respondent commenced his application for variation in June 2002 and the chambers judge was of the view that any variation of support should be retroactive to September 2002.
 In light of the fact the respondent's previous support obligation was tax deductible/tax inclusive, the petitioner may in fact benefit from a retroactive variation as the child support she will receive, pursuant to this order, will be payable on a net of tax basis.
 5) Rule 608(2) provides that a successful party will be entitled to costs of a family law proceeding unless, pursuant to Rule 608(3), the successful party has behaved unreasonably or has acted in bad faith.
The difficulty in the matter before me is determining whether or not the respondent has been successful.
Although his support obligation decreases, his previous payment was tax deductible while his ongoing payment will be net of tax.
It is very likely that the respondent's financial position has not changed as a result of the order.
The Court also had grave concerns respecting the substantial delays in the proceedings caused by the respondent's unwillingness to provide financial disclosure.
Costs were awarded to the petitioner in the sum of $750, as the discovery motion would not have been necessary had the respondent provided appropriate financial disclosure.","[3, 5, 0, 6, 1, 10, 8, 4, 13, 11]"

No witnesses testified for the defence.
[3] At the onset of the trial, counsel for the Crown and the accused advised the Court that Constable Strueby obtained a Warrant to Search for Blood samples from a Justice of the Peace on January 10, 2009.
The warrant resulted in blood samples being taken from the accused.
[4] I granted leave to cross-examine on the Information to Obtain a Search Warrant.
Guided by the Supreme Court of Canada’s decisions in R. v. Garafoli, [1990] 2 S.C.R.
1461 and R. v. Lising, 2005 SCC 66 (CanLII), [2005] 3 S.C.R.
[6] The first issue before the Court arises from the voir dire and concerns whether the Information to Obtain blood samples contained sufficient grounds in support of the warrant.
I then conducted an analysis pursuant to s. 24(2) of the Charter respecting the violation of the accused’s s. 8 rights.
I determined that the Certificate of Analyst and the report from the analyst dated April 20, 2010, should be admitted into evidence at trial.
[7] I then considered all of the evidence before me at trial.","FIAT: The issues to be determined on this application are custody, child support and cancellation of the arrears of child support.
HELD: 1)
On the issue of custody, the mere passage of time, in this instance 9 years, would constitute a material change in circumstances relevant to custody.
The child is now 15 years old.
The parties are not candidates for joint custody and shared parenting.
The child's view of the dysfunctional relationship between her parents compels this Court to preserve the status quo as being in the child's best interests.
The petitioner will continue as the sole custodian.
 2) The access was varied in January 2004.
Nothing has changed to warrant a variation.
3) There was no evidence to support the respondent's statement that the child is living with him half the time.
There was no evidence or explanation as to why he has failed to pay child support, which creates the present arrears.
The evidence with respect to the respondent's finances was unsworn and out of date.
In oral argument, the respondent asserted that he contributed to his daughter's care and that he is contributing to her education trust fund.
If these expenditures were in fact made over and above his own cost of living, the Court would be compelled to accept the fact that he has financial resources available to him other that the $9,940 of social assistance which is disclosed in his tax return and financial statement. 4)
The essence of the respondent's application for variation of the child support is based on his claim that his health has precluded him from working.
The respondent's doctor was examined and, based on that medical evidence, the Court could not conclude that the respondent's generalized anxiety and depression disorder is beyond his control.
The evidence was that the respondent could choose to help himself by eliminating alcohol and marijuana use.
The respondent failed to meet the burden of proof by demonstrating that his depression and anxiety disorder was the consequence of factors beyond his control and thus preventing him from working and having an income with which to pay his child support obligations during the period under review.
The application for variation of child support and cancellation of child support arrears is dismissed with costs.","[5, 7, 1, 2, 9, 15, 11, 19, 6, 17, 10, 18]"

GREEN, J [1] Mr. Charron is charged with operating or with being in the care or control of a vehicle while impaired by alcohol on August 25, 2009, at Rocanville.
Count number two on the information - operating or being in care or control of a vehicle over .08 - was dismissed by me upon the defence application for a nonsuit.
[2] During the testimony of Cst.
Pshyk, the final Crown witness, an issue arose about whether the defence had been provided with full disclosure by the Crown.
In making this application, the defence asserts a breach of Mr. Charron’s right to make full answer and defence under s. 7 of the Charter as a result of a lack of full disclosure.
[3] Upon Mr. Charron being charged Mr. Moore requested and received disclosure from Cst.
Granrude of the Moosomin RCMP, who at that time was acting as the agent of the Crown.
That disclosure included two Intoxilyzer 5000C Operational Checkseets (Exhibit D-1 and D-2).","The 23 year old defendant pled guilty to two counts of breaking and entering a dwelling house and one count of breaking and entering a shed.

An award of $700.00 a month spousal support was not unreasonable having regard for (i) the length of the relationship (approximately fifteen years), (ii) the husband's wage (approximately $55,000.00 per year) and (iii) the fact that the wife had seldom worked outside the home.","[6, 2, 8, 5, 7, 4, 15, 19, 23, 10, 18, 22, 3, 14, 13]"
211,"The defence has admitted all of the essential elements of each charge; the only issue is the factual one of whether or not Ms. Neigel was the person operating the vehicle.
The defence suggests that another individual, Mr. Wiens, was the driver, and that he had vacated the vehicle moments before the officers arrived.
THE FACTS:[2] The background is not in dispute.
The officers had been advised that, on occasion, there were compliance issues respecting “cut off” at the local bar, so they decided to drop in while on routine patrol.
The officers arrived at the hotel at 2:00 a.m., at which time they observed Ms. Neigel, and other individuals, playing “drinking games”; Cst.
Holmstrom estimated that there were five or six people.
Ms. Neigel jokingly asked the officers to join them.
The officers gave a friendly warning to the individuals not to drive when they left the bar, and exited the establishment.
By all accounts, this encounter was quite friendly in nature.
[3] The officers continued their patrol in the area, and returned to the bar at approximately 3:00 a.m., the closing time.
The officers stopped in the back lane, and both noted people exit the back of the bar, and get into a black truck.
Holmstrom thought that four or five people got into the truck.","The Respondents contracted with the Department to care for a child and his Mother who was mentally disabled.
After two years, the relationship between the Respondents and the Mother broke down and she left their home.

1)The Respondents had sufficient interest under s.6 of The Children's Law Act to seek custody of the child.
2)The trial judge correctly determined that the only issue was the child's best interests, even in a contest between a parent and a stranger, although the parent/child relationship was one factor to be considered.
3)The findings of the trial judge were strongly supported by the evidence, the law was correctly applied, and therefore his decision ought not be overturned.

212,"GRAY, J BACKGROUND[1] On July 14, 2010, Mr. Palmer was charged with operating a motor vehicle while his ability to do so was impaired by alcohol or a drug contrary to ss.
255(1) and 253(1)(a) of the Criminal Code, and also with operating a motor vehicle after consuming alcohol in such a quantity that the concentration thereof in his blood exceeded 80 milligrams of alcohol in 100 millilitres of blood contrary to ss.
255(1) and 253(1)(b) of the Criminal Code.
[2] The proceedings commenced with two Crown witnesses called on the trial proper.
As counsel for the accused provided notice of his intention to raise certain Charter issues, the evidence of a third Crown witness Constable Walz was called on a voir dire.
His testimony is the only evidence left for the Court to consider in determining the Charter application.
The accused asserts that he was arbitrarily detained as the officer did not have reasonable grounds to make a demand for a sample of his breath for analysis.
[3] Thus, the only issues to resolve are:(i) Did the investigating officer have reasonable grounds to make the Intoxilyzer demand pursuant to s. 254(3) of the Criminal Code?
(ii) If a Charter breach is made out, is the appropriate remedy the exclusion of the Certificate of Analyses?","This was a petition for divorce with an application for settlement of corollary matters, especially custody and access.
The mother was the primary caregiver during the marriage, but the father also made significant contributions.
The parties had an interim order for joint custody, which the father sought to continue.
The mother sought sole custody with generous access.
The evidence was that although both parents were good parents, they had difficulty in resolving problems between them, causing a lack of communication.
Allowing the mother's application,
that because the day to day decision-making was problematic, it was necessary for one of the parties to be given final say.
Both parents were to continue to share in rights and responsibilities on major issues.
As the parties lacked flexibility, a detailed access plan was incorporated.","[3, 1, 4, 7, 5, 6, 8, 9, 2]"
213,"CIRCUMSTANCES[2] Around midnight on September 5, 2010, the accused was stopped by an RCMP officer shortly after driving away from a bar/restaurant in Oxbow.
The accused blew a fail on the approved screening device and was taken to Carlyle, where samples of breath were obtained with readings of 130 mgs and 120 mgs at 1:21 a.m. and 1:41 a.m. respectively.
ISSUES1) Were the accused’s rights to counsel infringed and, if so what is the remedy?
2) Did the destruction of video evidence held by the RCMP breach the accused’s right to make full answer and defence?
In fact, the accused’s cell phone was taken from him on arrival at the Carlyle Detachment.
[4] The second issue raised by the defence related to the availability of phone books and lists of lawyers for the accused.
Phone books were available in the main office of the detachment but not in the lawyer room where the accused was placed to speak to counsel.
[6] Fourthly, the defence argued that the accused had, by implication, expressed dissatisfaction with his call to Legal Aid.
Accordingly, the officer(s) should have provided a “Prosper” warning to the accused before proceeding to take samples of breath.","At trial in Provincial Court, the accuseds called no evidence and were convicted.
They appealed on the basis that the Crown's evidence was so insufficient that a verdict of guilty was unreasonable or was one which could not reasonably be supported on the evidence.
HELD: Appeal dismissed.
1)No medical evidence was necessary to establish that the victim's injuries were caused by an assault, given the photographs admitted into evidence, the evidence of the police officer who was called to the scene of the assault and the evidence of the 7-11 clerk who was first approached by the victim for assistance.
2)Evidence of exclusive opportunity was unnecessary to sustain a conviction where there was other circumstantial evidence pointing to the identity of the accuseds.
3)Although a failure to permit an accused who calls no evidence to argue last in a jury trial might be a good ground of appeal, the failure to be permitted to argue last before a judge alone was merely a procedural error which could be cured under the curative provision contained in S.686(1)(b)(iv) of the Criminal Code.","[1, 3, 4, 7, 6, 8, 2, 10, 11]"

In rendering his decision, the trial judge stated at page 104:All of the evidence is that he was the complete focus of Constable Coe’s attention and I can’t see that there is any unexplained delay.
It’s very much the norm here, time wise, and it seems to me that, that that particular defence on the, on the .08 charge is not there.
I certainly think the impaired driving charge is stronger and although I believe I would as well convict him on the .08, but certainly I find him guilty of the impaired and am entering a judicial stay on the, on the .08 accordingly.

HELD: Appeal allowed.
1)Because the accused had no related record and given the circumstances of the assault,
the sentence of imprisonment was reduced to time already served (15 days).
2)The trial judge erred in imposing the 10 year fire arm prohibition under S.100 of the Code. S.100 requires a conviction on an indictable offence involving violence against a person where the maximum sentence available is 10 years imprisonment or more.

The hospital staff participating in the investigation and review were advised that their information would be treated as part of a 'peer review' and therefore confidential.
Upon receipt of the report the hospital, as a result, refused to disclose the report to the families.
An application pursuant to the Freedom of Information and Protection of Privacy Act was made by an M.L.A., who sought for the disclosure of the report and for a review of the hospital's decision to not release the report.
The hospital decided to release the full report.
The appellant employees appealed the decision of the hospital, claiming that they had been assured confidentiality.
Allowing the appeal,
that the disclosure of personal information consisting of personal recommendations or evaluations, character references, or personal evaluations by the appellants and other hospital staff are presumed under s. 20(3)(g) of the Act to be an unreasonable invasion of a third party's personal privacy.
Under s. 20(1) the hospital is required to refuse to disclose this information.
It necessarily follows that recommendations in the report founded upon such information is also presumed to be an unreasonable invasion of privacy and is likewise not to be disclosed.

4.
5.
[2] At the outset of the trial counsel for the accused took the position that the accused’s rights pursuant to ss.
8, 9 and 10 of Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms were infringed and that all evidence obtained after the initial stop should be excluded pursuant to s. 24(2) of the Charter.
These sections read as follows:8.
Everyone has the right to be secure against unreasonable search or seizure.
9.
Everyone has the right not to be arbitrarily detained or imprisoned.
10.
Everyone has the right on arrest or detention (a) to be informed promptly of the reasons therefor; (b) to retain and instruct counsel without delay and to be informed of that right; and .

836.","The applicant sought to have the law firm barred from acting for the plaintiff because a member of that firm had been active in representing the defendant prior to 1991 when the defendant changed lawyers following a change in government.
This action was commenced after the change of solicitors and there was no suggestion that the subject matter of the action was ever the subject of any consultation between the defendant and its former solicitors.
The applicant raised arguments about the confidential nature of its adjusting and investigation of loss claims and internal policy procedures and litigation strategies in relation to the denial of claims.
HELD: The application was dismissed with costs to the respondent in any event of the cause.
1)In 1993 in a similar application respecting another member of the same law firm the judge ruled against the plaintiff.
This was consistent with a similar attempt following the 1982 change of government.
 2)The only identifiable strategy (or perhaps a tactic) adopted to date has been excessive delay requiring applications to force compliance with the Rules and two applications to deprive the plaintiff of its chosen legal representation. 3)Once it is determined that there is no actual knowledge of the case in question the onus to establish the existence of confidential information shifts to the party asserting the concern.
4)As the applicant is a public corporation it is doubtful it has or should have secret strategies with which to defeat persons claiming under its insurance scheme.
It is entitled to have its own preordained policies in respect of disputed claims but if such policies exist they probably should be made known to the public for whose benefit the corporation exists.
Also such policies may well have changed since 1992.","[0, 1, 2, 7, 9, 5, 4, 11, 15, 13, 17, 3, 18, 19, 20, 21, 16, 23, 25, 24, 28, 36, 38, 22, 37]"

Husky Oil appealed the decision by the Board of Revenue Commissioners which held Husky liable to pay tax on documentation charges.
The primary function of the documentation was ongoing technical support for the valves operation, maintenance and modifications.
The valves and documentation were identified as separate items on the same purchase order and arrived at the job site separately.
The Board decided that the appellant purchased the documentation independent of the valves and were subject to tax under ss.5(9) unless exempted under ss.8(1)(f).
The parties agreed the documents fell within the definition of tangible property as set out in the Act.
At issue was the interpretation by the Board of the word 'published' as used in ss.5(1)(b) of eg. 1 when defining the word 'books' and whether the drawings were exempt from tax.
HELD: The appeal was allowed and the decision of the Board reversed.
Costs were awarded to the appellant. 1)The role of the Court was in the nature of judicial review and supervisory in nature.
The Court's role on questions of fact is restricted to circumstances where the evidence does not support findings of fact.
2)There was evidence which could support either interpretation of the facts.
 3)The determination of whether the documents were required for preparing the property for use in Saskatchewan is a question of fact.
There was nothing technical about the statutory requirement.
The words used are simple and ordinary.
It was open to the Board to determine as a finding of fact that the documentation was not required for preparing the valves for use. 4)Technical papers by their nature are often going to a narrow audience.
To focus upon the extent to which technical papers are directed at a public audience so as to determine their taxability makes no sense and is at odds with the proposition that technical papers can be exempt from tax.
The broad interpretation eliminates this anomaly.
 5)Having determined that the word published is intended to speak to purpose and not to extent of the audience it was not necessary to comment upon the definition adopted by the Board.","[1, 3, 5, 6, 2, 4, 9, 10, 8, 12]"

The accused is charged with offences contrary to Sections 271(1) and 153 of the Criminal Code.
The sexual assault and touching allegations allegedly occurred between January 15, 1998 and March 31, 1999.
2.
The evidence of the complainant was that the accused touched her numerous times on her vagina and breasts.
In all cases the touching was over top of her clothing.
On one occasion she said that he “grabbed my butt”.
3.
The complainant, her mother, her siblings and the accused all lived in a house here in Prince Albert, Saskatchewan.
The complainant’s bedroom was in the basement of the house adjacent to the room where the family watched TV.
There was a couch or love-seat in that room.
The accused often slept on this couch.
Sometimes he slept down there because he was angry with the complainant’s mother for not wanting to have sex with him.","The accused was acquitted on a charge of operating a motor vehicle while impaired by alcohol or drugs and while his blood alcohol level exceeded 80 milligrams of alcohol in 100 millilitres of blood when questions were raised as to the sufficiency of the evidence with respect to the copy of the certificate of analysis.
HELD: 1)Section 258(7) has been judicially amended to mean 'true copy' which presumably, though not logically, means something more than 'copy'.
It has grown to the point that an affidavit may be disregarded if the police do not provide supplemental evidence when challenged as to the manner in which they assured the accuracy of the copy.
2)The trial judge further advanced the law to a point where, even when not challenged, there is an obligation to provide supplemental evidence of comparison in order to buttress the evidence of the affidavit.
This is an error of law.
A challenge under s258(7) should be based upon a discovered difference as between the copy and the original.
Otherwise the refusal to admit the certificate becomes merely a prize in a procedural game which can only bring the justice system into disrepute.
3)A new trial was ordered to determine whether the stop was justified.","[2, 5, 3, 6, 11, 8, 9, 1, 10, 12, 13, 0, 7, 17, 4, 16, 14, 15, 18]"

Cardinal for the CrownR.T. McCann for the accused JUDGMENT (ORAL) BAYNTON J.September 27, 1995 The accused is charged with sexually assaulting the complainant between the dates of October 22, 1986 and March 31, 1988 at Beardy's Indian Reserve.
The accused was born on October 22, 1968 so that he ceased to be a ""young person"" within the meaning of the Young Offenders Act, R.S.C.
1985, c. Y-1, on the first date specified in the indictment.
The IssueThe sole issue before me is whether it has been proven beyond a reasonable doubt that the sexual assaults alleged occurred on or after October 22, 1986, the date that the accused became an adult.
The determination of the specific dates of multiple sexual assaults of children over a period of time is not usually of critical importance, but it is in this rather unique case.","The offender, a former police chief, plead guilty to five theft related charges.
The amount of money involved for all five counts was $64,000.
He used his position of authority as police chief to commit the crimes.
The offender did not have a criminal record.
The offences were premeditated, and directed against trusting and well-intentioned organizations.
Sentencing the offender to four months consecutive imprisonment on each count, for a total of twenty months, and ordering restitution to the victims,
 that the sentence must serve as a message of deterrence to all individuals who hold positions of trust and authority.
This message is particularly important to police officers, whose integrity must be beyond reproach.","[1, 0, 2, 3, 4, 6, 7, 8, 9, 5]"

Stephens for the accused JUDGMENT BAYNTON J. December 11, 2000The Nature of the Case[1] The accused is charged with sexual assault pursuant to s. 271 of the Criminal Code.
This is the second case that I have heard this year that involves gross intoxication on the part of not only the accused but the complainant as well.
Such cases are becoming more numerous and pose problems for the court that are not encountered in most sexual assault cases that are heard.
I will outline these problems and review the special provisions in the Criminal Code that apply to such cases.
[2] Judges and juries determine the facts of any given case from the raw material (i.e.
the evidence) that is presented by the witnesses who are called to testify.
The accuracy of this fact finding determination depends on the quality of this testimonial evidence.
The finder of fact assesses the quality of the evidence by means of a two-fold process.
Obviously if the witness is lying, his or her evidence is false and is of no value.","The appellant sought an order quashing a decision of an adjudicator following a hearing pursuant to s. 62 of the Labour Standards Act.
The Director of Labour Standards ordered the employer to pay $1,500 in lieu of a proper notice of termination.
The grounds raised were that the adjudicator erred in law in finding the respondent had not frustrated or fundamently breached her employment contract; the adjudicator exceeded his jurisdiction by holding the employer had an obligation to attempt to resolve the workplace difficulties that prohibited the respondent from reporting to work.
The employee had been charged with stealing three pencils on her way through a store to the salon where she worked.
The Crown subsequently withdrew the shoplifting charges.
She was prohibited from returning that the store and as there was no alternate entrance to the salon the employer treated the contract as frustrated or breached, therefore releasing him of any obligation to pay wages in lieu of notice.
HELD: The appeal was dismissed with costs.
1)The adjudicator concluded the employer failed to meet the thresholds stipulated in O'Connell which set out the six essential elements for determining whether events had frustrated an employment contract: a critical rather than a trivial supervening event; an event protracted in time; not within the contemplation of the parties; coming about without fault on either party; an event that rendered the parties incapable of performing their contractual obligations; the performance of a contract would radically alter the original agreement into something other than that intended.
The employer did not establish he was incapable of performing his obligations by permitting the employee access to the workplace.
 2)The phrases 'patently unreasonable' and 'degree of deference' in a s63(1) appeal may have meanings materially different from those in a judicial review. 3)The hearing process before the adjudicator is not a highly specialized one.
The correctness test was applicable to general questions of law.
The adjudicator applied the appropriate principles of law to the facts as he found them.
4)The adjudicator acted within his jurisdiction when determining the terms of the employment contract and that the employer had not fulfilled his obligations.","[0, 1, 7, 2, 9, 5, 4, 3, 8, 15, 12, 11, 10, 13]"

They include robbery, aggravated assault, assault causing bodily harm, possession of stolen property, and trafficking in narcotics.

The drugs were apprehended by the Moose Jaw Police Service acting on information received from the Saskatoon Police Service on August 3, 2000.

As the police vehicle approached the intersection of Broad Street and Saskatchewan Drive, Constable Bacon observed a driver on a moped proceed northbound on Broad Street against a red light.
Constable Bacon testified that the moped had an electric motor under the seat.

The plaintiff managed post-secondary programs with an annual budget of $960,000, taught upgrading and university entrance courses, and supervised other teaching and support staff.
In 1996 an education board was established and given the task of overseeing the administration of the education complex and its teaching programs.
There was overlap between the plaintiff and the board's mandate and functions that led to conflict.
The board suspended the plaintiff for 10 days during which time it intended to investigate the plaintiff's conduct.
The suspension continued and the board later passed a resolution formally terminating the plaintiff's employment.
The plaintiff sued for wrongful dismissal.
The defendant contended it dismissed the plaintiff with cause.
HELD: The plaintiff was wrongfully dismissed.
The court ruled that the employer had to provide evidence demonstrating serious employee misconduct.
There was no such evidence produced by the defendant, and it was not enough simply to show a loss of confidence in the plaintiff or dissatisfaction with his job performance.
The plaintiff's damages were limited to being paid out the end of his term contract.
Punitive and aggravated damages were not allowed.

The development officer's decision was based on interpretation of relevant legislation and the proper standard of review is correctness.
The development officer misinterpreted the legislation.
Since the applicant had already received tentative approval under the old regime, it did not have to meet the new higher standards for final approval.
There was not another legal remedy open to the applicant equally convenient, beneficial and appropriate.
The right of appeal under the legislation existed only from a refusal by a development officer and technically, this was not a refusal as the application was found incomplete.

[2] The issue before the Court is whether Mr. L. can be sentenced to a custodial disposition pursuant to s. 39(1)(d) of the Youth Criminal Justice Act.
The Ontario Court of Appeal in R. v.
Such cases include those where applying the normal rules would undermine the purpose of the legislation, where the exercise of the unusual power is necessary or required, and where the exercise of the unusual jurisdiction is capable of explanation.
The wording of s. 39(1)(d) is consistent with this approach.
The exceptional power to commit a young person to custody is reserved for those circumstances where, in effect, any other order would undermine the purpose and principles of sentencing set out in s. 38.
The analysis of s. 39(1)(d) must be set against the background of s. 38, which stresses the importance of interfering with a young person’s liberty as little as possible.
In addition, section 39(1)(d) is focussed solely on the circumstances of the offence, not the character or history of the offender.
The circumstances of the offence must be so aggravating that nothing less than custody will satisfy the principles of sentencing contained in s. 38.
The scheme of the YCJA suggests that the circumstances must be so extreme that, “anything less than custody would fail to reflect societal values”.","The parties were married for 14 years and separated in 1995, entering into a detailed Separation Agreement in 1998.
The two children of the marriage are 16 and 8 years of age.
There was a long history of relatively short terms of employment and several moves to take employment.
The respondent had a grade 12 education and some university courses but no practical skills or training.
For the past 3 years, the respondent had made no reasonable efforts for employment, developed no skills of a practical nature, and derived her income from child support payments and the Child Tax Credit and by incurring debt in excess of $20,000.00
The parties had entered bankruptcy during the course of the marriage and had no assets or savings or pension entitlement at the time of separation or acquired since.
The petitioner now earned an annual salary of $115,500.00.
The Agreement did not address the level of child support in accordance with the Federal Child Support Guidelines, nor did it provide for practical retaining by the Respondent to facilitate employment.
This was an exceptional situation that required some adjustment to the Agreement reached by the parties.
The court ordered the establishment of a retraining fund of $6,500.00 with direct payments to whatever institution the Respondent may choose.
Limited spousal support was to terminate on the earlier of completion of the retraining allowance or transfer of the balance of the outstanding to the Respondent on September 1st, 2001.

Plaintiff was found contributorily negligent and liability was apportioned 57.5% to defendant and 42.5% to plaintiff.
Plaintiff suffered significant injuries and plaintiff and spouse applied for interim payment of damages.
Application allowed in part; plaintiff awarded $250,000.00 as interim payment; spouse's application denied.
Once court is satisfied plaintiff has met threshold requirement of a judgment or admission of liability, it must strive with evidence before it to determine what damages are likely to be recovered by plaintiff and may then order interim payment if it thinks just, within limitation that it not exceed a reasonable proportion of the projected amount.
The greater the certainty of the final outcome of liability and the greater the strength of the evidence supporting the damages claim, the higher the proportion of damages that will be advanced.
There is nothing which precludes interim payment from being substantial amount in a proper case but court must be cautious to avoid any influence on eventual outcome of damage assessment.
Although there had not yet been discovery of plaintiff's doctors or an independent medical exam obtained, the plaintiff's injuries were largely demonstrated by clinically objective medical evidence and there was no evidence of any pre-existing condition.
In such circumstances, a substantial sum could be ordered.
Neither pre-judgment interest nor costs are to be considered by the court in such an application.
The evidence in support of the spouse's application was far too incomplete and had yet to be tested by defendants in discovery.

where Rowbotham J.A.","The plaintiff purchased a medical insurance policy from MSI for the time he expected to reside in the USA pursuing studies.
The policy did not cover the periods he would be in Saskatchewan where he ordinarily resided with his parents.
The plaintiff suffered chest pain following a water-skiing accident in August 1997 in Saskatchewan and underwent a thoracostomy for a collapsed lung while in Saskatchewan.
He underwent a further thoracotomy in February 1998 while in the USA.
MSI denied coverage arguing the plaintiff should have postponed the operation and returned to Saskatchewan for the surgery and that, in any event, the condition pre-existed the purchase of the insurance policy.
The medical reports agreed that surgery was necessary.
They also agreed it could be postponed for a time but there was disagreement over the length of any postponement or the patient's ability to travel home given the circumstance of a collapsed lung and the suspected but unconfirmed existence of a bleb.
HELD: The plaintiff was awarded $26,864.46 plus costs, to be taxed.
1)The evidence that travel was dangerous and put the plaintiff's life in jeopardy was accepted.
Therefore the plaintiff was unable to return to Saskatchewan for the surgery.
2)The exclusionary clause did not exempt MSI from liability for payment.
The definition of a 'pre-existing condition' is not clear and does not operate to relieve MSI of its obligation under the policy to extend the benefits in question.

After a trial before a judge of the Provincial Court, he was convicted of the charge.

Besides the complainant and the accused, another person was present at the time of the incident out of which the charge arose.
He is Kim Wall, who was the only person other than the complainant and the accused who testified at the trial.
He was a Crown witness.
The appellant's main contention arises out of what the trial judge said at the conclusion of arguments by counsel:After hearing the evidence that came to the Court, that the Crown evidence is credible and I do not find the Accused's evidence credible.
Therefore I find him guilty as charged.
Mr. Walker argues that the necessary implication is that the trial judge took into account only the evidence of the complainant David Remage and the accused, to the exclusion of Mr. Wall.","The appellants pled guilty to theft over $5,000.

The accused was arrested, his rights were read to him and a breathalyzer demand was made.
At the police station, the accused attempted unsuccessfully to reach three different lawyers.
He ultimately spoke with Legal Aid duty counsel.
In the alternative, the accused submits his rights under ss.

CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE OFFENCE[3] The facts of this case are as set out in the court’s Judgment.
Briefly stated, the accused was found guilty of directly touching, for a sexual purpose with his hand, the vagina of A.M. on more than one occasion between May 20 and December 22, 2005.
The last of these occurred either December 17 or 18 of that year.
A.M. was nine years old at the time and therefore a person under 14 years of age as provided for by s. 151(a) of the Criminal Code.
On all occasions, his touching occurred over and not under A.M.’s clothes.

The underlying action claims damages from the applicant with respect to the construction of a hog barn.
The applicant was the general contractor.
Each of the respondents issued a comprehensive general liability policy to the applicant.
The law is clear that the pleadings determine whether or not the respondents have a duty to defend.
If the claim alleges a state of facts, which would fall within the coverage provided by the policy, the obligation of the insurer to defend is triggered.
The Court reviewed the claim and concluded that the true nature of the claim was that the applicant failed in its contractual duty to construct and deliver a hog barn suitable for the purposes intended.
HELD: The application was dismissed with costs.
 1) It is a fundamental principle of insurance law that a comprehensive general liability policy is not intended to be a means for a contractor to cover the expenses to correct its own faulty or defective workmanship.
They are not performance bonds.
2) The claims in negligence are inseparable from the claims in contract and do not exist but for the contractual relationship.
3) The insuring agreement provided for the payment of all sums the applicant might become legally obligated to pay as compensatory damages because of property damage caused by an occurrence, which was defined to mean an accident.
What is alleged in the underlying action was not an accident or occurrence.

FACTS[2] On April 16, 2005 two officers in separate patrol cars were travelling on Highway 47 northbound towards the Trans-Canada Highway.
They noticed another vehicle with Manitoba license plates travelling in the opposite direction.
It was later determined that this vehicle was being driven by the respondent, Mr. Lundrigan.
Approximately one mile south of the Trans-Canada Highway the first patrol car dropped off a passenger and both police vehicles then turned around and headed back southbound on Highway 47.
Shortly after proceeding southbound, the officer in the first patrol car noticed a vehicle of similar colour to the one she had earlier seen travelling southbound.
She radioed her partner to check it while she turned around to join him.
Highway 47 is not a well travelled highway and the officers wanted to check the parked vehicle to see if any assistance was required.
At the same time as the second officer was receiving the radio transmission he also noticed the vehicle as its brake lights had come on.","This was an application pursuant to The Inter-jurisdictional Support Orders Act for a declaration of paternity and child support.
HELD: By agreement there was an order pursuant to s. 45 of The Children's Law Act, 1997 declaring the respondent the biological father of the child.
The respondent does not currently earn sufficient income to pay child support.
He was to advise the petitioner within 30 days if he receives an offer of employment or contract and if so, the terms of his employment including his gross income.
1) The respondent's ability to earn income is limited by his health to sedentary types of employment.
There is no suggestion or evidence that his pursuit of education is unreasonable.
 2) An individual who chooses to be underemployed or unemployed to avoid paying child support is 'intentionally underemployed or unemployed'.
That is not the only circumstance envisioned by s. 19(1)(a) of the Guidelines.
The Court adopted the reasoning of the Manitoba Court of Appeal in Donovan v. Donovan and the Ontario Court of Appeal in Drygala v. Pauli and found that 'intentional' extends to situations where a parent required to pay child support chooses, for whatever reason, to earn less than they are capable of earning.
The fact that the parent chooses to be underemployed or unemployed, brings their situation within the meaning of 'intentional' and creates the circumstances envisioned by s. 19(1)(a).
The reason for such a choice does not change the fact it is intentional, but it may impact on the Court's decision whether to exercise its discretion and impute income.","[1, 4, 6, 3, 7, 5, 8, 12, 13, 11]"

DECISION Q. D. AGNEW, J (a) This matter came before me pursuant to s. 672.23 of the Criminal Code, to determine the issue of the accused’s fitness to be tried for various offences.
The evidence was heard over two half-days, namely the afternoons of February 7 and April 6, 2011.
(b) RCMc is accused of having committed a variety of offences in December 2008, January and November 2009, as specified in the Informations listed above.
The Crown presented evidence which satisfied me that it has established a prima facie case against the accused regarding those allegations.
(c) RCMc has previously been found unfit to stand trial with respect to the subject Informations.
Accordingly, as the Crown asserts his fitness, the onus is on the Crown to prove fitness on a balance of probabilities.
(e) RCMc is 17 years old.
[5] The Crown provided evidence from Dr. Olubankole Obikoya, a senior psychiatrist at the Saskatchewan Hospital in North Battleford.
The Crown also provided evidence from Dr. Robert John Brown, the chief psychologist at the Saskatchewan Hospital.
I qualified both of these witnesses as experts in their respective fields.
[6] Both of them were of the view that he is not unfit to stand trial, within the meaning of the Criminal Code.","The accused applies by notice of motion to quash the search warrants that were issued authorizing the search of his residence and to exclude any evidence obtained as a result of the search.
The application alleges a violation of the accused's s. 8 Charter rights.
HELD: Although the search warrants relied upon in this case are invalid and the resultant search of the accused's premises was a violation of his s.8 Charter rights, nevertheless, the facts and all the circumstances do not satisfy the Court that the admission of the evidence would bring the administration of justice into disrepute.
The application to exclude the evidence is dismissed.
 1) The Crown stipulated the s. 487 Criminal Code warrant is invalid.
That leaves the validity of s. 11 of Controlled Drugs and Substances Act (CDSA). 2)
The CDSA warrant is invalid in that it does not sufficiently or adequately state the offences in respect of which the warrant was issued.
The search was therefore warrantless.
3) The evidence seized was non-conscriptive and so its admission would not render the trial unfair.
4) There was no bad faith, malice or intentional omission involved in the preparation of the warrants.
The officer was negligent in failing to review the applicable sections and forms of the Code and the CDSA.
The absence of any malevolent intention, while it does not bear on the validity of the warrants, has some bearing in the s. 24(2) Charter analysis.
5) The existence of reasonable and probable grounds to obtain the search warrants to search the accused's residential premises, together with the seizure of $750,000 in cash from the accused's residence as a result of the search, fulfill a number of the circumstances under s. 24(2) of the Charter.","[7, 6, 5, 4, 1, 3, 14, 8, 10, 12, 13, 16]"

McIntyre had purchased some cocaine for a person named Kenny Bear whom he was going to meet in the area of the nightclub.
McIntyre was driving his mother’s Ford Escort station wagon.
McIntyre testified that this is where he met Kenny Bear in order to hand over the cocaine.
[5] McIntyre testified that he then drove west to the end of the strip mall and around the building and, now driving in an easterly direction, drove slowly past the doors of Rockcees.
He didn’t want to hit them and was thus driving slowly.
He testified that he saw and heard Mayer and Dagenais fighting.","The defendant was charged with possession of cannabis marijuana and possession of cocaine, both for the purposes of trafficking.
When the police approached a group of youth standing around vehicles, through one of the vehicle's open windows they noticed two open bottles of beer.
While searching the vehicle for liquor, they moved a knapsack on the floor to check under the seat; the knapsack felt heavy and it felt like there were bottles inside it.
The police opened the knapsack and found beer bottles, narcotics and a large amount of cash.
In the front pocket of the knapsack, the police found the defendant's wallet with identification and personal papers.
They also found packages of cocaine in the console of the vehicle.
The defendant, who was not the owner of the vehicle, was not present when the search was conducted.
The owner of the vehicle testified that he had picked up the defendant in his vehicle earlier in the day and that the defendant had placed the knapsack in the vehicle.
When the police arrived, they both got out of the vehicle and the defendant left.
The defence argued that the evidence was all circumstantial.
The defendant was found guilty on all charges.
The evidence established that the defendant had handed the packages of cocaine found in the console of the vehicle to the vehicle's owner; thus the cocaine was in the defendant's personal possession initially and thereafter in the defendant's and his friend's joint possession.
The knapsack was in the personal possession of the defendant when he entered the vehicle and no one else had access to it until the police seized it; the only reasonable inference to be drawn was not only that the knapsack was in the personal possession of the defendant but that since it contained items of such a personal nature and since the cocaine handed to the friend had come from the knapsack and no one else has access to it, the defendant must have had knowledge of all its contents and consented to them being there.
The three rolls of cash were also in the possession of the defendant and since they were in such small denominations and were found in the same bag as the large amounts of cocaine and marijuana, rolled in the manner in which drug dealers commonly hold their cash, and as the defendant was a student the previous year and therefore unlikely to have large amounts of cash from any other source, the only reasonable inference was that the rolls of cash were the proceeds of drug trafficking.","[1, 6, 5, 4, 9, 3, 8, 13, 18, 11, 2, 15, 10, 22, 21, 19]"
240,"for Chad J. D. DelaittreJUDGMENT ALLBRIGHT J.
In addressing the matter of an appropriate sentence, the Crown suggests that a range of sentences for such an offence runs from a low of fifteen months to a high of four and one-half years.
In this instance, the Crown argues that incarceration should result, somewhere within that range and that under the circumstances of this offence a conditional sentence would not be appropriate.
The defence suggests a range of sentences which is broad, and lower than that suggested by the Crown.
CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE OFFENCEThis accident occurred at approximately 10:30 p.m. on Sunday, July 21, 1996 at the intersection of Albert Street and 3rd Avenue North in the City of Regina.
The intersection is not controlled by traffic lights.
The accused was driving a black 1986 Volkswagen model G.T.I.
and had been travelling along Albert Street from the south side of Regina in a northerly direction.
He was accompanied by a friend, Trevor Leibel.
Alcohol does not appear to have been in any way involved in the accident, and a breathalyzer reading taken approximately one and one-half hours after the accident revealed no alcohol in the blood of the accused.
Conflicting accounts of the driving leading up to the accident and the accident itself have been provided by various witnesses.
The following is a summary of the observations of those witnesses.","The plaintiff in a rear end motor vehicle accident applied for summary judgment and an interim payment.
The defendant argued that there was an arguable issue to be tried in that even if one accepted the plaintiff's evidence, there was the issue of contributory negligence to be considered.
The defendant also argued that he did not see any brake lights on the plaintiff's vehicle and thus there was an issue as to whether or not they were working.
Application for summary judgment granted as to liability with damages to be assessed; application for interim payment dismissed.
There was no 'air of reality' to the defence; to strike the plaintiff's vehicle from behind on these facts meant that the defendant was travelling too close or didn't have proper care or control of his vehicle.
However, the affidavit evidence showed that there were several other factors affecting the plaintiff's health besides the injuries sustained in the motor vehicle accident; serious issues existed between the parties at to whether or not the plaintiff's injuries sustained in the motor vehicle accident resulted in any ongoing inability to work in any capacity; any amount of assessed damages which might be arrived at would largely depend upon credibility and the medical evidence at trial.","[1, 5, 3, 4, 10, 9, 7, 14, 15, 11, 12, 13]"

Introduction [1] Constable Daniel Lariviere was charged with assaulting Stanley Severight with a weapon, to wit: pepper spray, contrary to s. 267(1)(a) of the Criminal Code.
A judge of the Provincial Court of Saskatchewan found him guilty of the offence and granted him a conditional discharge with a probation period of nine months (unreported reasons, dated October 28, 2008).
On appeal to the Court of Queen’s Bench, a judge of that Court quashed his conviction and ordered a new trial (2010 SKQB 360 (CanLII)).

In March 2005, this Court made an order fixing the parties incomes and providing for ongoing support for this son of $129 per month.
The sole issue is whether these orders should be made retroactive.
HELD: It is fair and equitable to terminate the respondent's obligation to pay $670 per month for the oldest son effective August 2004 and to make the petitioner's support payments for him retroactive to that date.
 1) This Court favours an approach to retroactive child support that leaves the decision to the discretion of the Court.
In exercising that discretion, the Court must keep in mind the objectives of the Guidelines and take into consideration the circumstances of each individual case. 2)
The Court must consider whether the application is interim or final, the objectives of the Guidelines, the same factors should apply to retroactive orders whether they increase or decrease child support and whether they are pursuant to federal or provincial legislation, and the individual facts of each case must be considered to ensure that parents are jointly responsible for the support of their children and the principles of fairness and equity are met.
If the Court decides to order retroactive support then, pursuant to s. 15(6.1) of the Divorce Act, it must do so in accordance with the Guidelines. 3)
By February 2004, the respondent had written to the petitioner, putting her on notice that he wanted the payment to terminate because the oldest son was residing with him.
The petitioner refused even though the son had very little contact with her.
There was no justification for the payment to continue.
It is difficult to understand her failure to provide support for this son while at the same time insisting on the continuation of the respondent's payment for that same son, who was spending no time with her.","[3, 1, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 7, 8, 16, 4, 15, 6, 14, 22, 5]"

The Crown appealed the disposition imposed on B.D.L., a young offender, following his guilty plea to four Criminal Code offences.
The four offences were: (i) escaping lawful custody, contrary to s. 145(1)(a); (ii) stealing property valued at more than $1,000, contrary to s. 334(a); (iii) dangerous driving, contrary to s. 249(1)(a); and (iv) possession of stolen property valued at more than $1,000, contrary to s. 355(a).
For these offences, B.D.L.
received, in total, a five months closed custody disposition on October 17, 1994 concurrent to a nine month open custody disposition previously imposed on September 17, 1994.
Shortly after B.D.L.
started to serve his nine month open custody disposition, he escaped custody.","The plaintiff claims damages for injuries sustained when he was punched in the face and knocked unconscious by the defendant.
Liability is admitted.
The plaintiff applies for summary judgment pursuant to Rule 485 of the Queen's Bench Rules.
The parties agree that damages should be assessed on the basis of the affidavit evidence.
HELD: 1)
The defendant pled guilty to a charge of assault causing bodily harm.
He was sentenced to a fine of $1,500, placed on probation for 18 months and ordered to make restitution to the plaintiff for the cost of the dental work in the amount of $3,263.30.
2) The plaintiff suffered serious injuries and significant pain for a number of months after the assault.
Extensive dental treatment was required and will be required at some point in the future.
The plaintiff has minimal scarring.
He is awarded general damages of $12,500.
3) The pleadings and the affidavit evidence do not support a substantial award for aggravated damages.
However, the photographs graphically depict the extent to which his appearance was altered.
Hurt feelings can reasonably be inferred from the fact that the plaintiff was rendered unconscious on the ground in a crowd of onlookers.
These circumstances justify an award of aggravated damages in the sum of $2,000.
4) The plaintiff was awarded special damages in the amount of $1,911.70.","[0, 2, 1, 4, 6, 7, 8, 3, 9, 5]"

The Government is entitled to know the case it has to meet.
If the plaintiff knows the statute and regulations on which he relies, he must provide particulars.
If he does not have particulars of the statutes and regulations, he must so state.
2) The court was not prepared to strike the phrases 'without limiting the generality of the foregoing' and 'without limitation'.
The conduct of examination for discovery and undertakings can provide the defendant with particulars of allegations to be made by the plaintiff in order to permit it to properly defend the action.
 3) The Government demanded full particulars of the breach of trust and breach of fiduciary duty.
The plaintiff's response does not lay a foundation for either and the paragraphs are struck.
 4) The court was satisfied that exemplary damages and punitive damages were synonymous and therefore only one of them should be pled to avoid confusion.
The court directed that any reference to exemplary damages should be read as to include punitive damages and that only one phrase should be used. 5)

IN THE QUEEN'S BENCHJUDICIAL CENTRE OF MOOSE JAW BETWEEN:HER MAJESTY THE QUEEN - and - ACHIEL VAN DE WIELE Walter A.
Wall for the CrownMichael Megaw for the accusedJUDGMENT SCHEIBEL J. September 25, 1996 [1] The accused has been convicted of sexual assault.
[2] The Crown, in seeking a sentence of 2 1/2 to 3 years, categorizes this offence as rape.
They indicate there was no prior romantic connection between the victim and the accused, and that she pleaded with him not to do this.
The Crown point out the victim suffered bruising and soreness from the incident.
[3] The Crown submit that the victim incurred the displeasure of the community and lost her job because the community chose the accused's interest over hers.
In addition, the Crown states the victim was harassed and had her property damaged and was forced to go for counselling.
[4] The accused claims the victim lost her job because of her inability to satisfactorily perform her duties and that it had nothing to do with the sexual assault.
[5] The accused refers to the new sections in the Criminal Code with respect to alternative measures of sentencing and requests that he be given a non-custodial sentence.","The parties were married for thirteen years and had four children, who resided with the mother immediately following the divorce.
The father paid one monthly sum ($6,000) comprised of both spousal and child support.
Over a ten year period, all of the children had graduated from high school; two of the children had moved in with the father and he provided support directly to the other two children while they continued their education.
After the first two children moved out of the mother's home, the parties orally agreed to reduce the child support payments.
The parties were unable to negotiate a further reduction in the combined child and spousal support after the third child moved out of the mother's home.
Since the parties' separation and divorce, the mother had not seriously pursued any educational retraining or furthered her education in her field of expertise; since the children had become independent, she occupied herself with volunteer work.
The father now applied to terminate spousal support.
The father shall continue to pay the sum of $3,000 per month as spousal support for one year; for the following year, the support will be reduced to $2,500 per month; in the following year, support shall be reduced to $2,000 per month, after which support will cease completely; the father shall continue his direct support of the children remaining dependant as they complete their current courses.
Although the mother's effort in looking after four children and her absence from the workplace during the children's early years were significant factors, she had ignored her responsibility to move towards some sort of self sufficiency; given the number of children, the court extended the formula under the Spousal Support Guidelines beyond the maximum 13 year period; however, the mother must develop a reasonable strategy immediately to ensure that she either begins work in an area with better employment prospects or immediately attends courses to upgrade, refresh or enhance her ability to support herself.","[0, 1, 2, 5, 4, 7, 3, 6, 8, 9, 10, 13]"
246,"SINGER, J [1] In this case evidence was led on the trial proper and on a voir dire pursuant to an application under s. 24(2) of the Charter to exclude evidence allegedly because of a breach of the Accused’s rights under the Charter.
The primary defence of the Accused is one of identity.
I will deal with that first.
[2] I have had an opportunity to review the transcript of evidence and the argument of counsel and would like to thank both counsel for your informative and helpful briefs.
I have also reviewed all of the evidence in order to determine whether the Crown has proven, beyond a reasonable doubt whether the Accused was the operator of the motor vehicle at the requisite time.
I will briefly summarise the facts that I have found and the reasons for finding those facts.
[3] The police got involved with the Accused as a result of a complaint of Ms. Anna Krakowetz.
She assumed the driver of the car was the Accused as she was sure the vehicle was his.
She then went outside and the vehicle left, again she only saw the back of the driver’s head and assumed, but could not be sure, it was the Accused.","The appeal is from an order granting interim custody of a 10 year old girl to her father, notwithstanding that the child had been in the custody of the mother since the mother and father separated about 4 years ago.
During the separation the father paid some maintenance for the child pursuant to an agreement made by the parties themselves, and had extensive access to the child, she spending at least one weekend a month with him, as well as the summer holiday.
HELD: Appeal allowed orally.
 1) The oral reasons of the Family Court judge granting interim custody to the father were not available to the court, so it had no reasons for the decision available to assist it in the review of the decision.
2) The appeal must succeed.
Even assuming the Investigation Record was admissible into evidence by reason of the agreement of the parties, and that the psychologist's report was admissible into evidence under s. 97 of The Queen's Bench Act, both of which propositions are at least arguable, there is no evidence other than unsworn hearsay evidence upon which it could be found that the mother was alcoholic and that the child suffered from it, while there is sworn evidence from the mother denying that to be so, as well as sworn evidence from three other persons supporting the mother's evidence to at least some degree.
The father's affidavits are the only sworn evidence filed in support of his case.
It is apparent that the father had no personal knowledge of the mother's drinking habits during the past four years, nor any personal knowledge of how the mother cared for the children. 3)
It is apparent that none of the authors of the documents supporting the father's position that the mother is an alcoholic and is not properly caring for the child (the Investigation Record and The Drug and Alcohol Assessment Report) had any personal knowledge that that is the case.
The information conveyed is nothing more than the opinion of the authors based on hearsay, namely information obtained by third parties, the only one identified is Ms. Tindall.
One is left wondering why no one sought to obtain an affidavit from her.
4) Hearsay matters in the father's affidavits should not have been considered.
The report were not sworn or verified under oath.
 Thus Rule 603(3) does not apply to them, and to the extent that they were based on hearsay, they should not have been considered.
Without the hearsay evidence, there was no case for even the direction of a trial of the issue, let alone an order in favour of the father.","[2, 5, 7, 10, 3, 4, 1, 6, 12]"

[1] This appeal was allowed from the bench with brief written reasons to follow.
These are the reasons.
[2] The appeal is from an order granting interim custody of a 10 year old girl to her father, notwithstanding that the child had been in the custody of the mother since the mother and father separated about 4 years ago.
During the separation, the father paid some maintenance for the child pursuant to an agreement made by the parties themselves, and had extensive access to the child, she spending at least one weekend a month with him, as well as the summer holiday.
[3] In late December, 2005, while the child was with her father for the Christmas holiday, the father filed and served a petition for custody of the child as well as a motion for interim custody pending the hearing of the petition.
He further alleged that the mother was an alcoholic and as a result did not properly care for the children.","FIAT: The applicant applies for an order pursuant to Rule 30(1) of the general rules under the Bankruptcy and Insolvency Act setting aside the decision of the registrar upholding the disallowance of the applicant's claim as a secured creditor in the proposal.

The court considered the registrar's analysis in this matter and can find no fault with his reasoning.
The registrar's interpretation is supported by the legislation and, based upon the undisputed facts which he found, the interpretation is reasonable.

[1] On the hearing of this appeal, we dismissed the appeal with costs, with full reasons to follow.
These are the reasons.
Background [2] The appellant agreed to purchase a two-storey condominium unit (Units 5 and 6) from the respondent, a developer.
Building permits had not been obtained, nor had condominium titles been raised, at the time the sale agreement was entered into.
Schematics or drawings of the project were shown to the appellant at the time of sale.
The respondent opted not to proceed with the two-story unit, revising it instead to a single story unit (Unit 5) which was then offered to the appellant at a proportionately reduced price.
The appellant did not accept the offer, and registered a miscellaneous interest against the title to the entire parcel of land on which the subject warehouse stands.
At the time of registration of the appellant’s interest, the condominium plan had not yet been approved.
[4] The appellant sued for specific performance of the agreement and, in the alternative, damages.","The plaintiff claims damages against the defendants Tim Sullivan and Sullivan Instrumentation (collectively 'Sullivan') for breach of an employment contract when Sullivan was employed by the plaintiff to perform services for PCS at the mine.
The issue is whether Sullivan breached his employment contract by submitting a proposal to PCS when he was still employed by the plaintiff.
HELD: 1)
There is nothing wrong with Sullivan setting up his corporation with a view to starting a competitive business after his employment with the plaintiff ended.
An employee must be free to plan his future after his employment with his employer ends.
He did not prepare the proposals during working hours.
He prepared them with the assistance of his wife, when he was off work in Regina.
However, it has been held that an employee who submitted a bid in competition to his or her employer during a period of working notice was in breach of the employment contract.
Therefore, Sullivan breached his duty of fidelity to the plaintiff.
2) However, the Court was not satisfied that the plaintiff proved it would have been in a position to perform further work for PCS if Sullivan had not submitted a proposal.
There were no union members available for it to hire.
It had no employees ready to perform the contract.
It would appear the plaintiff had abandoned any thought of continuing the contract until the end of December.
If he had pulled employees from another contract, he would have suffered no damage.
3) Sullivan was not in a managerial position with the plaintiff.
He did not possess any confidential information or trade secrets.
He knew nothing as to the profit margins of the plaintiff.
He did have business experience but not confidential information or a trade secret.
4) The plaintiff in this case is entitled to no more than nominal damages in the amount of $500 plus costs.","[3, 1, 5, 4, 7, 8, 14, 11, 2, 12, 10]"

[1] It will not be necessary for us to call upon counsel for the respondent, Ken Yaganiski, for each of us is of the view that, even if his conduct constituted a breach of the clause of the contract prohibiting him from soliciting the customers of the appellant, Belterra Corporation, Belterra failed to prove any loss attributable to the breach.
[2] In light of the view we take of the matter, it is not necessary for us to decide whether Mr Yaganiski’s conduct amounted to a breach of contract, although on balance we incline to the opinion it did.
Assuming it did (which is to put the case for the appellant at its highest), Belterra has not satisfied us that it suffered any loss attributable to the breach.","The parties have two children, a son born March 1990 and a daughter December 1991.
A trial on the issues of the son's residence in 2006, the parties' income for the purposes of child support and any s. 7 expenses was held.
HELD: 1) From September 2006 to February 2007 the parties shared custody of the son.
This is a period of no more than 5 months.
Thereafter he resumed living with his grandmother and was supported by his mother.
The father does not meet the threshold provided for in s. 9 of the Guidelines.
 2) The father's income from employment shows earning of $108,629.
The mother's income consisted only of investment income of $1,672.37 and allowance of $2,000. 3)
The parties have been divorced since 1998.
The son has played baseball since 2004.
The daughter has speed skated since 2001.
The mother has paid the extraordinary expenses of both children, without reimbursement from the father.
It was only in 2006 that the father paid any of the son's expenses.
Accordingly, 2006 is not the appropriate year to begin reimbursing the father for expenses he may have paid for him.
To do so would be exceedingly unfair to the mother who has borne the expenses of both children on her own for many years.
 4) The children's expenses related to fees, registration and equipment for baseball and speed skating are extraordinary expenses within the meaning of s. 7 of the Guidelines.
The expenses may be estimated at $2,000 for baseball and $1,000 for speed skating, annually.
The orthodontic work, which is estimated at $2,522 should be amortized over two years.
The alternative acne treatment, proposed by the mother for the daughter is not an appropriate health related expense in the absence of a medical referral or prescription.
The father's proportionate share is 80% and the mother's is 20%.
Paid monthly the father's payment is $284. 5)
Although the mother did not bring an application to vary child support upward, the filing of the application to vary by the father is sufficient to re-determine the issue of child support based on current incomes.
The current support order is based on the father's income of $87,794.
His income is considerably higher now.
His child support payments are adjusted accordingly.","[1, 0, 2, 3, 4]"

He appeals his conviction and sentence.
Conviction Appeal[2] The grounds of appeal with respect to the conviction are as follows: 1.
The evidence does not support a guilty verdict for dangerous driving.
2.
That the learned Trial Judge misinterpreted the law with respect to the required elements that must be proven when considering a charge of ""dangerous driving.""
3.
That the learned Trial Judge erred when he applied the test of R. v. Stellato to the ""marked departure"" consideration that the Supreme Court of Canada in R. v. Hundal [1993], 1 C.S.R.
867, held to be the prevailing test when determining whether driving can be termed ""dangerous"" according to the Criminal Code of Canada.
[5] There must be such a marked departure from the standard of care of a reasonable person that it can be said beyond a reasonable doubt that the driving was dangerous.
(See R. v. Rajic (1993), 1993 CanLII 3423 (ON CA), O.J.","FIAT: The respondent applies for an interim order granting her sole custody of the parties' two children and child support retroactive to the date of separation being October 2005.
The petitioner seeks joint custody with specified access.
The petitioner acknowledges an obligation to pay child support but there is an issue with respect to his income and whether the interim order should be retroactive.
The children are ages 3 and 2.HELD: 1) Section 3 of The Children's Law Act 1997 provides for a presumption of joint custody where parents of a child have cohabitated after the birth of the child.
That is the situation here.
There is nothing in the evidence to rebut that presumption on an interim basis.
In making interim orders, the Court tries to disrupt the lives of the children as little as possible.
The status quo in this case is represented by the verbal agreement between the parties entered into after their separation.
That is the petitioner would have the children every third week during his week off from Saturday to Tuesday.
This seems reasonable on an interim basis.
This agreement did not address the fact that the petitioner shall be laid off for two months in the spring.
It is reasonable that during this period his contact with the children should be increased.
The petitioner has not seen the children for 10 months.
He will have to be re-introduced to them.
A phase in period is required. 2)
The petitioner has worked for the same drilling company for about 6 years.
His gross income in 2006 was $112,064.
This is verified by his year to date income statement from his employer.
The petitioner attests that $9,600 of his income is a 'living allowance' paid to cover expenses for his truck, fuel, vehicle maintenance and meals and should be deducted from his Line 150 income to arrive at his current income for child support purposes.
This is a matter for the trial judge who will have the benefit of the 2006 tax return and notice of assessment and better evidence of the expenses and their purpose and make any retroactive adjustment deemed necessary.
The petitioner's income for child support purposes is $112,064. 3)
The claim for retroactive child support is a claim for child support payments which pre-date service of the notice of this application.
The petitioner was served with the application in September 2006.
The petitioner lived up to the parties' verbal agreement to pay child support of $1,200 per month starting October 2005.
He unilaterally stopped paying child support in January 2006.
He attests that his reason for doing so was because he was not having access to the children.
The obligation to pay child support is not contingent on a payor's ability to see their children.
 The respondent's income is substantially less then that of the petitioner's.
The child support was necessary to meet the children's basis ongoing needs.
The petitioner knew he had an obligation to provide child support and there is no evidence that a retroactive order would cause him undue hardship.
There is evidence that a request for change in child support preceded the commencement of this application.
A retroactive adjustment of child support to January 2006 is warranted.","[0, 1, 6, 2, 7, 5, 9, 8, 10, 15, 12, 16, 3, 11]"

[1] The appellant appealed his conviction for dangerous driving to the Court of Queen’s Bench and, having failed, then appealed to this Court.
He was convicted at trial on the basis of the testimony of his estranged wife and their daughter, whose accounts of what occurred were accepted by the trial judge.
The trial judge found both to be credible witnesses.
He also rejected the appellant’s account, finding that he was not a credible witness.
[2] The appellant was represented at trial by experienced counsel, but took the appeals himself.
[3] He contends that he was the victim of a miscarriage of justice inasmuch as he has evidence that his estranged wife, out of a desire for revenge, had lied about what occurred.","Accused pleaded guilty at opening of trial to one count of distributing child pornography in the form of written works.
The accused was active on a pedophile website and posted 11 stories describing sexual activity between men and infants and pre-teen girls.
HELD: Accused received 15 months imprisonment followed by 3 years of probation with addition orders including providing DNA samples and being added to the Sex Offender Registry.
The Court accepted that the internet has led to the accelerated proliferation of child pornography, making it an increasing social problem.
The social harm of such material is borne almost exclusively by infants and children, the most defenceless members of society.
For this reason, denunciation and deterrence are the dominant sentencing principles.
The defence submitted that the writings do not actually harm children in their making and, therefore, should not be subject to the same denunciation as pornographic images.
The Court rejected this argument because it cannot be assumed that the writings do not stimulate the demand for images and since not all pedophiles are voyeurs only some will act on their desires and anything that stimulates this desire places children at risk in the real world.
Aggravating factors in this case were 1) the fact that the accused extolled pedophilia and wrote hard core child pornography and encouraged others to the same.
2) The accused was a high profile contributor to the web site and he remains unrepentant Ã» he does not believe there is anything wrong with writing these stories and only stopped because the law requires it.
A conditional sentence would not represent sufficient denunciation or deterrence.
Mitigating factors in this case included a lack of criminal record, the guilty plea and the fact that the accused is looking after his elderly mother.","[2, 0, 3, 1, 4, 5, 6, 7]"

1) Taking into account the mitigating factors and in particular the respondent's post-sentence rehabilitative potential and the absence of evidence of prior acts of violence, a sentence slightly below the range as the one imposed in R. v. Bighead, 2003 SKCA 44 leads the Court to conclude a sentence of 6 years is appropriate, with 26 months credit for remand as imposed below.
 2) The sentencing judge was directed to a very narrow range of authorities.
In these circumstances this Court cannot find that the judge failed to give proper weight to the gravity of the offence and the degree of the respondent's responsibility.
It would be helpful if a more detailed analysis along the lines suggested in R. v. Laberge (1995), 165 A.R. 375 had been given in order to enhance meaningful appellate review.
However, this Court is not satisfied the judge failed to properly consider this factor.
The Court is satisfied that the limited framework presented by counsel led the judge to err by failing to observe the need for parity in sentence and as a result, the sentence imposed was not similar to sentences imposed on other offenders for similar offences committed in similar circumstances.","[0, 1, 2, 3, 4]"

Introduction [1] This appeal concerns the extent to which the principle of qualified privilege applies to defamatory statements made by a union regarding a member of the employer’s management.
He fixed a provisional award of damages of $25,000 (see: 2010 SKQB 249 (CanLII), [2010] 12 W.W.R.
271).
[2] I have concluded that the trial judge erred by finding the defamatory statements are protected by qualified privilege.
I would allow the appeal and fix general damages at $100,000.
II.
Background [3] The parties to this appeal are Dr. Stan Rubin on the one side and the Canadian Union of Public Employees, Mr. Glenn Ross, and Mr. Sam Nowaselski on the other.
He is the appellant in this appeal and the respondent by virtue of a cross-appeal.
I will refer to him by his name.
[4] At all relevant times, Mr. Ross was the President of the Union, and Mr. Nowaselski was the senior grievance officer for the Union.
Mr. Ross and Mr. Nowaselski played integral roles in preparing and publishing the defamatory statements in question on this appeal.
For ease of reference, I will refer to the Union and Messrs. Ross and Nowaselski collectively as the Respondents.
[5] The defamatory statements arose in this context.
Bowman, played a central role in what transpired in this case.","The respondent Homeowners sued the respondents Sebastian and the TWC alleging negligence or breach of contract for failing to obtain the coverage for insurance as instructed by the Homeowners.
Sebastian and TWC issued a third party claim against the appellant SGI and claimed SGI was negligent or in breach of contract or contributory negligence pursuant to the Contributory Negligence Act for failing to issue a policy of insurance in accordance with the application submitted to SGI by Sebastian on behalf of the Homeowners.
The trial judge concluded Sebastian and TWC were negligent and liable for the loss suffered by the Homeowners.
Further, the trial judge concluded that the insurer, SGI, owed a duty of care to both Sebastian and TWC and the Homeowners to properly underwrite and deal with the application for insurance.
The trial judge concluded SGI contributed equally to the Homeowners' loss by 'their negligent acts' and was responsible to pay 50% of the judgment.
The negligence of Sebastian and TWC is not disputed in this appeal.
The Homeowners have been paid the amount owed under the judgment and advised they have no interest in the matter and did not participate in the appeal.
SGI appeals and submits the trial judge erred in determining that SGI: (a) owed a duty of care to the insureds, Homeowners, and to the broker when it received an application for insurance in 'all the circumstances'; and (b) breached its duty of care.
HELD: That portion of the judgment finding that SGI is liable for 50% of the damages payable to the Homeowners is set aside and the Third Party Claim is dismissed.
Accordingly, the appeal is allowed with costs to the Appellant.
The trial judge correctly placed the duty of care on the intermediary, Sebastian.
It is clear the insurer relies on the broker to apply for the coverage in accordance with his clients' (i.e., the insureds') wishes and needs.
There was no other evidence before the Court to establish the standard of care, the basis for imposing a duty at law where none has previously existed, or the subsequent breach of that duty by the insurer, SGI, in connection to the application for insurance submitted by Sebastian.
The Court concluded there was nothing in this transaction which warrants the creation of a duty of care owed by the insurer to a broker applying for insurance on behalf of his clients.","[7, 15, 2, 12, 18, 8, 24, 5, 6, 3, 9, 17, 13, 14, 10]"

(Orally)[1] We do not need to hear from you, Ms. Paulsen.
[2] We are all of the opinion that this expedited family law appeal must be dismissed.
[3] The appellant Nicole Clavelle appeals from an order of Ryan-Froslie J. which directed that Danelle, the daughter of the parties, shall attend kindergarten in Saskatoon during the seven week period before the trial fixed for February 21, 2005.
For convenience we reproduce the following passages from her written reasons: A pre-trial management conference is set for October 5, 2004, after which a trial date will be set.
It is likely that the trial will proceed in December, 2004 or January, 2005.
It must be kept in mind that the application for variation does not relate to a final order, but rather an interim one.
Interim orders are meant to be temporary until the matter can properly be adjudicated.","The petitioner is a 39 year old nurse.
She is legally married to Mr. McPhail and together they are the biological parents of three children.
The petitioner separated from Mr. McPhail in October 2001 after the petitioner became romantically involved with the respondent, Dr. Hunt.
The petitioner and the respondent began cohabitating sometime between November 2002 (according to her) and September 2003 (according to him).
They separated in July 2008.
The petitioner now commences a petition in which she claims relief from the respondent, Dr. Hunt, under The Family Property Act, The Children's Law Act, 1997 and The Family Maintenance Act, 1997.
The three issues to be determined on this application are whether the petitioner has established a prima facie case that the respondent stood in loco parentis to the children such as to justify an interim child support order, whether the petitioner has established that she is entitled to interim spousal support and whether the Court should order an interim distribution of matrimonial property in favour of the petitioner in the amount of $20,000.
HELD: 1) The petitioner has fallen short of establishing a prima facie case that the respondent stood in loco parentis to the children.
The Court cannot make a determination based on conflicting affidavits.
The determination will have to be made after trial.
2) There is no dispute the parties cohabitated as spouses for in excess of 2 years and that she is a spouse by virtue of the legislation.
The principles in Marcotte v. Marcotte, 2008 SKQB 223 apply to the present case.
In 2008 the respondent reported income of over $267,000, he has the ability to pay.
The petitioner has annual income of over $71,000.
Although the parties had a combined income of over $350,000 while they were together, it appears that their assets after their liabilities are deducted will result in a minimal net worth.
The Court concludes that the petitioner is in need of some financial assistance, albeit not to the degree that she has suggested.
A modest transfer of funds from the respondent to the petitioner should alleviate the majority of her negative cash flow problems.
The petitioner's cohabitation with the respondent can only be described as short term.
A spousal support payment of $1,500 per month is an appropriate interim amount.
The payments will be paid for a total of 8 months.
 3) Paying any money to any party at this stage does not meet the criteria set forth in the decisions of this Court.
It is far from certain whether any money will be flowing from the respondent to the petitioner.
The application for an interim distribution of family property is dismissed.","[4, 1, 3, 0, 8, 7, 6, 9, 2, 5]"

BACKGROUND[2] Mr. Dubelt was convicted on April 4, 2006 of common assault.
At his trial he was assisted by Richard Klassen.
Mr. Dubelt paid Klassen $2,500 for his assistance on the assault charge.
Following his conviction Mr. Dubelt utilized the assistance of Klassen in preparing a notice of appeal in which the grounds are related to factual issues.
[3] Mr. Dubelt abandoned Klassen and retained the services of a member of the Law Society of Saskatchewan for the purpose of filing an amended notice of appeal disclosing the grounds of appeal as follows:1.
The Appellant says that due to the ineffective assistance of his trial counsel, there was a miscarriage of justice that compromised the reliability of the trial’s result or caused procedural unfairness to the Appellant.
2.
Such further or other grounds as the Appellant may advise or as may appear from the transcript of the sentencing proceedings.

They were together for eight years, and had two children (ages six and three).
The husband had interim care and sought sole custody/primary care, while the wife wanted shared custody (50/50).
She alleged the husband was abusive.
The evidence showed she unreasonably refused to cooperate with him in relation to matters concerning the children.
Sole custody/primary care to the father, with access to the mother as per the interim arrangement (every second weekend and other times).
The mother was not credible and her allegations of abuse unfounded.
If a party expects the court to believe there was domestic abuse, their position on parenting should reflect that.
Shared custody arrangements require cooperation and the ability to jointly plan.
Similarly, joint custody requires a level of cooperation.
A requirement to make decisions jointly is not in the children's best interests if it leads to conflict and creates a potential power imbalance.
Looking at the nature and extent of the parents' conflict, sole custody is appropriate until there has been an established track record of respectful parenting.","[5, 1, 2, 11, 8, 24, 4, 22, 23, 14, 10, 30, 6, 3, 31, 0, 12]"

FACTS[4] The facts, which are not in dispute, may be summarized as follows.
On August 25, 2003, Westfair was operating a grocery store in Melville, Saskatchewan under the trade name of Extra Foods.
Josh is a 16-year-old test shopper employed by Health Canada.
He was accompanied by DeLee Grant, a Tobacco Enforcement Officer (“Ms.
Grant”), during this compliance check.
Kristy was the 16-year-old sales clerk working that checkout counter.
On the day in question, she was asked by Josh for a package of Players Light cigarettes.
Kristy got the package of cigarettes out of a locked cabinet.
Westfair relies on the statutory defence of due diligence.","The litigation revolved around a claim by the plaintiffs for damages that resulted from a motor vehicle accident.
The plaintiff alleged damages from injuries in a statement of claim issued in 2006.
In 2010, the defendant insurance companies made a demand for particulars seeking production of documents listed in the plaintiff's Statement as to Documents, most of which related to determining the extent of the plaintiffs injury.
Counsel for the plaintiff opposed the application and suggested the issues were for discovery.
HELD: The purpose of Queen's Bench Rule 139 is to provide the defendant with sufficient particulars to comprehend the nature and extent of the plaintiff's claim and respond with an intelligible statement of defence.
Rule 164 allows a defendant to make a demand for particulars and disclosure of documents to assess the merits of the case, assess the merits of settlement and to prepare for examination for discovery.
In this case, the defendants are entitled to know the current medical condition of the plaintiff prior to discovery because they might need further medical examinations, medical opinions and the assistance of an accident reconstructionist or mechanic to prepare to represent their client at the discovery.
The plaintiff was granted 40 days from the date of the order to reply to the demand for particulars.","[6, 1, 0, 4, 5, 3, 12, 11, 7, 10, 9, 17, 16, 13, 15, 22, 21, 19, 28]"

A. Bailey for the respondentJUDGMENT ROTHERY J. April 19, 2004 [1] The appellant, Ernest Montgrand, appeals the calculation of his income replacement benefit made by the respondent, SGI, as provided by Part VIII of The Automobile Accident Insurance Act, R.S.S.
1978, c. A-35 (the “Act”).
Under s. 198 of the Act, a hearing was held to determine certain facts.
Montgrand is entitled to an income replacement benefit.
[2] Counsel for Montgrand estimates that he ought to receive an income replacement benefit (“IRB”) based on yearly wages in excess of $50,000.
This position is based on employment promised to Montgrand which would have commenced during the first 180 days following the accident.
Counsel for SGI submits that the weighted average approach in calculating Montgrand’s gross yearly employment income (“GYEI”) sets the IRB much lower.
Over the previous three years, Montgrand earned no more than $12,000 per year.
[3] The Act provides for a calculation of IRB for the first 180 days after the accident, and for the 181st and subsequent days.","The judge declared the defendants could pay legal fees from third party loans without offending two prior execution orders that prevented them from disposing of any property.
The declaration was explicitly made on the assumption that the loans would not be secured against the defendants' existing assets.
Later, the defendants' counsel wrote to the court essentially indicating he could not confirm the loans would not be secured against any assets.
The court issued this supplemental decision.
In the absence of any evidence the loans will not be secured against assets already subject to the execution order, or will not otherwise reduce those assets, the order and declaration sought can no longer be granted.","[0, 1, 2, 5, 6, 8, 9, 10, 3, 11, 13, 4, 12]"

The Minister argued that given the extensive past history of the three older children, the Minister properly apprehended the infant and the permanency planning committee was of the opinion that there was no use putting off the inevitable permanent order for the child.

The Court dismissed the charge of care or control over .08 after a non-suit application.
During re-examination of the final Crown witness, and after the defence had concluded its cross-examination of the witness, it became apparent that the disclosure package given to both the Crown and Defence did not include the bottom portion of the Intoxilizer Operator's Checklist because it had been cut off during photocopying.
During the defence cross-examination, the officer testified that he could not recall if the accused had slurred speech.
In re-direct, the Crown showed the officer the original Intoxilizer Operator's Checklist and the officer confirmed that it listed slurred speech in the observations section.
 The accused applied for relief under s. 24(1) of the Charter alleging a breach of his right to make full answer and defence.
HELD: The defence lawyer did not know the full content of the Intoxilizer Operator's Checksheet until after he had completed his cross-examination of the author of the document.
The Court was satisfied that if the defence lawyer had been aware of what was noted in the document, he would not have challenged the officer on his failure to mention that the accused's speech was slurred because he would have been able to predict that such a question would result in re-direct by the Crown.
The accused suffered actual prejudice in his right to make full answer and defence and a breach of s. 7 is made out.
While the Court cannot attribute bad faith to either the RCMP or the Crown, the Court was satisfied that the prosecutor referred to the original checksheet during its re-examination of the officer without taking sufficient time and care to ensure that the original was what had been disclosed to the Crown and Defence.
This is an exceptional case where the lack of full disclosure and the time at which it was discovered rendered the trial unfair in a way that can only be remedied by excluding the evidence under s. 24(1).","[2, 3, 4, 1, 5, 6, 7, 8, 0]"

Introduction [1] After Orlando Jose Gonzales (“Mr.
Gonzales”) pled guilty to two counts of sexual assault, Currie J. declared him to be a dangerous offender and sentenced him to an indeterminate sentence.
Mr. Gonzales appeals from this sentence.
[2] Mr. Gonzales contends that during the dangerous offender hearing Currie J. failed to give adequate consideration to the assessment of the two expert witnesses who both recommended that he be declared a long-term offender instead of a dangerous offender.
[3] For the reasons that follow, I dismiss the appeal.
Currie J. was not bound to accept the assessment of the experts.
He gave more than adequate reasons for questioning the foundation the assessments were based upon.
This finding, combined with his review of all of the evidence, is more than sufficient to support his conclusion that there was no “reasonable possibility of eventual control of risk in the community”.

Background Facts [4] The predicate offences that led to Mr. Gonzales being classified a dangerous offender were two sexual assaults.

In January 2011, the parties agreed to a weekly co-parenting arrangement.
In April 2013 the petitioner was advised by the respondent that she and the children had moved to Melville.
Up until that point the child had always resided in the La Ronge area and attended only one school.

IN THE QUEEN'S BENCHJUDICIAL CENTRE OF REGINA IN THE MATTER OF THE LABOUR STANDARDS ACT, R.S.S.
March 23, 1998[1] The appellant (""Cajon"") seeks an order quashing the decision of an adjudicator made following a hearing pursuant to s. 62.1 and 62.2 of The Labour Standards Act, R.S.S.
1978, c. L-1.
The grounds relied on by Cajon give rise to the following issues:(1) Did the adjudicator err in law by finding that the respondent Kovach by her conduct had not frustrated or fundamentally breached her employment contract?
(2) Whether the adjudicator exceeded his jurisdiction by holding that Cajon, as Ms. Kovach's employer, had an obligation to attempt to resolve place of work difficulties that prohibited her from reporting to work?
Facts[2] The Director of Labour Standards ordered Cajon to pay its employee, Ms. Kovach, the sum of $1,500.00 in lieu of a proper notice of termination.
Cajon appealed the order whereupon a hearing was conducted before an adjudicator pursuant to s. 62 of the Act.
Dirk Silversides, the adjudicator appointed to hear the s. 62 appeal, upheld the director's order.
Cajon then launched the appeal now before the Court.
The record before the Court is limited to the adjudicator's decision and the exhibits filed.","Civil Procedure – Pleadings – Statement of Claim – Striking OutCivil Procedure – Queen’s Bench Rule 7-9
The plaintiffs commenced an action against the defendants that included three causes of action: a claim against Xtreme Mining and Banga for wrongful dismissal; a claim for defamation brought against Banga; and for inducing breach of contract against Potash Corp.
The defendants, Xtreme and Banga, brought an application pursuant to Queen’s Bench rules 7-9(1), (2), and 13-8 for an order that portions of the statement of claim be struck out as immaterial.
The plaintiffs included in their pleadings regarding the first cause of action paragraphs that described the details of the plaintiff Bell’s business and real property, which he owned before he was hired by the applicants.
Regarding the plaintiff’s pleadings respecting the second cause of action, they included details of the plaintiff Bell’s health condition at the time he was dismissed from employment.
The plaintiffs pleaded a description of the contents of a meeting between them, Banga and his legal counsel in connection with the second cause, which, if proven, would establish that the plaintiffs were not responsible for acts of intimidation and that the defendants dismissed the plaintiffs for an improper and malicious purpose.
The facts were material to the issue of wrongful dismissal and defamation.
The other paragraphs that were considered immaterial by the applicants dealt with remarks made by Banga to the media.
HELD: The court dismissed the application with respect to the plaintiffs’ pleadings about the plaintiff’s prior business and health condition.

(orally)[1] The appellant has appealed an order granted in Queen’s Bench (Family Law Division) on January 3, 2003 which reads in material part: 1.
The Respondent’s income is found to be $83,611.00.
Therefore he should pay child support for Jeffrey John Bogdan, born on November 9, 1980 commencing September 1, 2002 in the amount of $633.00 per month.
2.
The Respondent shall pay 79% of the following Section 7 expenses which are found to be necessary and reasonable: Bus pass $ 49.00 Physio $ 103.74 School bag $ 113.00 Sport & lab book $ 84.90 Stats.
3.
Should the income of either party change subsequent to this Order the Respondent’s share of future Section 7 expenses shall change accordingly.
The Respondent shall pay costs to the Petitioner in the sum of $450.00Following issue of this order, the respondent took enforcement proceedings.","Family – Child Support – Arrears – Appeal
The appellant appealed from the decision of a Queen’s Bench judge ordering him to pay retroactive child support to the respondent in the amount of $21,645.
The order indicated that the period in question would include support from January 2009 to August 2012 (see: 2014 SKQB 334).
An original support order was issued by consent in 2006.
It required that the appellant pay the respondent $1,220 per month in child support and that the parties would exchange their financial information yearly in order to adjust the amount of child support payable.
In 2008, the appellant applied to vary the order because he had lost his position and his income was reduced to $1,500 per month.
In his affidavit, he swore that his annual income would be $18,000.
The application was allowed and the amount of support reduced to $769 per month based upon the judge setting the appellant’s income at $55,000 and directing him to provide his financial information to the respondent each year.
One month later in 2009, the appellant regained his former employment position and began earning as much as he had in 2008 but he continued to pay $769 per month without informing the respondent of the change in his circumstances.
In February 2011, the respondent served a notice to disclose.
The parties met and made an oral agreement that the appellant would pay $950 per month based upon the appellant’s claim that he was still financially strapped and the respondent acquiesced because she was unwilling to engage in further court battles with him.
The appellant’s lawyer provided the respondent’s lawyer with financial information that showed that the former was earning a substantially higher income.
The respondent also indicated to the appellant that she would forgo about $7,200 in arrears.
The terms of the agreement were submitted to the court, without the financial information or the respondent’s forbearance to sue, and a variation order was issued based upon them.
In July 2012, the respondent applied to vary the 2008 order and the 2011 variation order claiming arrears from January 2009.
Eventually the issue of retroactive child support went to trial.
The trial judge found that the appellant had not given the respondent financial information as was required and his failure to inform her of the material change in his circumstances in 2009 constituted blameworthy conduct.
The appellant’s income for the years 2009 through 2012 was assessed by the court and the amount of arrears established.
The appellant argued that: 1) the trial judge did not have the jurisdiction to vary the 2011 variation order.
He maintained that the 2011 order was final and could not be varied on an interim basis; 2) it was necessary to find a material change in circumstances before it could be varied; 3) the respondent had been advised of the change in circumstances; and 4) the trial judge had erred in failing to find unreasonable delay on the part of the respondent.
 HELD: The appeal was dismissed.
The court held with respect to each issue that: 1) a court can vary an interim or a final order on an interim basis for child support under the authority of ss. 15 and 17 of the Divorce Act.
Although it might be necessary in some cases to determine whether an order is final or interim, it was not necessary to do so here because the nature of the terms of the orders in question and the circumstances surrounding the granting of the 2011 variation order.
The trial judge had not erred in concluding that he had authority to vary it and to order the appellant to pay arrears before the agreement and compelling him to pay the Guideline amount for the period following it; 2) the terms of the 2011 order left it to a future court to finalize the amount of child support based upon the appellant’s income.
Therefore the court retained the power to vary or rescind the order without searching for a change in circumstances; 3) the trial judge’s findings of fact on this point were supported by the evidence; and 4) the trial judge found that the respondent had not received disclosure and thus there had been no unreasonable delay.","[1, 2, 0, 4, 3, 5, 7, 6, 8, 10, 11, 13]"

CameronWAKELING J.A.
(oral)[1] The appellant seeks to have the support payments ordered by the chamber judge increased on the basis the income of the respondent was incorrectly estimated and should have been found to be much greater.
[2] The respondent’s income is largely the product of the operation of a relatively small farm, augmented by some outside earnings.
The appellant seeks to have the respondent’s income increased by adding the value of unsold grain on hand and 100 percent of his capital cost allowance.
[3] There is clearly no basis for adding the value of the grain on hand to the income of the respondent.
There is no indication of any underhanded or inappropriate action on the part of the respondent and this grain is therefore to be viewed as part of the gross income of the respondent in the year in which it is sold.","Family Law – Custody and Access – InterimThe petitioner and the respondent had four children during the course of their marriage.
They separated in 2010 and the petitioner applied for interim orders, including arrangements for the parenting of the children.
The court made an interim order that the parties would have joint custody with the primary residence of the children to be with the petitioner.
The respondent would have access at reasonable times and on every other weekend.
The parties reconciled for two years but then separated again.
In 2012 the petitioner applied for an order enforcing the 2010 interim custody order.
At that application, the court found that both parents were capable of parenting, but in the short term it confirmed terms of the 2010 order.
A number of pre-trial conferences were held without resolving matters, and during that time, the parenting arrangements changed substantially.
The oldest child began residing with the respondent in December 2014.
In December 2015, the second oldest child began residing with the respondent.
They stayed with the petitioner on alternate weekends.
The applicant then brought this application for an order pursuant to ss. 23(1)(a) and (e) of The Children’s Law Act and pursuant to the 2012 court order, confirming the original interim order that the four children of the marriage have their interim primary residence with her and that the respondent have specified parenting time on one day each week and alternating weekends.
The petitioner alleged that the respondent was attempting to influence the two youngest children to reside with him.
HELD: The court ordered that the status quo parenting arrangement should remain in place until trial.
In this case, the status quo was not the arrangements as they had been in 2010 and in 2012.
The court found that the arrangements had evolved since the 2010 order by agreement of the parties and the changes had not occurred because the respondent was attempting to alienate the children from the petitioner.","[0, 2, 3, 1, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]"

The appellant was acquitted after trial in the Provincial Court of communicating with another person for the purpose of engaging in prostitution, contrary to s. 213(1)(c) of the Code.
However, on appeal to the Court of Queen’s Bench, a new trial was ordered, and it is from that judgment that this appeal arises.
There is no need, in view of our disposition, to conduct an extensive review of the facts.
A police officer, on duty as an undercover person, had a conversation with the accused which formed the basis for the charge.
The Queen’s Bench judge concluded that this was an error in law and cited as a correct test a comment in R. v. Schmidt (1987), 1986 CanLII 3096 (SK QB), 53 Sask.","Criminal Law – Assault with a WeaponCriminal Law – Defences – Self-defence
The accused was charged with assault by threatening to use a weapon, a butcher knife, contrary to s. 267(a) of the Criminal Code.
The accused was panhandling outside a store when he and one of two security officers had a verbal confrontation.
The accused walked towards the security officer with a butcher knife.
The security officer ran to his vehicle and the accused followed him and slashed a tire on the security officer’s vehicle.
The attending officer was directed to a yard where he located the accused.
A knife was also located in the yard.
A videotape from the store was entered as an exhibit and played for the court.
The accused was considerably smaller than either of the security officers.
The accused testified that he was homeless and had a lot to drink the day of the incident.
He indicated that he “blacked out” and was in front of two security officers when he came to.
He said that he offered them a cigarette for being in their personal space and one of the men told him that he would punch him out.
The accused indicated that he got the knife out of the bag just to show the men that he was bigger than them.
He said that he did not intend to stab them.
At one point the accused admitted following the security officer to his vehicle and at another point said he did not.
The accused said he then tried to get away from the area but was prevented from doing so by a large black vehicle.
The accused said he eventually stabbed the vehicle’s tire because it was blocking his way and he went into panic mode.
The accused raised the issue of self-defence.
HELD: There was no question that the Crown established the offence beyond a reasonable doubt.
The court found that the accused initiated the confrontation by walking up to the security officer and getting very close to him.
The court found that the Crown witness’s evidence was preferred over the accused’s where it differed, namely the slashing of the vehicle tires.
The court accepted the accused’s submission that the security officer told the accused to get out of his face or he would knock him out or something to that effect.
The court considered the factors set out in s. 34(2) and concluded that the force or threat faced by the accused due to the size of the security officers and the words used by one of them did not warrant the action taken by the accused.
The court offered numerous reasons for the conclusion: the accused initiated the confrontation; the security guard did not touch or further go after the accused; no physical force was used against the accused; and there was no history between the accused and security officer.
The accused’s actions were out of proportion to any reasonable response to any threat.
The court held that the Crown established, beyond a reasonable doubt, that the facts and circumstances of the case did not give rise to the defence of self-defence.
The accused was found guilty as charged.","[1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 0]"

I.
Introduction [1] The appellant, Taryn Rathgeber, was charged on a four count information in connection with an alleged impaired driving incident.
He contended the information was a nullity because it contravened s. 789(2) of the Criminal Code.
The Provincial Court trial judge severed the count which was the source of the difficulty.
Mr. Rathgeber then sought an order from the Court of Queen’s Bench quashing the trial proceedings.
That application was dismissed and Mr. Rathgeber appealed to this Court.
We dismissed his appeal with oral reasons following argument.
II.
Background [2] On November 26, 2008 Mr. Rathgeber was charged with four offences on information 24292894.
The offences were impaired driving, fail to comply with a breath demand, obstruction of a peace officer and operating a motor vehicle while disqualified.
The latter count specified that he was disqualified “by reason of an order pursuant to ss.
253 and 254 of the Criminal Code.” The text of the information is set out below: Charge No.","Civil Procedure – Queen’s Bench Rules, Rule 3-72, Rule 3-84Statutes – Interpretation – Enforcement of Money Judgments Act, Section 5, Section 8
The proposed plaintiff, Alternatifbank (Abank) applied pursuant to Queen’s Bench rules 3-72 and 3-84 to be added as a plaintiff to the action of the plaintiff, Sekerbank, against the defendants and to amend the statement of claim.
ABank asserted a debt claim against the defendants.
The defendants applied pursuant to s. 8 of The Enforcement of Money Judgments Act (EMJA) to terminate the preservation order, which prohibited any dealings with 850,000 shares, or alternatively they sought an order reducing the number of shares subject to the order and requiring the plaintiff to post $3 million as security pursuant to s. 5(7) of the EMJA and $40,000 security for costs.
Regarding ABank’s application, it argued that its claim in debt against the defendant arose out of the same transaction based on the allegation that Arslan transferred the shares to a trust (the other defendant was the trustee) in June 2013, the time at which he stopped paying his debts in full and thus denied it the opportunity to collect its debt.
ABank sought the same relief as Sekerbank: judgment against both defendants under The Fraudulent Preferences Act and The Fraudulent Conveyances Act.
The defendants argued that the limitation period that applied to ABank’s claim had expired and the application should be denied.
Regarding the defendants’ application, they argued that the plaintiff’s strategy in the Saskatchewan action was to await the outcome of the proceedings they had initiated in Turkey against the plaintiff.
The Saskatchewan action was independent from the Turkish action, and the plaintiff’s approach was unacceptable in the circumstances of the preservation order made against them in 2014.
The plaintiff had not prosecuted its actions against them without delay as required by s. 5(c) of the EMJA.
The defendants asserted that the share prices increased since 2014 and were now worth $18 million more than the plaintiff’s claim.
If the preservation was not terminated, they requested that the number of shares be reduced to 100,000.
HELD: The proposed plaintiff’s application was granted.
The defendants’ application to terminate the preservation order or to reduce the number of shares subject to the order was dismissed.
The court ordered the plaintiff to post $1 million as security under the EMJA and an additional $40,000 as security for costs.
The court found that although the limitation period had expired, it would add ABank as a plaintiff and amend the statement of claim pursuant to s. 20 of The Limitations Act, because to do so would not create a wholly new proceeding and the defendants had not provided evidence that they would suffer prejudice.
The preservation order was not terminated after the court reviewed the history of the proceedings in both Saskatchewan and Turkey and found that the plaintiff had not failed to prosecute its action without delay.
The court found that there was insufficient evidence to justify the reduction in the number of shares subject to the order.
 The information of the value of the security fell short of demonstrating a sufficient change in circumstances, especially in light of the addition of ABank’s claim.
The court found that the order should be modified under s. 5(7) of the EMJA to have the plaintiff provide security because there was evidence that the trust may have suffered and could suffer losses in the future as a result of the order.
The order for security for costs was justified based on the considerations specified in Queen’s Bench rule 4-24.","[1, 5, 2, 7, 6, 4, 10, 8, 0, 9, 14, 12, 11, 15, 13]"

The learned trial judge erred in considering evidence that was not admissible on the impaired count in convicting the appellant of operating a motor vehicle while impaired; 2.

The defendants had previously been permitted to re-open judgments obtained against them and had filed defences.
Prior to that they had consistently failed to attend examinations in aid of execution.
Contempt proceedings had been commenced against them but were adjourned sine die at the time the defendants were permitted to defend.
The defendants resisted the application on the basis that they were now non-residents and not compellable by an appointment, and that the designated officer of the defendant corporation was no longer an officer.
This information had not been communicated to the plaintiff's solicitor who had acted in good faith on information given to him previously by the solicitors for the defendants.
The examinations had been scheduled unilaterally because the defendants' solicitor consistently refused or neglected to return phone calls or correspondence from the plaintiff's solicitors.

The Conviction Appeal[3] The charges arise out of a collision in the early morning hours of July 27, 2003, between a truck owned by the appellant and a car driven by Tanya Bergen.
Accordingly, the sole issue at trial was whether it was the appellant or Ms McDermott who was the driver of the truck at the time the collision occurred.

Both the appellant and Ms McDermott had been consuming alcohol for a number of hours prior to the collision.

His sentence was suspended with a one-year probation order.
He appeals from the conviction.
[3] During argument on behalf of the appellant it was suggested that the trial judge made three errors of law leading to the conviction.
One of those errors also amounted to an error of fact; (i) The trial judge referred to photographs depicting the extent, location and nature of injuries suffered by the complainant when no photographs existed or if they did were never tendered in evidence.
This also amounted to an error of fact or mixed law and fact.
(ii) Although correctly articulating the test in R. v. W. (D.), 1991 CanLII 93 (SCC), [1991] 1 S.C.R.

HELD: The imposition of trust conditions on the disclosure of victim's statements and videotaped statements in cases of sexual assault does not prevent the accused from exercising his right to make full answer and defence as guaranteed by ss. 7 and 11 of the Charter.
The obligation to disclose is not absolute.
The Corwn's obligation to protect the privacy of the complainants is fulfuilled by providing the statements and videotapes to counsel for the accused on trust condition that counsel retain them in his possession.
The information contained therein is available to the accused and retained experts for use in preparing his defence.
Since the accused knows the sustance of the complaints and, therefore, the case he has to meet, there is no danger to the fairness of the trial by virtue of the trust condition attached to disclosure.
The public interest is served and the integrity of the criminal justice system is maintained when complainants are assured that staements and videotapes will not be reproduced.

The defendant Margaret Bennett appeals from a judgment for damages pronounced in Queen's Bench.
Since liability was admitted by the defendant (appellant) the trial was limited to assessment of damages by the jury.
As a starting point we recite the verdict form and the jury's answers to the questions submitted to them:[1] A. NON-PECUNIARY DAMAGES:1.
At what amount do you assess the non-pecuniary loss of the Plaintiff, for pain and suffering and loss of enjoyment of life?
At what amount, if any, do you assess the Plaintiff's past loss of homemaking capacity?
$ 0.00B. PECUNIARY DAMAGES:1.
At what amount, if any, do you assess the Plaintiff's past loss of earnings.
At what amount, if any, do you assess the Plaintiff's future loss of earnings.
At what amount, if any, do you assess the Plaintiff's future loss of homemaking capacity.

FACTUAL BACKGROUND Since the appellant's complaints must be passed upon in a factual and procedural context, we find it convenient to first review the relevant factual background.","This was an appeal from the conviction of the appellant that he broke and entered a used car dealership and stole a vehicle, contrary to s. 348(1)(b) of the Criminal Code.
The theft was reported to police by a passing motorist who saw the vehicle being driven off the car lot early in the morning.
The vehicle was spotted on the highway, and when stopped, was exited by two individuals.
Two officers followed tracks through a wooded area, and noted that in two areas the tracks broke through ice on a brook.
Shortly thereafter the appellant came out of the woods on a nearby road; his lower body was wet and chunks of ice and snow clung to his clothing.
The imprint of his footwear resembled that of the tracks in the snow.
The appellant was convicted, based on the doctrine of recent possession.
He argued there was no evidence he was in recent possession of the stolen vehicle.
Dismissing the appeal,
that there was sufficient evidence to support the findings of fact made by the trial judge.
The judgment of the trial judge was consistent with R. v. Kowlyk (1988), 43 C.C.C. (3d) 1 (S.C.C.).","[8, 10, 7, 16, 6, 12, 1, 14, 21, 2, 11, 4, 23, 34]"

March 15, 2013Introduction[1] This is an appeal from a Small Claims Court judgment dated August 20, 2012.
The grounds of appeal listed in the notice of appeal are as follows:a) That the learned Trial Judge erred in failing to weigh necessity and qualification before determining the admissibility of certain opinion evidence tendered on behalf of the Plaintiff.
b) That the learned Trial Judge erred in failing to conduct the trial in a reasonable and just fashion by denying the Defendants an opportunity to make objections from time to time during the trial.
c) That the Learned Trial Judge made a palpable and overriding error in interpretation of the evidence and calculation of damages.
The Learned Trial Judge found the Plaintiff had proven liability with respect to a damaged triple-ply beam, the cost of which was a small part of the Claim.
Answer: Yes - some cracking in the house footing on the north side of the dwelling.

[7] It is from this judgment that the Richardsons have brought this appeal.","The plaintiff had an abortion at a Halifax clinic.
The plaintiff was in the recovery room for 30 to 45 minutes after the procedure, and then left.
On the drive home, she was injured in a motor vehicle accident when she fainted and her car crossed the centre line of the highway and struck another vehicle.
She sued three members of the clinic staff, including the doctor who performed the abortion, alleging negligence in letting her drive after the abortion.
Awarding the plaintiff $724,000 for past and future loss of income, future loss of pension, and general damages,
that based on the evidence of the possible complications from surgery such as an abortion, and considering the emotional impact of an abortion on all women, the defendants breached their standard of care as health care professionals in permitting the plaintiff to drive after the abortion.","[3, 6, 1, 5, 4, 0, 11, 23, 7, 22, 25]"

[1] We have concluded that the order made by the chamber judge striking major portions of the statement of defence and counterclaim of Carry the Kettle First Nation was made in error.
The error consists of a failure to address the merits of the application brought by Ms Thompson to strike the impugned portions of these pleadings.
Having come to this conclusion, we are left to either set aside the order and remit the application to the Court of Queen’s Bench for appropriate disposition or to address the merits of the application ourselves.
In the interests of reducing further cost and delay we have decided to do the latter.
As for the requirements of Rule 173, we are satisfied that, while fraud might have been pleaded more explicitly, having regard for the constituent elements of the tort, the pleading is nevertheless sufficient to answer to the requirements of Rule 173.","Landlord and Tenant - Writ of Possession_____
The landlord applied for an order for a writ of possession pursuant to s50 of the Landlord and Tenant Act.
The 41 month lease required a monthly rental of $500 for the first five months and thereafter semi-annual payments of $5,000.
The tenants had not paid any rent in 1998 nor had they maintained insurance; they installed alternating stalls in the barn in breach of their covenant not to make any alterations or additions to the premises; breached the express and implied covenants to keep the premises in good condition and tenantable repair by their failure to remove and properly dispose of baler twine, to maintain proper weed control or to remove manure buildup in the calf barn.
The tenants admitted the rental payment was due in May but claimed the landlord breached the pre-condition wherein Russell's husband promised to repair the damage caused by a 1995 hail storm.
The claims for repair was far in excess of those provided for in the lease which were the tenant's responsibility._____
HELD: 1)The landlord was entitled to a writ of possession since the tenants were in breach of the covenant to pay rent for more than two calendar months.
2)A trial of the issue was ordered to determine whether the tenants were in breach of covenants in the lease.
The matter should not be decided summarily where there are questions of fact or law.
The hail damage may allow the tenants to claim in damages against the landlord but it could not be construed as a debt due for the purposes of s27 of the Landlord and Tenant Act.
The remaining alleged breaches could not be determined summarily.
 3)Costs of the application were awarded to the landlord in any event of the cause.","[1, 0, 3, 2, 4, 5, 6, 8]"

(Orally) The appellants George Hagblom and George Hagblom Masonry Ltd. apply to adduce fresh evidence and to amend the statement of claim in the within action.
The appellants contend that they instructed the solicitor who was acting for them at the time of the trial (and who is not the solicitor on the appeal) to call certain expert evidence dealing with the causation of the fire which destroyed the respondent's residence.
The appellant's solicitor called no expert evidence concerning either the proper construction of the chimney, which was alleged to be faultily constructed, or the cause of the fire.
The tests for the admission of fresh evidence on appeal are well known and are set out in R. v. Palmer, 1979 CanLII 8 (SCC), [1980] 1 S.C.R.","An application pursuant to s197 of the Automobile Accident Insurance Act for an order setting aside SGI's termination of the applicant's income replacement benefits.
The applicant suffered soft tissue injuries to his cervical spine when his vehicle was struck from behind by an uninsured driver.
He received a partial income replacement benefit from SGI on the basis he was not able to perform some but not all of his farm duties.
HELD: 1)SGI was not entitled to terminate Sawkiw's benefits pursuant to s185(d), (e), (f) or (g).
SGI's failure to make a suitable rehabilitation program available to Sawkiw prior to October 1/97 and its failure to reassess his level of income replacement benefits as at September 14 where significant factors contributing to his desperate circumstances.
SGI was requiring Sawkiw to attend daily physiotherapy of 3 to 4 hours duration with approximately 2-1/2 hours of additional travel time.
It is common knowledge that pain can be exhausting; that daily physiotherapy can be exhausting; that daily travel of 2-1/2 hours can be exhausting; that the physical demands of farming can be exhausting; and, that the mental demands of managing a farm and coordinating and organizing the work of others on a farm can be exhausting.
It was far from clear how SGI expected Sawkiw to devote approximately 6 to7 hours per day to his treatment program and still have the mental and physical reserves to devote any time or energy to his farming oprations.
He could only reasonably be expected to participate in daily physiotherapy if he was receiving a full, rather than a partial income replacement benefit.
2)The benefits were properly terminated pursuant to s129(1)(e) the first day of his full time employment in Alberta.
However, from September 14/97 to the date of termination Sawkiw was entitled to be paid full income replacement benefit without adjustment for a partial return to work.
Sawkiw was entitled to the difference and interest from the date such additional benefits should have been paid until the date of this judgment.
3)SGI was to arrange for an assessment by the rehabilitation centre forthwith.
If it is found that as a result of the accident Sawkiw is not able to hold the employment he held at the time of the accident, SGI is encouraged to consider his condition as a relapse under s142(1)(a).
Under the terms of this judgment the final income replacement benefit will be other than one made pursuant to s139 or 140. 4)Sawkiw was entitled to his solicitor and client costs respecting services rendered and disbursements incurred from the date of filing his notice of motion to the date this judgment is received.
He was also entitled to his costs associated with preparing and filing his notice of motion set at $600 being the maximum amount payable under the Personal Injury Benefits Regulations.","[0, 2, 4, 3, 5, 6, 7, 1]"

(Orally)[1] We have before us a motion by the appellants to admit fresh evidence, which if allowed, mandates a new trial.
[2] At the outset we observe that although this application is in the context of a civil action, it does have significant criminal overtones in that the respondent alleges arson in paragraph four of its statement of defence which reads: 4.
The Defendant says that the fire was not accidental in origin but was deliberately set by a person insured under the policy.
[3] We are all of the opinion that the ""fresh"" evidence of Mr. T.V.
Jones should be admitted and a new trial ordered.","The applicant sustained a lower back injury in an automobile accident in February 1995 which resolved within ten days to two weeks.
In June 1995 he began to experience pain in his back which slowly worsened until he was hospitalized in October 1995.
He was diagnosed with a large central and right sided disc herniation.
SGI denied his claim for income replacement benefits as a non-earner under s.117(1) of the Automobile Accident Insurance Act.
In issue was whether the accident caused the disc herniation.
HELD: The appeal was dismissed.
The plaintiff had not met the onus on him of establishing causation on a balance of probabilities.
Two family physicians supported his contention but the medical director of rehabilitation services for SGI and the orthopaedic surgeon who treated the applicant were both of the opinion the herniation was not caused by the accident.","[0, 1, 3, 4, 5, 2, 6, 7]"

The plaintiff also sought a declaration that it holds builders' liens against the defendant's interest in the Well and other joint interest assets to the extent of the debts due.
Duce Oil denies liability for any costs of the horizontal well in excess of $447,535 being 110% of the authorization for expenditure executed with respect to the Well.
The defendant counterclaimed on the basis the plaintiff conducted certain operations without authority, was negligent in conducting operations and overcharged or made improper charges in its accounting procedures.
HELD: 1)Duce was liable for $96,286.95 representing 35% of the unpaid costs of the original and supplemental authorization for expenditures (AFE) and the costs of the screw pump.
2)Duce was responsible for $49,701.61 representing regular lifting and production costs and other joint interest wells plus expenditures under $25,000 which did not require an AFE.

Westridge was the general contractor.
I[3] Each of the respondents issued comprehensive general liability policies in favour of Westridge.
The respondents take the position that under the policies they issued they are not obligated to defend (and to pay defence costs) for the claims brought against Westridge in the underlying action.
[4] The law is well established that the pleadings determine whether or not the respondents have a duty to defend.
It matters not whether Genex may or may not succeed in the action.
If the claim alleges a state of facts which, if proven, would fall within the coverages provided for under the policy, the obligation of the insurer to defend is triggered, regardless of the truth or falsity of those allegations.
699 at para.
28, in the following terms:28 The starting premise for assessing whether an insurer’s duty to defend has been triggered rests in the traditional “pleadings rule”.
If the pleadings allege facts which, if true, would require the insurer to indemnify the insured for the claim, then the insurer is obliged to provide a defence.
This remains so even though the actual facts may differ from the allegations pleaded.","After being sexually assaulted, applicant was voluntarily released from Canadian Armed Forces.

Hesje for the applicantNo one appearing for the respondents FIAT D.H. WRIGHT J.September 20, 2002 [1] The applicant applied for an order for judicial sale following the service of a statement of claim on the respondents in which it sought foreclosure or alternative relief.
In so doing, it asked that its solicitor, Mr. Hesje, be appointed as selling officer to conduct the sale and report to the Court.
[2] I expressed my concern to Mr. Hesje during the course of his submissions as to the propriety of the applicant solicitor serving in such a dual function.
He informed me that some members of our Court have allowed this to be done, others have declined.
[3] In my respectful view, it is not appropriate for the Court to appoint, as selling officer, the solicitor for the applicant creditor.
There are obvious difficulties with conflict of interest.
Who does the selling officer serve: the Court, from which his or her authority originates; or the client?
[4] The matter is of sufficient importance that I concluded I should reduce my thoughts to a fiat and direct that it be distributed to other members of the Court.","FIAT. The accused applied for an order pursuant to s.581(1) of the Criminal Code quashing count 1 on the grounds it offended the 'single transaction rule'; an order pursuant to ss.7 and 24(1) of the Charter and the common law doctrine of abuse of process that portions of the indictment as amended be quashed or stayed on the basis of the judgment in the trial of the former co-accused, Reginald Schafer; alternatively, an order staying the proceedings on the grounds of unreasonable delay in bringing the accused to trial.
He argued the Crown would be in breach of an agreement in which he waived delay to proceed on the charges on which inconsistent findings could be made and would constitute bad faith.
HELD: 1)The application to quash count 1 on the basis it charges more than one transaction was dismissed.
The count particularizes in the alternative various ways in which the accused is alleged to have defrauded the investors of ICC by using funds of ICC to advance his or Schafer's interests.
The case law cited by both parties clearly establishes that the word 'transaction' as used in s.581(1) is to be interpreted broadly and flexibly, and that a single transaction may, in this sense, include a number of acts or incidents occurring over a period of time.
2)Count 1 of the indictment was to be amended.
The application to stay proceedings on the basis of findings made in the Schafer trial was allowed in relation to the particular charge in subpara.(b) of count 1 regarding use of ICC funds in the amount of $513,000 for Trirak along with subpara.(j) regarding alleged representations to ICC's investors that 30% of their investment would be invested in GICs.
To allow the Crown to pursue these allegations would be an abuse of process.
The Crown had indicated it would not proceed with subparagraphs (c) or (d).
2)There had not been unreasonable delay in light of the complexity of the charges, reasons for the delay, and the agreement by the applicant not to object to certain portions of delay.
There was ongoing disclosure and there were various court appearances following the laying of charges.","[0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11]"

[1] The applicant applies for leave to appeal a decision of the Assessment Appeals Committee of the Saskatchewan Municipal Board on a question of law pursuant to s. 33.1 of The Municipal Board Act.
[1][2] The test on such an application requires there exist a question of law or question concerning the jurisdiction of the Board, doubt whether the Committee’s decision is correct, or there is a question of such broad importance as to warrant the attention of the Court.
[3] The test has been articulated in Shalk v. The City of Regina et al.,[2] by Chief Justice Bayda as follows: 7 As I have noted, leave to appeal may be granted if two prerequisites are satisfied.
The question must be one of law.
It must be one that merits the consideration of the Court.
8 There is no doubt that in the present case the first prerequisite is satisfied.
The questions as I have recast them are clearly questions of law.","The accused was charged with operating an overweight vehicle on a weight restricted road contrary to s.38(1)(b) of the Highways and Transportation Act.
No permit had been issued for the tractor trailer.
The defence argued the document entitled 'order for road restriction on provincial highway #332 pursuant to s.35 of the Highway Traffic Act' was not proof of the Minister's order according to law; even if the document is proof, the order is a 'regulation' under the Interpretation Act and so the provisions of the Regulations Act applies; since those requirements have not been met, the Crown has not established an order had been made for the purposes of this case.
HELD: It was not proven beyond a reasonable doubt that the accused violated s.38(1)(b).
It was not established that the order was published for the purpose of this prosecution nor that the document filed in court is proof of the order itself.
 1)It is well known that in a criminal case a provision that enables the Crown to expeditiously prove certain elements of an offence must be strictly satisfied.
Since a violation of the HTA is prosecuted under s.4 of the Summary Offences Procedure Act, which in turn adopts the Criminal Code summary conviction procedure, the Crown must strictly comply with the provisions respecting proof.
 2)It is mandatory for the Minister to give notice of the order and there was no evidence he exercised his discretion by determining the most advisable manner in which notice was to be given.
The Minister failed to take appropriate steps to cause notice of the order to be given.
The Department of Highways placed road signs warning and advising of weight restrictions on the highway and along grid roads accessing #332, but no notice was given to the general public.
Notifying persons who reside or do business in the immediate area of the road is not sufficient to satisfy the requirement to publish.
3)Even if it could be said sufficient notice was given, it could not be concluded that the endorsement upon the order that the order 'conforms to the original' meets the statutory requirement that the copy must be a certified copy 'under the hand of an officer or person in whose custody the...public document is placed' (s.12 SEA) since it was not known if she had custody of the document or under the hand of any of the persons set out in s.7(c) of the SEA since her official capacity is not described.
The order was not published in the Saskatchewan Gazette and so a copy of the order so published could not be produced (s.7(a) SEA).
It was not proven that the copy of the order had been printed by the Queen's Printer (s.7(b) SEA).","[1, 3, 6, 7, 8, 9, 5, 2, 4]"

Kovatch for Konkrete Construction Ltd.JUDGMENT KRAUS J.December 7, 1999[1] There are several issues to be determined on this application.
Payment of $55,000 to BPG[2] The applicant asserts that the respondent's father's company (the third party) paid $55,000 to BPG, the respondent's company, in contravention of the order of the court made June 7, 1999 directing any funds accruing to BPG to be paid into court, and freezing any money to be paid out.
[3] This is an extremely serious allegation.
The uncontradicted facts are that the third party made a cheque to BPG in the amount of $55,000.
That cheque was deposited to the bank account of BPG on June 8, 1999, and applied by the bank against the overdraft.
The applicant asserts that the third party was served (on May 28, 1999) with notice of the application giving rise to the judgment of June 7, 1999.","This judgment applies to both QBG No. 1040/98 and QBG No. 1041/98 respecting the contract between the city and Triple P Holdings and the January 21, 1997 contract between the plaintiffs and the defendants.
The first breach of contract concerned a failure to apply the rotation of truckers described in the arrangement between the city and Truckers Association.
The second breach alleged the defendants took too many hours on the total contract.
Both matters were tried together.
The defendants pleaded there was no privity of contract between the city and plaintiffs, therefore the plaintiffs could not enforce terms agreed to by the city and Triple P.
HELD: Both actions were dismissed.
1)The case did not turn on the issue of privity.
While the plaintiffs were not actual parties to the contract with the city, certain benefits were intended to pass through the general contract to members of the Truckers Association.
2)There was no contractual obligation in the 1997 agreement which required the defendant to adhere to any particular arrangement on the rotation of work.
The contract between the defendants and city was not incorporated by specific or general reference.
The first sentence of s.9 of the 1997 tender for rental of truck specifications was more consistent with what was actually done by the defendants than with the interpretation put on it by the plaintiffs.
They failed to make out a case that the contract term was as alleged or that any breach occurred.
 3)Had a case been made out, further evidence of damages would be required.
The damages claimed were excessive and did not properly take into account actual operating expenses, the net affect of mitigating factors, and reliable calculation of the administration of the rotation of work.","[0, 1, 2, 4, 6, 5, 3, 8, 7, 9, 11, 10]"

[11] The testator passed away on February 28, 2007.","Issues of divorce, custody and access were disposed of by judgment given during the course of the trial by consent of the parties.
Matrimonial property was to be divided, maintenance for the children and spousal support were to be determined.
HELD: 1)Access was to be mutually agreed upon with the 18 year old to whom the respondent stood in loco parentis.
 2)Expert evidence of tax implications was not called as the respondent failed to give notice as required by the Rules of Court. 3)The mother's annual income for purposes of the Guidelines was fixed at $11,376 not including the $300 child support she received from the natural father of the 18 year old.
The respondent's farming income was determined on a 3 year average as it varied from year to year.
The facts justified adding back 25% of the capital cost allowance on the machinery over the last 3 years for Guideline purposes.
Day care and play school costs of $440 per month were to be divided according to their proportionate share based on the Guidelines.
The respondent was to pay one-half of the cost of extra curricular activities and any future activities as agreed upon.
The approach used in Cook v. Kilduff was adopted and the amount for the two natural children was deducted from the amount payable for three children.
One-half of the difference was added to the Guideline amount of support for the two children.
4)Spousal support was not ordered.
The mother was employed and the respondent's income was not likely to increase in the near future.
Given he paid child support and the extra costs, their income was nearly the same.
5)Of the six quarter sections owned by the respondent prior to marriage, there was no equity in one and the increase in value in the others was marginal.
Credit was given for the reduction in the mortgage debt by $24,000.
There was no interest to be divided in the 1999 crops.
6)The petitioner was awarded judgment for $113,155.19 less $15,580 for assets in her possession and less one-half the appraisal costs.
The judgment was to be a charge on the respondent's land.
The petitioner may apply for judgment for the amount of the loan secured by the van in her possession if the respondent fails to pay off the loan. 7)Each was to pay his or her own costs.","[4, 8, 0, 6, 13, 14, 5, 7, 9, 12, 15, 10, 18, 20]"

The applicant showed reasonable grounds for contesting the validity of the election and the Chambers judge granted the fiat to allow the applicant to serve the notice of motion to determine this matter.
The application under s.19(1) of the Act was filed on December 8, 1997, and the fiat was granted on the same day.
The service of the notice of motion upon all respondents was made within two weeks of the date of the fiat.
But, counsel for the respondents argues that I have no jurisdiction to deal with the motion because the applicant has missed the limitation period for bringing this application.
Section 19(1) of the Act states the application to the judge must be brought ""within six weeks after an election.""
Counsel for the respondents calculates the election to be October 22, 1997.
The fiat was granted December 8, 1997, forty-seven days later.
That is beyond the time limit.
Counsel for the applicant responds that the application is within the time limit because the time limit does not commence until after completion of the judicial recount provided by s. 126-128 of The Local Government Election Act.
Grostky J. completed his judicial recount on October 30, 1997.","The applicant grandparent applied to the Court of Appeal to be made a party to the proceeding so that she could appeal a permanent care order made in respect of her granddaughter.

In a decision dated September 16, 2004, an appeal committee of the University recommended that Dr. Pearlman be allowed to resume his orthopedic residency training program on probationary terms.
This decision has not yet been implemented.
[2] At issue in this matter is a College of Medicine policy governing students who are funded by third party organizations or governments.
Dr. Pearlman was such a student, and for reasons which will be outlined hereafter, his third party funding was depleted during the period of time he was suspended.

She suffered from MS and was unable to work.
HELD: Spousal support was varied to $3,500 monthly.
The only material change in the wife's means and needs is that fact she is residing with a new partner who resides in her home in exchange for yard work and housework.

September 14, 2010 [1] Joseph Kobialko (the ""landlord""), appeals from a decision of a Hearing Officer of the Office of Residential Tenancies, which decision ordered the landlord to pay to Keitha Bitternose (the “tenant”) the sum of $787.13, of which $562.13 represents utilities that the Hearing Officer found the tenant had overpaid and $225.00 which was ordered to be paid as abatement of rent for the tenant’s inconvenience of having to deal with the caretaker’s threats of the water being turned off and for repeated notes from the caretakers.
[2] The landlord’s ground of appeal is as follows:Me as the Landlord, not responsible to pay the utilities - tenant is to pay the utilities; if on social assistance, social services to pay for it.
If I agreeded [sic] to pay the utilities, than it would have been added to the rent.
I had this property for about 30 years and haven’t paid the tenant’s utilities.","The applicant applied for an order for judicial sale following the service of a statement of claim on the respondents in which it sought foreclosure or alternative relief.
 In so doing, it asked that its solicitor, Mr. Hesje, be appointed as selling officer to conduct the sale and report to the Court.
The court expressed its concern to Mr. Hesje during the course of his submissions as to the propriety of the applicant solicitor serving in such a dual function.
He informed the court that some members of our Court have allowed this to be done, others have declined.
In the court's respectful view, it is not appropriate for the Court to appoint, as selling officer, the solicitor for the applicant creditor.
There are obvious difficulties with conflict of interest.
Who does the selling officer serve: the Court, from which his or her authority originates; or the client?
The matter is of sufficient importance that the court concluded it should reduce its thoughts to a fiat and direct that it be distributed to other members of the Court.
To be fair, Mr. Hesje indicated he was perfectly willing to have another member of the Law Society unconnected to the proceedings appointed as selling officer.
The court understood that Grant Richards of Cuelenaere Kendall Katzman Watson &amp; Hagen will serve in this role as opposed to Mr. Hesje.","[0, 3, 1, 4, 2]"

2.Does the taking of security for a loan on the Group Plan contravene the provisions of ss.

The father was granted reasonable access on reasonable notice.
The issue of child support was adjourned sine die with an order that the father provide copies of his income tax returns for the past 3 years.
Issues were whether child support should be retroactive; s.7 expenses; costs.
HELD: 1)The father was to pay ongoing monthly child support of $293 for so long as the child remains a child within the meaning of the Family Maintenance Act.
2)He was to pay retroactive child support of $1,500 in monthly installments of $100.
There must be some justification for retroactive support orders.
This Court followed the approach taken by BC Court of Appeal in L.S. v. E.P., which set out the factors a court should consider in granting retroactive child support.
He should have paid $335 in 2000; $324 in 2001; $293 in 2002.
It was not clear why the petitioner did not seek financial disclosure through the Court.
3)The father was to pay his 59% share of the costs of the music program, gymnastics, swimming and craft camp within 10 days of receiving receipts.
There was no prior spending pattern for the court to consider, as the child had no independent needs and was only 3 months old when the parents separated.
While illness can qualify as a legitimate reason for requiring child care, the illness must relate to the child's custodian, not to a third party.

FIAT. A motion for summary judgment under Queen's Bench Rule 485 governing simplified procedure.
The plaintiff claimed the creditor wrongfully converted monies after a full and final settlement of his account for a lesser sum ($2,000 on a $15,600 account).
He sought punitive damages for 'high-handed and malicious behaviour'.
The plaintiff assigned his future crop insurance benefits and Canadian Wheat Board payments for application to his outstanding account in May 2001.
In June 2001 a farmhand had an accident, while operating his employer's unlicensed vehicle.
An occupant of the other vehicle in the accident was critically injured and died.
The defendant says it was subsequently induced to settle the debt for a lesser sum by the plaintiff's false representation that SGI was suing him for between $200,000 and $300,000; that he would be found liable and would likely make an assignment in bankruptcy, making the account uncollectible.
SGI initiated proceedings against the plaintiff in May 2002 claiming $17,660.
The defendant contended that, if there was an accord and satisfaction, it was avoided due to mistake of fact or misrepresentation.

Brent Gough, for the objecting creditor, the Trustees of the Saskatchewan Student Aid Fund Marla Adams, Deloitte & Touche Inc., trusteeJUDGMENT MAURICE J. HERAUF December 4, 1997 Registrar in Bankruptcy[1] The bankrupt obtained a Bachelor of Science degree in Chemistry and an Advanced Certificate in Science-Physio as a result of student loan funding.
In addition, the bankrupt successfully completed four years toward a degree in Veterinary Medicine.
His reason for not finishing the final year in Veterinary Medicine was that he had obtained the maximum amount allowed by student loans and was financially unable to complete the final year.
As a result of student loan funding, the bankrupt is indebted to Canada Student Loans in the amount of $22,338.99 and Saskatchewan student Loans in the amount of $18,241.39.
The Saskatchewan program has objected to the automatic discharge of the bankrupt.
[2] It appears that student loans represent 100% of the provable claims of unsecured creditors.
To his credit the bankrupt paid a total of $6,074.92 toward his Saskatchewan loan between November 1994 and April 1996.

The bankrupt repeatedly made it clear that he is satisfied with his current occupation and is somewhat reluctant to leave secure employment for uncharted waters.","The plaintiff bought a spreader from the defendant Apollo Distributing Corporation (Apollo).

The proposed dependent adult, Selwyn Roy Hand resists that application.
The following judgment is my resolution of the application and related matters.
BACKGROUNDThe proposed dependent adult, Selwyn Roy Hand, was born on the 4th day of August, 1920 and at this time is seventy-six years of age.
Mr. Hand lived for many years in the Biggar area of Saskatchewan and in 1994 moved to Estevan, where he has established a relationship with Mrs. Annie Minto Essex.
Mr. Cathcart is the nephew of Mr. Hand and while the application is brought in his name, it is in a broader sense an application on behalf of Selwyn Roy Hand's extended family.
Mr. Hand has never been married and has no children.
Mr. Cathcart and other family members, including Mr. Hand's brother, assert that Selwyn Hand has throughout his entire life been mentally challenged.
Mr. Cathcart further suggests that, ""Mr. Hand is gullible and is quite easy to talk into practically anything and could well be easily deprived of his assets"".
He apparently stopped working at approximately fifty-five years of age.
MINES AND MINERALS ACCEPTED by E 4120 as to the South East and South West Quarters of Section 17 and CD 3814 as to the West Half of the North East Quarter of Section 8.
Initially, in 1949, this land was registered directly in the name of Selwyn Roy Hand.","Each party has applied for a variation of the judgment granted by Gunn J. in April 1999.
The judgment incorporates the terms of an Interspousal Contract dated April 1999 that provides for basic child support to be paid by the petitioner in the amount of $1,411 per month.
The calculation of child support in the Interspousal Contract was based on the petitioner earning $110,000.
The petitioner seeks to have child support reduced for Kimberly and discontinued for Ashley.
The petitioner has unilaterally terminated support for Ashley on the basis that she is over 18 years of age and not in full time attendance at school.
The respondent seeks an upward variation of ongoing child support for Kimberly on the basis that the petitioner's income is significantly higher than $110,000.
She also seeks a retroactive variation of support paid for both girls.
HELD: 1)
The parties agree that much of the petitioner's income since the separation has included significant amounts of non-recurring income in the form of capital gains, stock options and severance pay.
In accordance with s. 16 of the Guidelines, a payor's income for child support purposes is determined based on total income, adjusted in accordance with Schedule III, as shown on his or her income tax return.
The petitioner has provided no compelling reason to exclude any of his non-recurring income.
To the contrary, it is the fairest way of proceeding.
The petitioner's income since separation discloses that non-recurring income can realistically be anticipated in the future, as it has constituted a significant portion of his income in four of the last five years.
The fairest way of determining the appropriate level of child support is by calculating it based on his income during the previous year. 2)
The petitioner's line 150 income on his 2003 income tax return was $199,922.
This includes $114,454 of non-recurring capital gain income from the sale of shares in Poplar Hill Resources.
It does not include the non-taxable portion of that capital gain in the same amount.
Pursuant to Clause 6 of Schedule III referred to in s. 16 of the Guidelines, this non-taxable amount is to be included as an adjustment to income.
This results in the petitioner's 2003 income for child support purposes being $314,376.
However, in examining documents provided by the petitioner regarding his previous year's income, it is apparent that he incurred net capital losses in 2002 of $65,424.
The Court imputed $150,000 of income to the petitioner for the year 2002 despite this net capital loss and his line 150 income being only $2,410.
It is therefore reasonable that this capital loss be deducted from the non-taxable portion of the capital gain he realized in 2003.
This results in only $49,030 of the non-taxable portion of the 2003 capital gain being added to income for total income of $248,952.
Based on the Guidelines, child support of $1,928 would be payable for Kimberly.
 3) During the same year that the petitioner was enjoying income in excess of $248,000, the respondent's income for herself and the two children was only $24,345.
It is self-evident that the petitioner has a substantially greater ability to provide financial support for Kimberly than does the respondent.
In the circumstances it is appropriate that one-half of the Guideline amount for the petitioner's income in excess of $150,000 be payable as child support.
Effective January 1, 2004, the petitioner shall pay monthly child support for Kimberly of $1,557.
 4) Ashley did not complete grade 12 until June 2003.
In the normal course, she would have graduated in June 2002, but she was short some classes.
The required classes were not available in September 2002 so she did not return to school until the new semester in January 2003.
Although Ashley was not in full time attendance in school during the last six months of 2002, she had not yet completed her basic education and had every intention of doing so.
She was not in a position to withdraw from her parent's support.
Considering the disparity in the ability of each of her parent to contribute to her support, it is appropriate that support for Ashley be the amount determined by applying the Guidelines as if she were a child under the age of majority.
 5) A written request by the respondent for the petitioner to provide copies of his income tax returns is not required because the parties incorporated a positive obligation to exchange tax returns in their Interspousal Contract.
Consistent with the objectives of the Guidelines and implicit in the Interspousal Contract the parties must have understood that the petitioner's child support obligation could change if his income changed.
6) This is clearly a case where a retroactive variation is warranted.
No variation can be considered for 1999, the year of the Interspousal Contract and the judgment.
Given the various sources of the petitioner's income and the significant annual fluctuations in his income, it is appropriate to use his previous year's income as the basis for calculation of his child support payable in the subsequent year.
The Court went on to calculate the petitioner's income and the child support payable for each year. 7)
In 2002 the petitioner's line 150 income was only $2,410.
Given the pattern of the petitioner's income in the three preceding years, along with the fact that he disposed of capital assets in 2003 that generated undisclosed cash flow, and, some 2 years later, he nevertheless retains significant net assets, the Court imputed additional income to the petitioner of $150,000 for child support purposes. 8)
The respondent was awarded costs set at $2,600.","[1, 0, 4, 3, 8, 5, 6, 7, 13, 9, 11, 16, 15]"

The amount he is required to pay under the 1995 judgment is $2,500.00 per month.
[2] The application before me was triggered by the applicant’s loss of employment and a debilitating leg injury.
[3] The affidavit material filed by the parties indicates that they have different views as to many of the issues involved and their respective needs and means, but neither wanted a trial of the issue.
420.
POSITION OF THE PARTIES[4] The applicant raises two grounds as constituting a material change in circumstances.
The second is that the respondent is now over 65 years of age and receives Canada Pension Plan and Old Age Security Pension benefits.
The applicant acknowledges that he should continue to pay some ongoing spousal support but that it should be significantly reduced.","The parents applied for leave to apply to terminate a permanent care and custody order respecting their three children.
Proposed Notices of Adoption were filed for two of the children after the parents' application was filed but before it was heard.
The order had been made due to, inter alia, issues of poor hygiene and nutrition; lack of supervision; domestic disputes; physical risk to the children due to inappropriate discipline; the mother's explosive temper and mental health; the father's anger; lack of insight, desire or inability to improve by the parents; inability to control themselves during access or exercise access meaningfully and an all-consuming anger and preoccupation with the Agency.
Since the order was made, the mother was diagnosed with and now receiving medication for bipolar and obsessive compulsive disorders.
Application for leave granted; access not ordered at the present time; supplemental affidavits and viva voce evidence were considered given that the parents had only obtained counsel after the application was filed and the nature of the issue at stake; the application could not be arrested simply because the Agency had taken steps to have the children adopted after the application was filed.
Some of the factors leading to the permanent care order were being addressed by the parents, although they had not been fully dealt with; the main achievements so far appeared to be an improvement in the parents' relationship, the courses of counselling and parenting instruction they had embarked upon, an expressed willingness by the mother to undertake psychotherapy, the mother's diagnosis and medication and the parents' changed attitude towards cooperation with the Agency; these are significant building blocks on which to anchor intense parental counselling","[0, 1, 2, 6, 5, 10, 3, 13, 12, 7, 9, 4]"

WILLIAM ALBRITTON in his capacity as Dean of the COLLEGE OF MEDICINE of the UNIVERSITY OF SASKATCHEWAN and DR. GORDON ZELLO in his capacity as Chair of, THE BYLAWS COMMITTEE OF THE COUNCIL OF THE UNIVERSITY OF SASKATCHEWAN representing all members of the said Committee RESPONDENTSCounsel: Andrew M. Mason for the applicant Varinder Sahi Catherine A. Sloan for the respondent University of SaskatchewanJUDGMENT MILLS J. January 28, 2011INTRODUCTION [1] The applicant was an undergraduate medical student at the University of Saskatchewan (“University”), who was required to discontinue his studies for failure to meet academic standards for promotion.
The applicant followed the appeal procedures found in the College of Medicine and University, but was unsuccessful throughout.
He brings this certiorari application to quash a decision of the Academic Appeals Committee of the College of Medicine, and of the University Bylaws Committee of Council.
On the assumption that his applications will be successful, he seeks an order reinstating him as a student at the College of Medicine pending resolution of his appeal.
BACKGROUND FACTS[2] The respondent University provides a useful and accurate summary of the relevant facts which I have paraphrased as follows:a. Undergraduate medical education at the University is a four-year course leading to an MD designation.
A license to practise medicine follows after post-graduate medical training is completed.
b.
For the academic year 2009-10, the applicant was in Phase C of the course.
Due to previous academic difficulties, Mr. Sahi had been required to repeat both Phase B and Phase C, and consequently entered Phase C on probation.
e. Pursuant to College of Medicine processes, the Undergraduate Education Committee (“UEC”) then met and considered the Phase C Committee recommendation.","The accused has been in custody since November 17, 2004.
After show cause hearings, the court refused to release the accused from detention.
The accused apply for a review of the detention orders.
HELD: 1) A review of the detention orders would ordinarily be cursory and the applications dismissed.
The reasons for the decisions to refuse to release the accused cannot seriously be questioned.
2) However, a factor that causes concern is that 6 months after their arrest, not only has a preliminary hearing not been conducted, no date for a preliminary hearing has been set.
No preliminary hearing date will be set before May 2005.
The preliminary hearing will take 2 to 3 weeks.
 It seems unlikely that the trial of these individuals will take place within a year of the date of their arrest.
3) They are ordered released on terms and upon the filing of security in the amount of $1,000.","[2, 3, 0, 5, 7, 13, 8, 6, 4, 9, 1]"

No.
Present counsel for the husband is new to the file, and was not the lawyer involved in the settlement.
2) The wife seeks an order requiring the husband to pay the equalization payment under a consent judgment, or alternatively that the consent judgment be set aside and trial dates ordered.
4) The dispute arises because the wife says she is entitled to $105,000 net (in cash or cash equivalents) with at least $65,000 being the cash composition.
She says this is what the husband said he could borrow.
She says she was not aware the husband had significant RRSPs.
He denies that he ever offered to pay $65,000 in cash.
This offer was rejected.
6) The application initially came before Sandomirsky J. whose comments are recorded on the Court file on April 27, 2012.
He stated: The relief being sought in the notice of motion is somewhat unusual.
You have your judgment and there is a mechanism to enforce it.
The argument is that there is some ambiguity in the language and how to interpret the judgment.
I can’t change the language of the judgment.
I can’t grant you an order saying the judgment says what it says, so obey it.","FIAT: The applicant defendant seeks an order pursuant to s. 10 of The Attachment of Debts Act setting aside the plaintiff's pre-judgment garnishees in which $2,291.90 was paid into court from the defendant's bank account in December 2005.
The issue is whether the plaintiff's claim is a liquidated demand within the meaning of s. 3(1) of the Act, and if so, whether the affidavit filed in support of the issuance of both of the pre-judgment garnishees complies with s. 3(2) of the Act.
HELD: The plaintiff has not strictly complied with the provisions of s. 3(2) of the Act, and the garnishee summons are a nullity.
 1) In an application to set aside a pre-judgment garnishee, the court is not to consider potential defences to the action or the existence of triable issues as grounds for setting aside a garnishee summons.
2) The court examined whether or not the affidavit showed, with the required precision, the amount of the debt or liquidated demand.
Although there is reference in the statement of claim to an agreement that interest would be paid at 2.0 % per month, compounded monthly, there is no mention of interest in the Operating Agreement.
3) Of more concern is the four-page invoice attached to the affidavit supposedly attached to confirm the amount of the debt owed by the defendant.
The invoice is vague and is of no assistance to the court in clarifying the precise amount of the debt owing.
Unlike the information provided in the affidavit of Kuznitsoff v. Hilltop Ford Equipment Sales Ltd. (c.o.b. Hilltop Equipment Sales), wherein the affidavit charted the alleged gross profits by listing the equipment, date of sale, model number, sale price, cost and gross profits on a line by line basis, the contents of the affidavit here is severely deficient in showing with precision the amount of indebtedness owing.","[1, 3, 6, 4, 0, 7, 12, 8, 15, 14, 16, 17, 18, 10, 19]"

70 hired Rodney Dignean to serve as guidance counsellor at its education complex located near Carlyle, Saskatchewan.
In 1990, he became co-ordinator of post secondary education programs and remained in that position until terminated in May 1997.
He now seeks damages for wrongful dismissal.
Until the end of the 1995-1996 school year he was responsible, through the director of education, to the Chief and Band Council.
The board initially took the form of a committee appointed by the Chief and Council.
Relations between Dignean and board members were not good.
[3] Dignean felt that board members were intruding too much into administrative matters rather than concentrating on policy decisions.
Also, they made demands that were difficult to comply with.
Dignean was offended by this and thought it unfair.
This was done upon her recommendation and was authorized by a member of council.

.","The plaintiff company commenced an action against a former employee/shareholder for breach of fiduciary and employee duty.
The shareholder defended and claimed that one of the directors had misappropriated funds from the company.
The shareholder later retained a new solicitor, who successfully applied to amend the defence to withdraw certain admissions and amend the counterclaim to add a shareholder oppression remedy and for leave to bring a derivative action.
The court found that, in the circumstances, the new counsel's assessment of his client's case was sufficient to allow the admissions in the defence to be withdrawn, the implied undertaking against the collateral use of discovery evidence did not apply because the pleaded material facts were the same facts material to the shareholder oppression action and the applicant bore an ordinary onus to establish the three statutory prerequisites.
The court also directed the employee to retain an expert and for the company to pay that expert and make all reasonable disclosure that the expert reasonably required.
The plaintiff company appealed.
Appeal dismissed;
there was evidence before the trial judge on which he could conclude that it was just that the admissions be withdrawn; with respect to the oppression remedies and the employee's status as a complainant, the wording of the earlier consent order could be interpreted as not suspending his rights as a former shareholder; there was a temporal connection between the impugned acts and his ownership of the shares and he had a sufficient interest in the oppression remedies.
The terms the judge imposed were within the broad discretion conferred by the Third Schedule of the Companies Act and there was no breach of natural justice by the imposition of them.","[0, 1, 7, 17, 13, 3, 4, 11, 14, 2, 5, 15, 6, 22, 9, 23, 20]"

I.
Introduction [1] The Applicants, George Forrester, Phillip Scott, Keith Bowers and R. Gary Cooper (the “Applicants”) are defendants in an action commenced by the Respondent, University of Saskatchewan.
They applied to have the University’s claim against them dismissed for want of prosecution but were unsuccessful.
They now seek leave to appeal that decision.
II.
Basic Background [2] The relevant background facts are set out in the decision of the Queen’s Bench Chambers judge now reported at 2011 SKQB 55 (CanLII).
I will outline only their key features.
[3] The Applicants were partners in an architectural firm that provided design drawings and specifications for the construction of the Education Building on the University of Saskatchewan campus.
The building was substantially complete by 1970.
[4] In 1985, some of the stone panels on the exterior of the building fell to the ground.
With respect to the Applicants, the University alleged that its loss occurred as a result of their negligent design efforts.","This is an appeal brought by the R.M. from a judgment of the Court of Queen's Bench determining that a mortgage held by the R.M. was subordinate to a mortgage held by the respondent Farm Credit Canada (FCC), even though the R.M. mortgage was registered before the mortgage of FCC.
The R.M. had agreed with the mortgagor that its mortgage would be subordinate to that of FCC.
The appeal raises the application of the priority provisions of The Land Titles Act, 2000 and in particular the application of s. 54 of the Act.
HELD: The mortgage of the respondent has priority over the mortgage of the appellant.
The appeal is dismissed with costs.
 1) It is not necessary in this case to consider whether the priority provisions of the Land Titles Act are overridden by commercial postponement agreements in mortgages, or whether reliance by the competing security holder is necessary in order to displace the doctrine of privity of contract in relation to a covenant to postpone, for the court consider the matter to be governed by a consideration of the nature of the interest created by the R.M. mortgage in light of s. 54(3) of the Act. 2)
Registration does not and cannot alter the nature of the legal interest granted by the instrument registered.
In the present case the mortgage instrument states that it is pursuant to the prior Grant Agreement executed by the parties.
This agreement, in turn, clearly provides that any security granted by Mainline to the R.M. is subject to the prior security interest of the respondent to the extent of $3,125,000.
In effect, Mainline granted to the R.M. a mortgage of a limited interest, being Mainline's equity of redemption after any mortgage held by the respondent, to the extent of $3,125,000.
The appellant admits that it was never intended, as between itself and Mainline, that it would obtain a security interest in priority to that of the respondent.
Mainline granted a mortgage to the appellant subject to the prior interests, as defined, of the respondent and of CIBC.
The appellant is therefore, seeking to increase the interest actually accorded to it by the debtor by relying on its prior registration and the priority provision of the Act.","[1, 3, 4, 5, 6, 2, 8, 7, 9, 10, 15, 11, 12]"

Unless otherwise directed, the offending party shall pay double the costs to which the other party would otherwise be entitled.
[3] The relevant paragraphs of the amended statement of claim are the following:10.
On or about May 29, 2003, the Plaintiff states that he was operating a motorized lawnmower on his property when he was physically assaulted by the Defendant, Maurice Couture.
During the assault, the Plaintiff was struck in the head with an unidentified object, believed to be a pipe or board.
The Plaintiff states that no words were exchanged between he and the Defendant and the assault was unprovoked.
10A.
With respect to vicarious liability the Plaintiff pleads and relies on sections 12 and 14 of The Partnership Act R.S.S.
1978 c. P-13.
11.
The Plaintiff states that as a result of the assault by the Defendant, Maurice Couture, he has suffered significant injury and endured considerable physical pain.
The Plaintiff claims general damages for pain and suffering, in an amount to be proven at trial.
The Plaintiff claims general damages for past and future loss of enjoyment of life, in an amount to be proven at trial.","The accused is charged with care or control of a motor vehicle while impaired contrary to s. 255(1) and s. 253(a) of the Criminal Code and care or control while over .08 contrary to s. 253(b) of the Code.
HELD: There is no remedy of exclusion of the Certificate of Analysis.
Accordingly, the accused is guilty of care or control while over .08.
The evidence does not prove impairment beyond a reasonable doubt.
 1) It is clear from the evidence that the accused's vehicle was inoperable and immovable due to the damage from the accident and its location in the ditch.
The defence raised the issue of whether a person can be 'in care or control of a motor vehicle' when there is no risk that the vehicle in question can be put in motion so that it can become dangerous to the public.
The Court reviewed the cases.
The first person to come upon the accident scene found the accused alone in the vehicle seated in the driver's seat.
He saw no visible signs of anyone else at the scene.
Upon approaching the vehicle, he observed the accused turn the ignition key to try and start the vehicle.
There was no other evidence which established that the 'accused did not occupy that seat for the purpose of setting the vehicle in motion'.
The accused has failed to rebut the presumption of care or control under s. 258(1)(a) of the Code and the Court finds that the accused was in 'care or control' of the motor vehicle.
2) Considering the case law and after objectively considering all the indicial of impairment known to the officer, together with the circumstances of the accident itself (which indicate driving error) there can be no doubt the officer had more than reasonable and probable grounds to form the requisite opinion pursuant to s. 254(2) of the Code to make a demand for samples of analysis.
 3) The officer was sensitive to the immediate concern of the physical well-being of the accused.
Though he may have formed his opinion in the ambulance, he wisely waited until medical personnel had made an initial assessment at the hospital before making any kind of demand.
In the circumstances, the Court finds the officer made the demand at the first practical opportunity in relation to the entire investigation.
3) The officer, in coming to his conclusion to make a blood sample demand, considered a number of relevant factors, including time limits to obtain a breath sample, the severity and magnitude of the accident, the potential seriousness of the accused's head and neck injuries, the need for immediate emergency assessment and length of time it would take to treat the accused and keep him under observation.
He believed the accused's condition was potentially serious and was completely justified in holding that belief.
The evidence has proven the accused required immediate and emergent medical attention which made it obviously impractical to put the accused before a breathalyzer instrument within the time limit fixed by the Code.
The officer had reasonable and probable grounds to believe that by reason of his physical condition, the accused may be incapable of providing a sample of his breath, or it would be impracticable to obtain a sample of his breath.
All the requirements of s. 254(3) of the Code have been proven beyond a reasonable doubt.
4) The evidence discloses that the police officer made numerous efforts to ensure the accused actually spoke to a lawyer in private.
After that, the accused made no further requests whatsoever to further speak to a lawyer.
Following the principles set forth by the Saskatchewan Court of Appeal in R. v. Leedahl, 2002 SKCA 5, the evidence clearly establishes the accused was coherent and understood the right to counsel enunciated to him by the police officer.
He in fact spoke to a lawyer and made no other requests.
Further, there was no suggestion that the accused was incapable of understanding his right to counsel or that he was incapable or prevented from acting on his right.
To the contrary, the evidence proves the exact opposite.
The Court finds the accused has failed to demonstrate his s. 10(b) right to counsel was denied or infringed in any way.","[2, 5, 0, 4, 8, 7, 6, 11, 9, 12, 16, 13, 14, 20]"

A.
The Committee erred by mischaracterizing, misreading or ignoring the decision of this Court in Harvard Developments Ltd. et al v. The City of Regina et al, 2004 SKCA 103 (CanLII) (the “HDL Decision”), which confirmed the decision of the Board of Revision in appeal 98-520 that the Wascana Energy Building sale could not be used for MAF purposes, when the Committee decided to overturn the Board’s decision to exclude the said sale from the MAF sales array.","These appeals concern a referendum on the question of whether the University of Saskatchewan Student's Union should join the Canadian Federation of Students (the Federation).
The referendum was held in the fall of 2005.
A majority of the students voted in favour of joining the Federation.
The respondent Robin Mowat then applied to the Court of Queen's Bench pursuant to The Non-profit Corporations Act (the Act) and obtained an order declaring the referendum to be of no force or effect.
The Federation and the Student's Union now seek to overturn that order.
They argue that Mowat had no standing to bring his application and that the Chambers judge erred in his application of the relevant statutory provisions.
HELD: The appeals must be dismissed.
1) The respondent is a 'proper person' to bring the application pursuant s. 222(d) of the Act.
He was attending the University and very actively involved on campus and the referendum campaign.
Over 44% of the students voted against joining the Federation.
The Act gives the right to make an application to a complainant, not to a complainant who speaks for a significant portion of the members of a corporation.
The fact that the respondent's application was argued a few months after the respondent had convocated should not defeat his right to bring his concerns forward.
An individual's status as a student is inevitably temporary.
There is no justice in denying the respondent's standing only because the process for reviewing the referendum results played out so slowly that he was unable to bring the matter before a court prior to the date of his convocation.
 2) The Controverted election cases are not applicable in the circumstances of this case.
Section 225 of the Act creates and delimits a statutory remedy for particular kinds of corporate conduct.
The assessment of an application pursuant to s. 225 of the Act must be measured against the concepts of oppression, unfair prejudice and unfair disregard as provided in that section.
Administrative law concepts should be imported into that analysis only with considerable care and only for the purpose of giving meaning to the statutory terms found in the section itself.
3) The critical point is that the Council abandoned a formal process which had been put in place specifically to address the very significant concerns raised by the respondent and other about the referendum.
Whether that turn of events was somehow inevitable is not the real issue.
Rather, the essence of this case is the unfairness and prejudice the Council's decision involved for those who had opposed joining the Federation.
It is unnecessary to look more closely at the specific problems that arose in relation to the referendum process.
The decision of the Student's Union to override the decision of the Elections Board was itself something that warranted the granting of relief pursuant to s. 225 of the Act.","[0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]"

[1] The applicants apply for leave to appeal a decision of Mr. Justice G. A. J. Chicoine wherein he denied the applicants leave to add the Aboriginal Healing Foundation as a defendant and denying the applicants leave to amend the statement of claim by inserting the document entitled “Addendum to the Original Statement of Claim in Support of the Notice of Motion to Amend the above Claim (as per Rule 165).”[2] Arlene Lowery has claimed damages against The Anchorage Counselling and Rehabilitation Services Inc., arising out of her wrongful dismissal.","Decision, following a voir dire, on the admissibility of statements made by the accused to a police officer, beginning with: 'Excuse me, I was in a roll-over accident and I am intoxicated.'
The officer, who observed symptoms of impairment, asked the accused how much he had had to drink and was told he had consumed about 15 beers.
The officer placed the accused under arrest for impaired operation of a motor vehicle, and read him his Charter rights, the Police Warning and a Demand for Blood Sample.
The officer then detained the accused by remaining with him while awaiting the Blood Kit to arrive and for a blood technician to take the blood.
During this time, the officer interrogated the accused about the accident and the accused provided additional information.
The Crown contended that if he was given the police warning then it would be clear to the accused that he did not have to continue to answer questions the officer's questions.
The Defence argued that since the arrest and the blood demand were based upon self-incriminating evidence obtained by breach of the accused's s. 7 rights, the arrest was illegal and all evidence obtained thereafter should be excluded; or, at least, that the information obtained was illegally obtained and the police could not rely on that information to make the demand.
The accused testified that he talked to the police officer only because he believed he had a legal obligation to do so, based on advice he had received from others that there was a legal obligation to report the accident promptly to the police.
The Crown conceded that the accused did have a legal obligation to report the accident promptly, and that if the accused believed he was reporting the accident when he gave self-incriminating statements to the police officer as a result of that belief, those statements must be excluded according to law.
HELD: All of the statements of the accused, including those made after the arrest, are excluded and will not form part of the Crown's case.
The evidence obtained, and the statements, in particular, were self-incriminating and conscriptive.
The officer was acting in good faith, not with serious intentional disregard of the accused's rights.
He was not taking a statement under the Traffic Safety Act.
He did not know that the accused was only saying things because he believed he had to under compulsion of statute.
Even though the investigator did nothing that violated the accused's rights, they were nevertheless violated.
Because the violation resulted in the making of statements that amounted to self-incriminating evidence, following the logic of the case law, it is necessary to exclude those statements.
The accused did approach the police officer with the intention of reporting the accident as is required by the Traffic Safety Act.
As such, and as the Crown correctly concedes, his initial statement, anything said by the accused while providing his personal information and the answer to any question while registering at the hospital are excluded from this trial.
As the self-incriminating statements made under compulsion of statute have been excluded, it follows that any evidence that came about as a result of the officer following up on those excluded statements are also in breach of the accused's s. 7 rights.","[1, 2, 0, 3]"

Treleaven for the respondentJUDGMENT MATHESON J. January 15, 2004 [1] The applicants have applied for an order setting aside the grant of Letters of Administration of the Estate of Helen Pischnot and granting to them Letters Probate with respect to a document, or documents, purporting to be the last will and testament of Helen Pischnot in which they are named as executors and sole beneficiaries.
BACKGROUND[2] The applicants met Helen Pischnot in September, 1996.
The second hand store operated by the applicants was less than a block from where Helen Pischnot resided.
[3] In December, 1996, Helen Pischnot became ill.
[4] In February, 1999, Helen Pischnot fractured her hip.
The applicants transported her to the hospital, where she was confined for two months.
The applicants visited Helen Pischnot in the hospital three times each day, and looked after her house and cat.
On the hospital social work referral form it is stated, under the heading of Next of Kin, “no family”, but the plaintiffs were listed as “friends”.","A youth was arrested and charged with possession of a stolen motor vehicle after the vehicle arrived near the location of a pre-arranged drug transaction.
The youth was later charged with possession for the purposes of trafficking after a strip search conducted at the police station resulted in a quantity of crack cocaine being removed from his underwear.
A voir dire was held to determine the lawfulness of the strip search and the admissibility of the cocaine seized.
The evidence is admissible; there was no breach of s. 8 of the Charter and, in the event that there had been a breach of s.8, the admission of the evidence would not bring the administration of justice into disrepute.
The strip search was incident to arrest and conducted in a reasonable manner, being reasonably quick and non-invasive.
There is nothing in the Youth Criminal Justice Act or the common law which requires that young persons be afforded the opportunity to consult with counsel or a parent or guardian prior to a search.
This was real evidence, the admission of which would not affect trial fairness; any breach was conducted in good faith; the search was motivated by a sense of urgency; and significant efforts were made to respect the privacy and personal integrity of the young person.","[0, 1, 4, 3, 6, 2, 8, 7, 10, 5, 13, 11, 12]"

Business Centre Inc. (""VIP"") or 598710 Saskatchewan Ltd. (""Sask.
Ltd."") on such conditions as the Court deems proper.
Facts[2] Bennett Properties Limited (""Bennett"") owns an office building municipally described as Hanselman Plaza (""the Plaza"").
By written agreement Bennett extended the VIP head lease to August 31, 1999.
Each applicant entered into a written sub-lease of office space with VIP for a term of 50 months ending on August 31, 1997, and an optional renewal term of one year upon three months' notice.
Only a copy of the sub-lease between VIP and Capital Properties was put in evidence.
Bennett agreed to pay all relocation costs.
[4] In para.
[5] VIP and the applicants relocated their premises but thereafter never prepared and executed renewals of their sub- leases.
Similarly, no renewal of the head lease was ever prepared.
Paragraphs 4 and 5 of the agreement provide:4.","The mother of two boys, ages 12 and 13, applied to vary access to add a condition that the father only be allowed to drive with the boys in the HRM, on roads with a speed limit of 80km/hr and under.
She asked the Court to continue conditions that prevented him from consuming marijuana less than 8 hours before driving, and required him to consider the boys' wishes regarding access and transportation.
The father argued that all restrictions relating to the transport of the children should be removed.
The father had MS, and a medical marijuana licence.
His driving was evaluated yearly, and the report arising from the latest evaluation did not appear to address his marijuana use.
An independent assessment of the children's wishes showed they enjoyed time with their father, but worried about his ability to drive under the influence of marijuana.
The unrepresented mother sought costs.
Conditions continued; variation granted.
If he leaves the HRM, the father is to arrange for public or other transportation.
Costs awarded to the mother in the amount of $800.
In terms of the driving issue, it was not fair to place the entire burden of the transport issue on the children.
The Court was not satisfied from the evidence that the father's marijuana use was benign, and there was also a concern about the symptoms of his MS, especially on long trips.
While in the HRM, if the boys became concerned about driving with their father, they could take a bus home or call their mother.
If outside of the HRM, it would be more difficult for them to get home.
In terms of costs issue, the mother was the successful party.
Although she was unrepresented, she did have to take considerable time off work.
She was also inconvenienced because the father was late in filing documents, despite having been given clear time-lines by the Court.","[1, 0, 2, 6, 8, 4, 14, 7, 21, 11, 3, 5, 9, 28, 16, 26, 25, 13]"

FACTS[3] The plaintiff claims that he was physically assaulted and that he suffered the loss of his traditional language and culture from 1944 until 1952, when he was attending the Qu’Appelle Residential School near Lebret, Saskatchewan (the “Residential School”).
The Attorney General acknowledges that the plaintiff attended the Residential School from February of 1946 until June of 1949.
[4] The plaintiff claims that the physical assaults were perpetrated by employees and staff at the Residential School.
[5] Although the statement of claim makes no mention of a Sister Greyeyes, the parties agree that she was one of the employees alleged to have abused the plaintiff at the Residential School.
[6] The plaintiff claims that his damages were caused by the negligence, breach of trust and breach of fiduciary duty of the Attorney General.
The relevant paragraph of the statement of claim reads as follows:19.

(“LAA”), The Public Officers’ Protection Act, R.S.S.
or its predecessor legislation (“POPA”), s. 59 of The Trustee Act, R.S.S.","The claimant brought an action in the Small Claims Court to enforce a default judgment it had been granted against the defendant in Alberta for breach of contract.
The claimant attempted to proceed in Nova Scotia on the basis of reciprocal enforcement under the common law or enforcement of the debt as a contract.
The adjudicator dismissed the action, finding that the Small Claims Court did not have the authority to enforce an order arising from a foreign jurisdiction and that it could not proceed with the claim for breach of the agreement under the contract as there was no evidence that the Alberta action had been withdrawn, struck or transferred out.
The adjudicator also found that the defendant had not attorned to the jurisdiction of the Alberta court.
The claimant appealed.
Appeal dismissed;
although the adjudicator's interpretation of sec. 15 of the Act and his finding that the defendant had not attorned to the jurisdiction of the Alberta court when there was no evidence before him on that issue constituted errors in law, the present claim was beyond the scope of the Small Claims Court Act, given that the adjudicator would first be called upon to settle a dispute regarding the original court's jurisdiction, the locus of the original contract and a factual dispute concerning attornment.","[0, 1, 7, 15, 6, 14, 18, 22, 11, 2, 20, 5]"

Inc. (“Sweeprite”).
The applications are brought pursuant to ss.
63 and 66 of The Personal Property Security Act, 1993, S.S. 1993, c. P-6.2 (the “PPSA”).
[2] Counsel for the parties have cooperated in having this motion heard and decided by filing an Agreed Statement of Facts (“Agreed Statement”) with attached exhibits.
A photocopy of the Agreed Statement (without exhibits) is attached as Schedule “A” to this judgment.
The whole of the Agreed Statement with exhibits is incorporated by reference into this judgment.
BACKGROUND FACTS AND CIRCUMSTANCES[3] Sweeprite was incorporated by Leslie Hulickso in January of 1985 and it commenced business as an equipment manufacturing company specializing in the manufacture of commercial street and parking lot sweepers.
Patchrite was also incorporated by Mr. Hulickso, in May of 1990, for the purpose of manufacturing and marketing pothole patching machines.
It never commenced that business.
[4] A third company involved in these circumstances is Gateway Capital Corp. (“Gateway”) incorporated as a capital pool company.
[5] In 2000 Mr. Hulickso began negotiating the sale of Sweeprite to Gateway.
Its land, building and equipment assets were not included in the sale.","The accused was convicted by a jury of sexual assault and assault with a weapon.
He was sentenced to 2 years in a federal penitentiary plus 2 years probation.
He appeals both conviction and sentence.
The accused and complainant met in a bar for the first time and then went to the accused's apartment.
The complainant is a sex trade worker and was of the view that the accused was prepared to pay for sex.
The accused stated that he did not know the complainant was a prostitute and thought she had 'picked him up'.
Upon arriving at the appellant's home, he refused to pay for sex and the complainant refused consensual sex, at which point the appellant forced himself upon her, forcibly restrained her, removed her clothing and touched her body in a sexual manner, choked her and struck her in the face.
As she tried to escape, the appellant struck her three times in the back with a baseball bat.
The appellant argues there were two problems with the jury charge: 1) that the trial judge should have addressed the jury further with respect to the various types of inconsistencies and contradictions in the complainant's testimony and explained their significance, and 2) the trial judge should have mentioned a number of additional inconsistencies.
HELD: Appeal against conviction dismissed.
The issues with the jury charge do not give rise to intervention by this Court.
While there is a general obligation on the trial judge to instruct the jury by reviewing the evidence and addressing inconsistencies, how the obligation is fulfilled will vary from case to case.
There is no absolute formula automatically giving rise to a new trial.
Much depends on the context of the whole trial and such things as the nature of the inconsistency and whether it goes to the essence of an element of the offence.
The trial judge's charge was entirely correct in the circumstances of this case.
Appeal against sentence is allowed and a sentence of 2 years less 1 day is substituted.
The sentence imposed by the trial judge was based on a consensus between the crown and defence counsels.
Both were of the view that a sentence in the federal system was more appropriate since it would permit the appellant to access sex offender treatment.
After sentencing, the appellant, who is an immigrant, was informed that with a sentence of 2 years, he would have no appeal against an order declaring him inadmissible to Canada.
If a sentence of less than 2 years is imposed, he will be guaranteed the opportunity to appear personally or by counsel on his appeal of such an order.
The jurisprudence supports the proposition that a sentence's unintended effect on immigration status can be a relevant factor on sentence appeal.","[1, 4, 3, 5, 0, 7, 8, 6, 11, 13, 9, 12, 10, 15]"

Section 181 of the Bankruptcy and Insolvency Act reads as follows:""(1) Where, in the opinion of the court, a receiving order ought not to have been made on an assignment ought not to have been filed, the court may by order annul the bankruptcy.""
The bankrupt`s submission is twofold.
Firstly that the bankrupt received misinformation or had a misunderstanding concerning the effect of an assignment on the status of potential builders` lien claimants and secondly the undervaluation of his assets.
Along with those two grounds the bankrupt also asserts that the bankruptcy proceedings are of no value to him.
I am not going to repeat the facts in detail.
The bankrupt submits that he received wrong legal advice concerning the status of the builders` lien claimants.
In essence, he states he ""thought"" he was advised that the various subcontractors would not be able to pursue claims against the home he was constructing or against himself.
Of course, as it turns out the builders` lien claimants have status akin to secured creditors and can pursue the bankrupt personally for any deficiency that may arise if the home is sold and the proceeds divided among the claimants.","Applicant seeks an order for an assessment of his legal bill.
A Registrar may assess any bill for legal services, provided that the application is filed within 30 days or more if a judge makes a discretionary order to extend the period for assessment if it is in the interests of justice to do so.
The issue if whether the applicant's two bills fall with the said 30 days or if this is a case where it is appropriate to abridge the time for allowing an assessment.
HELD: It is in the interest of justice to order an assessment.
The bills were issued in two separate matters.
In the first matter, the final bill was rendered and the applicant had a lengthy opportunity to raise the issue.
There will be no extension of time for the first bill.
The second bill is different in that the applicant disputed the amount of the bill when he first received it.
He was advised that the bill would be adjusted.
An initial adjustment was made and when still not satisfied, ongoing discussions about the bill continued.
The Court held that the last document received by the applicant was not the final bill as it was still subject to change.
In this case, the lawyer has been paid from monies held in trust for the client, the time being abridged is relatively short and neither party has alleged that any prejudice would result.","[0, 1, 5, 2, 6, 7, 9, 8, 4, 10, 11]"

February 8, 2010 Registrar in Bank­ruptcy [1] Robert Alan Burroughs (“Burroughs”) applies for his discharge from bankruptcy through his trustee.
Discharge is opposed by the Synergy Credit Union (“SCU”) and by the trustee.
His Statement of Affairs shows assets of $171,255 (mostly exempt or encumbered) against unsecured debts totalling $433,750, and secured debt of $150,000.
Burroughs is a first time bankrupt.
[2] Burroughs assigned into bankruptcy on January 25, 2008.
His discharge application came before me initially on November 14, 2008 at which time SCU exercised its right to cross-examine Burroughs.
That examination was marred by acrimony but served to highlight informational gaps in the bankrupt’s disclosure as well as raising questions about surplus income obligations.
His application was then adjourned sine die and a fiat issued requiring further disclosure.
The matter came back before me on October 16, 2009 and Burroughs was again cross-examined by SCU.
The pertinent facts are these.
Burroughs was a cattle farmer.
He financed this undertaking principally through the Lloydminster Credit Union (now SCU) having taken out numerous loans over the years.
His financial problems worsened in 2002.
SCU supported his plan.
Instead of selling cattle, Burroughs did the opposite.","The accused was arrested for possession of drugs and a weapon, and for breaching his probation.
Police testified they saw him walking down the street at 10am and noticed a strong smell of marijuana.
When approached, he was smoking a cigarette in front of the provincial courthouse.
He said he had smoked marijuana on the street, but did not have any other drugs on him.
After they spoke, he asked to leave, saying he was late for a court appointment.
The police asked him to deal with this matter first, ran a CPIC check and discovered the accused was on probation and required to keep the peace and be of good behaviour.
He was not cautioned/advised of his right to counsel until he was arrested on the basis of what the Crown claimed was a reasonable belief the accused possessed drugs.
Police conducted a 'pat-down' search, and found drugs (marijuana and cocaine) and a weapon.
The accused argued his Charter rights were violated (s. 8, 9 and 10(b)) and asked the court to exclude the evidence obtained in the search.
He also argued his admission/statement was not voluntary and should be excluded on the basis that it was given in the context of a violation of his Charter rights.
Motions to exclude the statement and evidence obtained in the search denied.
The accused's s. 8 and 9 rights were not breached.
While his s. 10(b) rights were violated when he asked to leave and the officers asked him to deal with this first (which amounted to detention), his admission/statement was made before the detention and was voluntary.
Further, no evidence was obtained as a result of the breach since the search only took place after the arrest/cautioning.
After reviewing the relevant jurisprudence, the court concluded: the Crown must prove the arresting officer subjectively believed they found an offence apparently being committed; that subjective belief must be objectively reasonable; police may rely on an inference in forming their belief (such as the inference that marijuana smokers typically carry a supply with them); and that inference must be objectively reasonable in light of the circumstances and facts of the case.
Here, the officer's subjective belief that the accused was in possession of drugs was objectively reasonable.
The court accepted her evidence that she had special training in identifying the smell of marijuana and distinguishing between a strong and faint smell of marijuana.
The CPIC check showed he was on probation in relation to a drug charge.
Since the officer had the authority to arrest under s. 495(1)(b) of the Criminal Code, the arrest was lawful.
The search taking place incidental to the arrest was reasonable.
In obiter, the court went on to say that, even if the accused's s. 8 and 9 Charter rights had been breached, an analysis under s. 24 would lead to a decision not to exclude the evidence: it was not conscriptive; the offence was serious; there was no bad faith on the part of police; and the accused could have lawfully been arrested for admitting to what was a breach of his probation.","[0, 1, 5, 7, 8, 6, 2, 4, 10, 11, 12, 14, 9, 15, 20, 18, 21, 16]"

HERAUF, July 22, 1999 Registrar in Bankruptcy This discharge application involves another bankrupt who is self employed and through indifference, disregard and neglect does not pay his taxes.
This is the second bankruptcy for this bankrupt.
The sole unsecured creditor is Revenue Canada with a proved claim of just under $89,000.00 for unpaid income tax and unremitted G.S.T.
It should come as no surprise that Revenue Canada was also the major creditor in the first bankruptcy.
The bankrupt has a horrendous record for non-payment of his tax obligations which stretches back at least 15 years.
Not only does the bankrupt not pay his taxes he also does not file his returns.
The bankrupt is 43 years of age, in good health and has no dependants.
He is a self-employed contractor and has an enviable income.
In fact, the only issue at the discharge hearing was the determination of the amount of surplus income available to pay toward a conditional order.","The defendant was found guilty of attempted murder after he used a handgun to shoot the complainant outside a bar.

Prior to the mason beginning work for the day and the supervisor temporarily leaving the site, he had told another employee to install a 'mid' guardrail but no such rail was in place when the mason fell.
The court found that having decided to use guardrails, the defendant was required to make certain that those guardrails were, in fact, constructed in the manner prescribed in the regulations and to supervise and inspect the scaffolding before work was undertaken, no matter the experience level of his crew.
In regard to the first count, what the supervisor thought might be a substitute for part of a proper guardrail system did not comply with the regulations.
The defendant will donate $2,000 to the Public Education Trust Fund and make 18 presentations at various venues over the next 18 months; he will appear in court on a specified date to provide a status report on his progress in this regard.
This was not a case of reckless disregard or deliberate indifference to the legislated safety measures and the defendant's degree of moral blameworthiness was at the lower end of the continuum as he neither created nor negligently left in place a hidden hazard.

Although he had no criminal record and had been on a recognizance for 16 months prior to sentencing, the Crown argued that he was a flight risk given that his convictions would result in a mandatory three-year prison term and he had only a tenuous connection to the jurisdiction.
Application for bail pending appeal granted provided the defendant enter into a recognizance of $25,000 with conditions.
The defendant's actions bore no resemblance to the known problem of indiscriminate firearm use locally as he was a middle-aged professional and gun hobbyist and the circumstances that purportedly made him a flight risk had nothing to do with these charges but rather with his professional obligations.","[2, 9, 4, 5, 17, 7, 20, 21, 10, 12, 14, 16, 18, 0, 24, 3, 23, 8]"

Equipment Ltd.JUDGMENT ZARZECZNY J.February 27, 2003[1] W.R.T.
Equipment Ltd. (“W.R.T.” or the “Company”) applies for an order granting court approval of a proposal made by it to its creditor (the “W.R.T.
Proposal” or “Proposal”) pursuant to Part III of Division I of the Bankruptcy and Insolvency Act, R.S.C.
1985, c. B-3 (the “BIA”).
[2] Section 59 of the BIA governs applications for approval of an insolvent person’s Proposal under the BIA and it provides as follows:59.
Since filing the Proposal with the Official Receiver for the Saskatoon Bankruptcy District on November 12, 2002, two meetings of the creditors were held on December 3, 2002 and December 17, 2002.
At the December 3 meeting approximately 93 percent of W.R.T.’s creditors who had proven claims voted in favour of accepting the Proposal.","The defendant entered into a plea agreement to a charge of sexually assaulting his young son but, shortly before the sentencing hearing, he applied to withdraw his guilty plea on the basis that he had not been fully informed of the nature of the allegations, partly due to a communication issue (English was not his first language) and partly because he had not viewed the video of his son's statement to the police prior to the plea.
He did not accept the Crown's version of the incident and had not fully understood the effect and consequences of his plea, especially its effect on his ability to have contact with his son.
The defendant argued that he thought the charge was based upon an incident where he had touched his son's penis for the purpose of showing him how to clean it as opposed to the Crown's assertion that he had masturbated his son and himself while viewing pornography.
Application to withdraw guilty plea dismissed;
the defendant's evidence regarding his knowledge of the facts alleged by the Crown in relation to the sexual assault was inconsistent and the court was not convinced that either his failure to see the video of his son's statement or a language/communication issue had prevented him from having a full understanding of the specific allegation of the sexual assault.
The defendant's motivation for pleading guilty did not alter his knowledge and understanding of the nature of the allegation nor his understanding that he was, by his plea, admitting to that allegation.","[0, 1, 2, 4, 3, 5, 9, 7, 11, 10, 8, 16, 15]"

May 23, 1997 Paterson & Sons appeals an arbitration award respecting a contract dispute between it and A & B Rail Contractors.
A term of the contract provides that either party can refer any dispute respecting their contractual obligations to arbitration.
A dispute arose between the parties respecting the performance of the contract and both parties agreed to a resolution of the dispute by arbitration.
They each retained legal counsel, agreed on an arbitrator, and defined the issues to be resolved.
The arbitrator heard two days of viva voce evidence, admitted several documents as exhibits, received written legal briefs from counsel, and subsequently rendered a written decision that dealt with all the issues before him.
The Arbitration ProcessA court judgment is often the only means by which the parties to a contract can resolve a dispute respecting its performance.
The only condition of its availability to the parties is that they agree to submit to it.
Section 38 provides that an award binds the parties unless it is varied or set aside pursuant to s. 45 or 46.
Section 18(2) provides that an arbitrator can determine questions of law.
Section 22(1) provides that an arbitrator is not bound by the rules of evidence and has the power to determine the admissibility, relevance and weight of any evidence.","A co-executor and beneficiary under his mother's will, Mr. Hand applied for an order confirming her gift of a one-half interest in a condo held jointly by his parents until her death.
His sister and his father, Dr. Hand, successfully defeated the motion, with the court holding the gift was invalid and the condo passed solely to Dr. Hand on Mrs. Hand's death.
Dr. Hand abandoned his motion for costs, but Mr. Hand sought to have his solicitor-client costs paid out of the estate.
In the alternative, he sought party and party costs against his father and sister.
The parties will bear their own costs.
There is no need to depart from the general rule that the successful party is entitled to costs.
Here, this would be Dr. Hand but since he is not seeking costs, none will be awarded.
As for the proposition that it's appropriate to have the estate pay costs related to estate litigation, it doesn't apply here.
The will's meaning was not unclear, the gift was just invalid.
The central issue was between Mr. Hand and his father: was Dr. Hand required to stand by his previous gift, and were the wills made by he and his wife mutual wills subject to a promise against revocation?
In this sense, this was not estate litigation, but rather a dispute between two living persons about the contractual obligations of one of them.","[1, 0, 2, 6, 7, 11, 15, 8, 14, 13, 9, 4, 16]"

On the hearing of this appeal, the parties were agreed that Mrs. Collins is no longer residing in the trailer court.
In light of this, the nature of the custody order and its adjuncts such as the order not to remove the children from the jurisdiction have become unclear.

The plaintiff asserts that the defendant breached the contract by failing to properly monitor the temperature in the freezer.
HELD: The contract between the parties was solely for installation and monitoring.
The contract did not include any obligation on the defendant to maintain or repair the equipment at the plaintiff's business.
The Court was satisfied that the defendant was monitoring the signal from the plaintiff's business on the dates in question and no alarm was received.

for the respondentJUDGMENT ACTON J. April 23, 2013 [1] This is an appeal from the decision of the Provincial Court dismissing an application for a recognizance pursuant to s. 810.2 of the Criminal Code, R.S.C.
1985, c. C-46.
The issue is whether the usual rules of evidence pertaining to criminal trials apply to a s. 810 hearing.
[2] The judge also held that records kept by the Correctional Service of Canada (CSC) were inadmissible as business records under s. 30 of the Canada Evidence Act, R.S.C.
1985, c. C-5.
In reaching this decision the judge relied upon R. v. Fontaine, 2010 SKPC 16 (CanLII), 356 Sask.R.
229, which held that hearsay evidence is not admissible in a s. 810.2 hearing.
The judge also relied on R. v. Toulejour, 2012 SKPC 86 (CanLII), 398 Sask.R.
[3] The appellant submits that these are errors in law in that the usual criminal rules of evidence do not apply in s. 810 hearings.
SUMMARY OF THE FACTS[4] On March 5, 2009, the respondent was convicted of robbery with violence, assault causing bodily harm, assault and three counts of violating bail.","The accused was charged with one count of impaired driving and one count of operating a motor vehicle while his blood alcohol content exceeded .08, contrary to ss. 253(1)(a) and 253(1)(b) of the Criminal Code.
After trial, the accused was found not guilty on both charges.
The Crown appealed on the basis that the trial judge erred in law in finding that the accused's rights were violated pursuant to s. 10(b) of the Charter and by excluding the evidence pursuant to s. 24(2) of the Charter.
The accused was stopped by RCMP at 2:47 am to check his licence, registration, and sobriety.
There were no driving irregularities leading to the stop.
The officer noted a slight smell of alcohol and the accused blew a 'fail' on the roadside screening device.
The accused indicated at roadside that he would like to contact a lawyer.
At the detachment, the accused was asked which lawyer he wanted to contact and the accused gave a name to which the officer misunderstood.
A search for the misunderstood name by the officer did not result in any findings.
A search for a second name given by the accused resulted in 60 persons and the officer did not pursue any of them.
The officer suggested legal aid but the accused refused.
The accused was never provided a phone or a phonebook.
The accused subsequently indicated that he understood the waiver regarding legal counsel and that he did not want to contact one.
The accused did not recall this waiver.
The accused indicated that he provided breath samples right away because he thought the officer was in a hurry and he understood that if he did not provide breath samples he was automatically guilty.
The accused's readings were .11 and .04.
The trial judge held that the accused was not given a reasonable opportunity to exercise his right to counsel of his choice and that the appropriate remedy was to exclude the breath sample results.
HELD: The appeal was not successful.
Whether there has been a Charter breach and whether evidence should thus be excluded are both questions of law reviewable on a standard of correctness.
There is both an informational component and an implementational component to s. 10(b).
The implementational component was the one of concern because the accused was not provided with the opportunity to consult counsel of his choice.
The appeal court had to determine who was responsible for that failure.
The failure was that of the officer first in misunderstanding the lawyer's name, then in not asking the accused the name again, and then in abandoning the search of the second lawyer when too many names were returned.
The waiver did not remedy the situation because the accused did not fully understand it and it was therefore not effective.
The trial judge did not err in finding that the accused`s s. 10(b) rights were breached.
The trial judge correctly applied the test for s. 24(2) and the finding that the admission of the breath samples would bring the administration of justice into disrepute was not set aside.","[1, 4, 5, 13, 8, 0, 9, 10, 7, 11, 15, 3]"

February 3, 2011 [1] The Crown is appealing the acquittal of the accused on a charge of carrying a concealed weapon contrary to s. 90 of the Criminal Code R.S.C.
1985, c. C-46.
The Crown appeals on the grounds that the learned trial judge misapprehended the evidence, ignored other evidence and improperly admitted opinion evidence.
The Crown submits that the verdict was unreasonable and not supported by the evidence and seeks a conviction on the charge.
Background:[2] The Crown’s case consisted of an Agreed Statement of Facts (Exhibit P-1) and the admission of the item seized from the accused on July 18, 2009, a sword in a black plastic sheath (Exhibit P-2).
[3] On the morning of July 18, 1009, the accused and Dr. Nick Perry were at the Sarcan Recycling Centre at 1601 Angus Street in Regina.
Dr. Perry was standing behind the accused.
He believed the accused was acting suspiciously.
At one point, the accused pulled up his shirt to scratch his side, exposing a sword type weapon tucked into the back of his waist band.
One of the officers asked the accused to stop and place his hands on his head.
The accused did not comply.
This time, the accused complied as instructed.","Civil Procedure – Appeal – Leave to AppealLand – Certificate of Pending Litigation
The appellant sought leave to appeal the chambers decision not to vacate the certificate of pending litigation registered on behalf of her estranged husband, who was deceased.
The respondent’s solicitors filed the certificate of pending litigation after his death.
The appellant transferred the land subject to the certificate of pending litigation into her name only and entered into an agreement to sell the land, which could not proceed with the certificate of pending litigation.
HELD: The appeal was of sufficient merit and it was not prima facie frivolous or vexatious.
The appeal, however, was not found to be of sufficient importance to the practice of law or the Court of Queen’s Bench to warrant determination by the Court of Appeal.
There was no new, controversial or unusual issue of practice raised by the appeal.

[1] This summary conviction appeal by the Crown was brought when the trial judge dismissed charges of impaired driving and driving with a blood alcohol level exceeding .08 percent.
The trial judge held that the circumstances supported a special plea of “autrefois acquit” and that the manner of proceeding by the Crown was an abuse of process at common law.
FACTS[2] No hearing was conducted, but the facts were agreed to by counsel.
On December 29, 2000, the respondent was driving on highway number 17 in Lloydminster.
Police from the Kitscoty detachment of the R.C.M.P.
investigated and charged the respondent with the drinking and driving offences.
He was issued an Appearance Notice (Recognizance) requiring his attendance in Lloydminster, Alberta, Provincial Court on February 6, 2001.
An information charging the two offences was sworn on January 19, 2001, but was not available in the Alberta court when the respondent appeared.
[3] On February 8, 2001, an Alberta prosecutor wrote to the R.C.M.P.
in Lloydminster, Saskatchewan, suggesting that the same two charges against the respondent be “re-laid” in Saskatchewan.
An information was sworn in Saskatchewan on March 1, 2001, and brought before the Provincial Court in Lloydminster, Saskatchewan, on March 5, 2001.","Constitutional Law – Charter of Rights, Section 8Criminal Law – Sexual Touching – Child VictimThe accused was charged that she did, with a sexual purpose, invite a person under the age of 16 years to touch a part of her body contrary to s. 152 of the Criminal Code.
The case involved alleged improper acts by the accused with respect to her eight-year-old son.
The information regarding the alleged incident had been given by the accused’s son to her husband.
The parties were separated.
The husband apparently involved a child protection worker, who interviewed the child.
After this RCMP were contacted.
On the basis of an RCMP’s affidavit, an ITO was prepared and a search warrant obtained.
During the search, the accused’s cell phone was seized and photographs were found on it.
They showed the accused lying naked on a bed with her breasts and vaginal area covered and showing her son in his pajamas, holding a bottle of lotion and touching her legs, feet and stomach.
Before trial, defence counsel requested that a voir dire be held for the purpose of determining whether the information to obtain the search warrant (ITO) was sufficiently defective that the warrant was invalid, thereby infringing s. 8 of the Charter and that the evidence obtained should be excluded.
The ITO did not allege that the commission of sexual assault or the creation of child pornography.
The search warrant though authorized a search for images of explicit sexual activity with a person under the age of 18, with emphasis on sexual organs and the anal region, which were not related to the offence alleged to have been committed and was not supported by the ITO.
The warrant authorized the search and search of devices that included cameras capable of storing images or data and computers or any other electronic devices as well as conventional photographs depicting sexual activity as described above.
However, the warrant to search specifically stated that the police were authorized to search for the said “things and to bring them before or some other justice”.
When the search warrant was executed, about three constables and a social worker went to the accused’s home.
She was in her bedroom and was very upset when advised that there would be a search of her house.
She was arrested for obstruction when she objected to the police looking at a computer, taken into custody and removed from the house to a police vehicle.
During the ensuing search, one officer looked through a computer, searching for pictures.
He testified that he had done so as “previewing for relevancy” and had in fact, found relevant photographs.
Another constable, who had not reviewed the warrant, searched the accused’s purse and found a cell phone, which was an item not included in the warrant.
Other issues raised by the defence included that the information contained in the affidavit had not met the test of establishing that an offence had been committed and that misleading information had been included.
The affidavit had identified that the search was for explicit sexual pictures that did not correspond to the information obtained from the child, who was the only source of information of the alleged offence.
The information in the ITO came from a number of different sources, including the original complaint by the accused’s husband who was engaged in a matrimonial dispute with her.
The husband had made a number of complaints against his wife in the past, none of which resulted in a conviction.
The officer who swore the affidavit had not differentiated between information obtained by him and information from third party sources.
The officer also set out information, including photographs, he had obtained from an Internet search that pertained to the accused as a lingerie model.
The purpose of including the information was not made clear.
The officer did not disclose in the ITO the detailed nature of the information disclosed by the child to the child protection worker, which would have had the potential to detract from the likelihood of an offence having been committed, such as the accused asking her son to massage her because she was sore.
The child stated that he did not believe that he had been sexually abused.
Furthermore, the child identified the photographer, but the police had not interviewed him.
The issues before the Court were: 1) if the Warrant to Search was valid in view of the issues raised with respect to the completeness and validity of the ITO; 2) if the search of the computer conducted on the premises was legal, either because of the rules established in R. v. Vu or because of the wording of the warrant itself; and 3) if there was a breach or breaches of the Charter, should the evidence be excluded?
 HELD: The Court found with respect to the issues that: 1) the ITO could not support the issue of the warrant by a justice acting judicially in considering the effect of the statements in the ITO regarding modelling and the omission of the information in the child protection worker’s report, that the husband of the accused had previously made allegations against her, the misleading statement in the ITO concerning the specific types of pictures that the officers would search for, suggesting an investigation of more serious activity not supported by the information provided.
The Warrant to Search was a nullity and the search unlawful; 2) the search of the computer on the premises was illegal both in terms of its violation of the terms of the warrant and because the Supreme Court decided in Vu that a warrant must expressly grant the authority to search a computer; and 3) the evidence from the illegal search of the computer was excluded.
The breach of the accused’s s. 8 Charter right was serious because of the negligence shown by the police in their investigation of the complaint, the drafting of the ITO and the execution of the warrant.
The impact of the breach on the accused was serious.
Her entire home was unlawfully searched as well.
The effect of the search was emotional and upsetting to the accused and resulted in her arrest.
The interests of society in the administration of justice will be protected because the exclusion of the evidence would not be determinative of the Crown’s case.","[0, 1, 6, 2, 4, 5, 7, 10, 14, 12, 9, 15, 11, 16]"

In the circumstances, the appeal against the acquittal on the charge of impaired driving is dismissed and this appeal will proceed on the basis that the Crown seeks to overturn the acquittal on the charge of driving while over .08.
THE FACTS[4] At the trial the Crown called two witnesses, namely, the arresting officer, Cst.
Erin Lockyer, and the breathalyzer technician, Sgt.
Ian Skinner.
Defence counsel had given verbal notice of a Charter issue at a prior appearance but elected not to seek a voir dire or to call any evidence in support of the Charter application.
The Crown closed its case and the defendant elected not to call any witnesses.
In his written decision (cited as 2009 SKPC 66 (CanLII), 341 Sask.R.

The officer made no observations of improper driving at that time.
10 Upon seeing the pickup truck driven by the accused initiate a U-turn, Cst.
Additionally, the U-turn was unlawful.
12 But for the U-turn itself, the officer made no notice of any abnormal driving.
The accused was cooperative and gave up the keys.","Criminal Law – Motor Vehicle Offences – Driving with Blood Alcohol Exceeding .08 – Conviction – AppealConstitutional Law – Charter of Rights, Section 10(b) – Appeal
The accused appealed her conviction under s. 253(1)(b) of the Criminal Code of driving with a blood alcohol content over .08 on the grounds that the trial judge erred in law finding that there was no breach of her s. 8 Charter rights or of a breach of her s. 10(b) Charter rights.
The first ground pertained to the defence’s contention that the officer who stopped the accused and made the breath demand did not have sufficient evidence of impaired driving.
The officer testified that he was patrolling for impaired drivers on the night in question and observed the accused make a very tight right-hand turn, entering the untraveled portion of the road where the snow was soft.
He noticed that her eyes were glassy and she was slurring her speech.
She had just lit a cigarette, which suspects often do to mask the smell of alcohol.
When she did put the cigarette out, he smelled alcohol on her breath.
He asked her to step out of the vehicle and noticed that she swayed while standing still.
She walked with a wide stance to the police cruiser and had to lean against it to maintain her balance.
When he first asked the appellant if she had had anything to drink, she said that she’d had three but later said that she’d had five.
He arrested her and made the breath demand.
The defence argued that the trial judge erred in failing to consider other evidence that other vehicles had made similar turns and that the appellant did not require any assistance in leaving her vehicle and walking to the police cruiser, among other things.
With respect to the second ground, the appellant advised the officer that she wanted to speak to a specific lawyer after being arrested.
At the detachment, the appellant located the lawyer’s number and the officer dialed it.
A voice message was left on the lawyer’s telephone but no return call was received.
The officer advised the appellant she could call another lawyer, and initially she responded that she did not want to but wished to provide a breath sample.
The officer was about to read her a waiver of her right when the appellant indicated that she wanted to call another lawyer.
The officer called the number but received an after-hours message.
He asked the appellant if she wanted to try another lawyer and she declined, stating that she was satisfied with leaving a message.
She then provided her first breath sample.
The defence argued at trial that the officer failed to advise the appellant of the availability of Legal Aid and failed to provide the Prosper warning, thereby breaching s. 10(b) of the Charter.
 HELD: The appeal was dismissed.
The court found that the trial judge had not erred: 1) by finding there was no s. 8 breach.
The judge had not made any findings of fact that were not supported by the evidence nor did he fail to consider relevant evidence when he found that the officer had sufficient evidence that objectively supported his belief that the appellant’s ability to drive was impaired;
and 2) by finding that there had been no breach of s. 10(b).
The appellant had failed to act diligently in pursuing her right to speak with a lawyer and provided a clear and unequivocal indication that she had abandoned her right to counsel when she said she was happy leaving a message.","[12, 11, 6, 19, 10, 8, 16, 7, 14, 1, 30, 9, 5, 21]"

[3] The appeal is therefore allowed and the following order is made: That a restitution order pursuant to section 738 in the amount of $8,518 be paid directly to Mr. Hal Schmidt, c/o Family Pizza, Bay #10, 318 - 105th Street, Saskatoon, Saskatchewan, S7N 1Z3.
That the six month conditional sentence is affirmed with the conditions as originally ordered with an additional condition:He shall pay restitution to Mr. Hal Schmidt, c/o Family Pizza, Bay #10, 318 - 105th Street, Saskatoon, Saskatchewan, S7N 1Z3 at the rate of at least $200 per month commencing June 1, 1997.","Family Law – Custody and Access – VariationFamily Law – Custody and Access – Voices of the Children Report
In 2012, after a trial, it was determined that the child should be parented on a shared basis with a one-week rotation between parents.
An order was never issued and therefore, no judgment was taken out.
The applicant now applied to have a formal judgment issued, and to vary the decision in favour of her having primary residence.
Alternatively, she sought a Voices of the Child report.
The applicant indicated that the child expressed a desire to live with her full-time.
The parties’ affidavits conflicted as to their behaviour.
The applicant indicated that the child told her he was required to continue skiing with the respondent even though he was having a seizure.
She also indicated that the child told her that the respondent told his roommate he was going to stab the applicant and he called her crazy.
HELD: The court found it appropriate to order a Voices of the Child report.
It was determined that the variation application decision was dependent on the report.
There were more issues at play than a bald statement by the applicant that the child requested to live with her full-time.
The child was an appropriate age for the report, being over 12 years old.
He was able to communicate effectively and the report would be meaningful to the court.
The order was to be paid for through resources provided to the program.
The parties were prohibited from discussing the report process with the child and they were ordered not to influence, coach, sway, or prompt the child towards particular views or statements for the purposes of the report.
The application was adjourned sine die returnable not sooner than 14 days after the report was received by all parties.
The judgment was directed to be issued.","[0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5]"
326,"[1] This is an appeal by the Crown from an order of a Provincial Court Judge declaring that the respondent is unfit to stand trial.
The Crown submits that the trial judge misapprehended the evidence, misstated the evidence, applied the wrong legal test for fitness, applied the wrong burden of proof and made a finding that was unreasonable and not supported by the evidence.
Background[2] The respondent was charged with a total of 29 offences committed between March 25, 2006 and August 26, 2007.
That appeal has not yet been heard.
[3] In addition, the respondent was charged with two indictable offences: two thefts of property of a value not exceeding $5,000 arising out of two separate incidents in March and September, 2006.
The appeal to this Court relates to the finding that the respondent is unfit to stand trial in relation to these offences.
[4] The respondent is 22 years old.
He has been diagnosed as mildly mentally retarded.
[6] He was charged with some property offences in 2002 and, at that time, was found unfit to stand trial.
[7] The parties filed an agreed statement of facts which summarized the facts of all the offences.
It does, however, represent the information before the Court in relation to the relevant allegations.","Contract Law – Sale of Land – FormationReal Property – Sale of Land – Oral Contract
The plaintiff brought an action against the defendant for specific performance and damages.
The plaintiff claimed that the defendant agreed to sell him three quarters of land.
The defendant’s position was that there was no agreement and if there was, it was not in writing as required by The Statute of Frauds.
The plaintiff made this application for a resolution of the initial question of liability as to whether an agreement was created and if it was, then proof of damages would follow.
The plaintiff argued that a contract was created and that it complied with the statute because he made his offer in writing, via an internet-based land auction program, and the acceptance was orally communicated by a telephone conversation.
Therefore, all the requisite elements of a valid land sale were present.
The defendant had used a website to list 17 quarters of land for sale, including six quarters of relevance to the action.
The website was intended to connect sellers of farmland with interested buyers in a type of “non-binding auction” to permit sellers to gauge interest in their land, find the best possible price and avoid realtor’s commissions if a sale were completed.
The listing showed three groups of the farmland for sale, described as 1) three adjoining quarters (the subject quarters); 2) two quarters (the adjacent quarters) and 3) one quarter (unsold quarter).
In his online comments to the defendant during the auction, the plaintiff said that he wanted all five quarters (the subject and adjacent quarters).
The plaintiff bid on each of the above parcels and had the highest bid on the subject quarters, but that in itself did not guarantee the purchase under the terms of the online auction program.
He stopped bidding on the adjacent quarters because he thought they were becoming overpriced.
After the auction, the plaintiff consulted with family members regarding whether to pursue negotiations with any of the bidders.
They discussed the problems that would occur if the subject quarters were separated from the adjacent quarters because the two blocks were owned by different individuals.
The defendant then telephoned the plaintiff and gave him two package options for the sale, both of which resolved the identified problem by including the purchase of the adjacent quarters.
The package options were to purchase the subject and the adjacent quarters for $1,050,000 (which was 5 percent more than the $625,000 the plaintiff offered for the subject quarters and his last bid of $375,000 on the adjacent quarters) or the subject quarters and one of the adjacent quarters for $840,000.
At the end of the conversation, the plaintiff testified that he wanted to be sure that regardless of his response to the package option offers, he would be able to buy the subject quarters for $625,000.
The plaintiff did not have concerns about the purchase because he said that the defendant told him that “we had them”.
He believed that this indicated the defendant’s willingness to accept his bid on the subject quarters and that if he accepted either of the two options, then either of the newly accepted offers would replace the agreement respecting the subject quarters.
The defendant’s interpretation of the conversation was that he declined to accept the offer on the subject quarters until he heard back from the plaintiff respecting the package options and then he would decide whether or not he would sell the subject quarters.
He either misheard or misunderstood the plaintiff’s question about the subject quarters and denied that he gave any assurance that he would sell them to him regardless of his response to the package offers.
The plaintiff called the defendant shortly after the first conversation and advised that he would not accept either of the package option offers but would immediately bring the deposit for the purchase of the subject quarters.
The defendant told him to “hold off”.
The plaintiff interpreted that to mean that there was no urgency regarding the deposit rather than that no agreement existed respecting the subject quarters.
The defendant testified that he said he was not prepared to accept the deposit at this time, which meant that he was not prepared to accept the plaintiff’s bid on the subject quarters.
Three days later, the defendant emailed the plaintiff and said that he would not be accepting the bid.
The issues were: 1) whether a contract was formed; 2) if so, did the Statute of Frauds apply.
 HELD: The plaintiff’s action was dismissed.
He had not established on a balance of probabilities that he and the defendant were parties to a valid and enforceable agreement of sale regarding the subject quarters.
The court found with respect to each issue that: 1) there was no contract.
In interpreting the words of the first telephone conversation and the context of the bidding process, using the standard of the reasonable bystander, there was no consensus ad idem between the parties.
The second telephone conversation had done nothing to alter that finding.
Both the plaintiff and the defendant reasonably believed different things;
and 2) the Statute did not apply as there was no contract.","[4, 2, 11, 10, 8, 3, 23, 21, 13, 9, 26]"

(orally) This is a Crown appeal against two sentences of two years less a day each, to be served concurrently.
The sentences were imposed in respect of two convictions for armed robbery.
The respondent agreed that the facts of the case were accurately set out in the Crown factum as follows: On September 10, 1994 the Respondent negotiated a sale of hash oil to be supplied by the complainant Jesse Thorseth.
The arrangement was for the Respondent to come to Mr. Thorseth's apartment in the evening to pick it up.
The Respondent had only $425.00 of the $450.00 which was the negotiated price but Mr. Thorseth agreed that it was sufficient.","Statutes – Interpretation – Limitation of Civil Rights Act, Section 2The plaintiff bank applied by notice of application for a deficiency judgment against the defendant pertaining to the non-purchase money portion of the outstanding indebtedness to the plaintiff pursuant to her mortgage and to some other costs related to the mortgage.
The original mortgage executed by the plaintiff was for $191,000 of which $176,000 was advanced to purchase her condominium and $15,000, eight per cent of the total, was advanced for other purchases.
The property sold for $156,000 pursuant to a judicial sale.
The sale proceeds were distributed to pay outstanding property taxes, commission, and the principal and interest due under the mortgage in the amount of $141,945 and the net sale proceeds were to be distributed pro rata.
As at November 1, 2017, the principal and interest owing on the non-purchase money portion of the mortgage was $21,250.
The plaintiff requested judgment for the deficiency in the amount of $9,900 with interest to the date of judgment.
It claimed it was entitled to solicitor-client costs and other costs accrued by it under the mortgage.
The issue was whether such costs should be subject to the pro rata calculation for the nonpurchase portion of the mortgage, that is, 8 percent of the total costs incurred.
 HELD: The application was granted.
The court found that the plaintiff was entitled to a deficiency judgment for principal and interest owed under the mortgage in the amount requested.
It was also entitled to judgment against the mortgagee for eight percent of the solicitor-client costs, condominium fees and property management charges.","[1, 2, 4, 5, 0, 7, 3, 6, 8]"

Sentencing was adjourned to March 5, 2007 to allow a pre-sentence report to be prepared.
On March 5, 2007, the Respondent was sentenced to a fine of $200.00 and again placed on probation for a period of one year.
Among other things, the probation terms once again require Mr. Yaremko to partake in anger management programming.
As he concluded the sentencing, and without any discussion or explanation, the sentencing judge waived the victim surcharge.
The surcharge was waived notwithstanding that the Respondent had not requested an exemption pursuant to s. 737(5) of the Criminal Code (the “Code”).
[2] The Crown appeals the sentence to the extent that the victim surcharge was waived.
The appeal is made on the basis that the trial judge did not comply with the mandatory provisions of s. 737 of the Code.
Section 737 states:737.
(1) Subject to subsection (5), an offender who is convicted or discharged under section 730 of an offence under this Act or the Controlled Drugs and Substances Act shall pay a victim surcharge, in addition to any other punishment imposed on the offender.","This was an application under the Charter of Rights and Freedoms for an order declaring that the mandatory retirement of the two appellant university professors was invalid and denied the rights of the appellants as guaranteed under ss. 15(1) and (7) of the Charter, and an order for reinstatement and back pay.
Dismissing the application,
that (1) pursuant to s. 32 of the Charter, the Charter did not apply to these employees since the university was not a subordinate body of government, and was not being controlled by government, but was an independent institution; the fact that the university's governing statute provided that teaching staff were 'deemed to be persons employed in the public service of the Province' for the purposes of their pension plan did not constitute governmental control such as to warrant the application of the Charter; and (2) the proper forum for this application was the Human Rights Commission.
The court also considered the retroactive effect of the Nova Scotia decision in Sniders v. Nova Scotia (Attorney General), which struck down the provision in the Nova Scotia Human Rights Act precluding anyone 65 years or over from making an age discrimination complaint.
The court concluded that the Sniders decision did have a retroactive effect to the date when s. 15 of the Charter came into force.","[1, 2, 4, 3, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 0]"

The applications before the Court are for DNA Warrants to obtain blood samples from the male, the female and the child.
[3] The Informations depose that the Crown has obtained a “DNA sample” from the person who says she is the mother (herein “the natural mother”) of the 19-year-old female.
I assume, although it is not stated in the Informations, that the “DNA sample” is or was derived from a blood sample of the natural mother.
There is no other bodily substance in the possession or control of the Crown which relates to the alleged incest.
That problem is whether the facts as alleged fall within and meet the requirements of s. 487.05(1) of the Code.","This was an application by the plaintiff vendors for a declaration that an objection to title raised by the defendant purchasers was without merit.

On June 1, 1994, the appellant appeared before a judge of the Provincial Court of Saskatchewan.
The Crown elected to proceed against the appellant by way of summary conviction.
The appellant entered a plea of guilty to said charge.
The matter of sentencing was then adjourned to July 7, 1994, and on said latter date was further adjourned to August 4, 1994, pending the receipt of the pre-sentence report directed to be prepared on June 1, 1994.
As well, a ten-year firearm, ammunition and explosive substance prohibition order was made against the appellant pursuant to the provisions of s. 100(1) of the Criminal Code, R.S.C.

He refused, and after completing the trial, awarded custody to the natural mother and her common-law companion.
The decision was appealed.

INTRODUCTION[1] The Crown has applied pursuant to section 753 of the Criminal Code to have Mr.
[F.R.]
designated a dangerous offender.
The Defence position is that he should be designated a long-term offender.
II.
PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND[2] On April 19, 2005 I found [F.R.]
I then ordered the preparation of a pre-sentence report.
[1][3] I was satisfied on the information before me that Mr.
[F.R.]
might be found to be a dangerous or long-term offender and therefore I remanded Mr.
[F.R.]
for the purpose of having Dr. Holden perform the assessment and provide his report to the Court.
Dr. Holden’s report offered the opinion that Mr.
[F.R.]
should be found a dangerous offender.
III.
[2][7] There is a significant difference between the sentence imposed on a dangerous offender as opposed to a long-term offender.
K.R.S.,[5] and J.L.A.G.
v. The Queen.
The sentence reserved for the latter is less restrictive, a matter of significance because in principle the less restrictive sentence is to be imposed whenever reasonably fit.
357.
Their proper discharge requires an appropriate base of fact and opinion.
This is especially so in borderline cases.
[12] In R. v.K.R.S.","The plaintiff sought damages for an alleged breach of a written contract or, in the alternative, damages for unjust enrichment.
The defendants counterclaimed for damages based on alleged negligent misrepresentation by the plaintiff.
The plaintiff had agreed to supply and erect a large sign for the defendant.
The agreement was subject to receiving approval from the Department of Highways for a changeable message centre which was to be part of the sign.
The plaintiff was to apply for the permit, as it was the signage expert.
Although approval was never received, the sign was delivered and installed.
The message centre was never activated, although the equipment was in place at the defendant's warehouse.
Dismissing the claim for breach of contract and allowing the unjust enrichment claim,
that government approval was a condition precedent to the agreement.
Since approval was not forthcoming, the contract was null and void.
The plaintiff's alternative claim for unjust enrichment was allowed against the corporate defendant, based on a reasonable monthly rental.
The defendant's counterclaim was dismissed,
as there was no negligent misrepresentation by the plaintiff.","[4, 8, 5, 14, 16, 9, 22, 21, 15, 25, 13, 39, 2, 1, 40, 46, 20, 63, 6, 3, 17, 11, 57, 62, 44, 29]"

He had an excellent recollection of the events of the night in connection with this case.","The respondents were charged with possession for the purposes of trafficking and cultivation of marijuana, contrary to s. 4(2) and 6(2) of the Narcotic Control Act.
RCMP had investigated a tip that a large crop of marijuana plants was being grown on a private property located in a clearing off a woods road.
They did not have a search warrant to enter the property, and arrested the respondents after observing them care for the plants.
At trial, the court held their right to be secure from unreasonable search and seizure had been violated, and acquitted them.
The Crown appealed the acquittal.
Per Roscoe, J.A., Chipman, J.A. concurring, allowing the appeal and ordering a new trial,
that there was no s. 8 breach because the respondents did not have a reasonable expectation of privacy in the field where the marijuana crop was growing.

[2] In the 1990’s Ms. Little transferred title to the house to the names of herself and the appellant jointly.
The appellant gave no consideration for these transfers and the designation.
He had no access to these assets during the life of Ms. Little.
This appeal is against that judgment.
Did the trial judge err in mixed law and fact in finding that the joint bank and investment accounts were subject to a resulting trust in favour of the residue of the estate?
Did the trial judge erred in law in failing to consider the application and effect of section 57 of The Trustee Act, R.S.S.
1978, c. T-23, which gives courts discretion to relieve trustees of liability, in whole or in part, for technical breaches of trust where a trustee acted honestly, reasonably, and where it is fair to excuse the breach?

PLAINTIFF (RESPONDENT) - and -OCHAPOWACE FIRST NATIONDEFENDANT (APPLICANT)Counsel: Philip J. Gallet for the plaintiff (respondent) Mervin C. Phillips for the defendant (applicant) JUDGMENT ZARZECZNY J. October 27, 2010 THE APPLICATION[1] The defendant, Ochapowace First Nation (“Ochapowace”), applies for the dismissal of the plaintiff’s claim for want of prosecution pursuant to the inherent powers of the court.
The respondent, McDiarmid Lumber Ltd. (“McDiarmid”) responds through its counsel that it now has every intention to diligently proceed with its action.
THE ACTION[2] McDiarmid’s claim in this matter was issued November 1, 1999.
It is a claim based in debt for goods and services provided to Ochapowace in relation to the construction of portable classrooms, 10 housing units and the purchase of mobile homes.
The indebtedness claimed owing is $521,283.89.
Contracts are claimed to exist for the provision of these materials, services and products in 1995 and 1996, some 15 years ago.
[3] Ochapowace’s defence was filed November 12, 1999 and an amended defence June 21, 2002.
The defences basically consist of general denials of liability and challenges to the quality of goods and services provided by McDiarmid.
[4] Mediation was concluded in February of 2000.
Paragraph 5 of the motion setting out the grounds for the order sought states:5.
The person the Plaintiff wishes to discover is Laird Allary.","Allegations by the former wife and a child and family counsellor that the father and his new wife had physically and sexually abused the two children were found by authorities to be baseless.
The co-defendants, the mother and counsellor, protested that they were under a duty to report the disclosures of abuse.
At issue was whether the publication of four reports was libellous thus causing damage to the plaintiffs' reputations, whether they conspired to libel them in order to obtain custody, and whether the counsellor was incompetent and unqualified to assess and counsel the children and negligent in the preparation of the reports.
HELD: Judgment was awarded against the defendants jointly and severally in the amount of $27,000.
Aggravated damages of $1,000 was awarded against the mother and $15,000 was awarded against the counsellor and her company.
 1)To prove that each defendant published written defamatory statements likely to injure their reputations, three presumptions must be made: the statements were published maliciously (malice in law); the statements were false; and the plaintiffs suffered damages. 2)Every publication of a defamatory statement is a new publication.
It is no defence that the mother merely distributed the counsellor's reports.
3)Counsel conceded that the allegations in three of the reports, on their face, were defamatory.
 4)The mother enjoyed qualified privilege prima facie because parental duty is so compelling.
Two reports containing untrue and degrading allegations were in themselves intrinsic evidence of malice.
The long history of the mother's attempts to discredit the plaintiffs was extrinsic evidence of impure motive or malice.
The taping of the phone calls was considered to be just another trick to try and advance her cause.
5)The counsellor's reports tendered in court enjoyed absolute privilege but that privilege was lost when she published them to various social workers, the police and the doctors.
This is true whether the reports were of an ordinary or expert witness. 6)Both criteria, making a report maliciously and without reasonable grounds, must be satisfied before an action will lie pursuant to s.12 of the Child and Family Services Act.
Three reports were slanderous.
7)The conspiracy claim was dismissed.
8)The counsellor had extensive educational background but no clinical training in counselling or interviewing children and 45 sessions were excessive.
9)The counsellor owed a fiduciary duty to the children as their counsellor but owed no corresponding duty to their parents.
The negligence claim was dismissed.
10)The long-lasting mental distress of the plaintiffs was clear and they were entitled to aggravated damages.
They were not awarded punitive damages as there was no need of further deterrence.","[4, 0, 1, 3, 8, 11, 13, 9, 5, 7, 16, 6, 2]"

The defendant has also applied pursuant to Rule 169 for leave to amend his Statement of Defence, by pleading:3A Such words as were spoken or written by the Defendant are true, and the Defendant asserts that the alleged defamation was justified in law.
[2] This is a defamation action, based on statements that the plaintiff alleges were made by the defendant on June 1, 2009.
The College Action is also a defamation action.
It relates to statements made about the competence of the plaintiff as a radiologist which the plaintiff says were published both before and after June 1, 2009.
[3] The defendant says that there are common issues of fact between the two actions.
He submits that trying these actions together would be in the interests of judicial economy, and avoid the possibility of conflicting findings.
[4] The defendant says that the claims are different.","The respondent was hired as an account manager by the appellant.
She did not reach her planned sales goals during her employment, and became depressed.
She took six weeks off work on the advice of her doctor.
When she returned from sick leave she was dismissed by the appellant, who had already decided to terminate her employment after concluding that she was not able to handle the job.
She claimed damages for mental distress for the sudden and callous manner in which she had been dismissed.
The jury awarded the respondent $20,000 in lieu of notice and $60,000 damages for mental distress.
The appellant appealed the award for mental distress.
Per Hallett, J.A., Roscoe, J.A., concurring, allowing the appeal,
that the suddenness and callousness of a dismissal does not constitute conduct that gives rise to an actionable wrong separate and apart from the cause of action for the dismissal without notice.
Per Freeman, J.A., dissenting, dismissing the appeal, that a degree of mental distress is always likely to accompany the termination of employment.
However, when the employer's conduct aggravates the mental distress beyond the degree which can be remedied by agreement or reasonable notice, a right to further damages arises.","[2, 0, 1, 6, 4, 5, 8, 10, 9, 12, 11]"

It will not be necessary to hear from you Mr. Morris.
Having regard for the standard of review applicable to this appeal, we can find no tenable basis for interfering with the order made in the Court of Queen's Bench.
In other words, Mr. Garden, we have not been persuaded that Mr. Justice Kyle either erred in principle in the exercise of the discretionary powers of the Court to dismiss for want of prosecution where there has been inordinate and inexcusable giving rise to prejudice, or overlooked or disregarded a material consideration, or acted unjudicially.
That being so, there is nothing vitiating the exercise by the chamber judge of discretion and no basis for interference by us.
Accordingly, the appeal is dismissed with costs to the respondent, such costs to be taxed in the usual way. '","The applicant sought an order requesting an absolute order of discharge in bankruptcy.
The bankrupt was indebted to Canada Student Loans and Saskatchewan Student Loans.
He had obtained a Bachelor of Science degree but was unable to complete his final year of Veterinary Medicine because he had received the maximum amount of financing available.

He was reluctant to leave secure employment in an effort to obtain employment related to his educational qualifications.

1553 of 2008 Judicial Centre: ReginaBETWEEN:GEORGE ROBERT LAWSON PLAINTIFF - and -VINCENT THOMAS McKAYDEFENDANTAppearing: William J. Herle for the plaintiff Vincent Thomas McKay appearing on his own behalf JUDGMENT WILSON J. December 17, 2010 [1] The defendant, Vincent McKay, contracted with the plaintiff, George Lawson, for the supply and installation of eavestroughing, soffit and facia together with two downspouts, capping of three garage doors and capping of wooden trim, all to be installed on a new garage building located on Mr. McKay’s land.
[2] Mr. Lawson completed work on Mr. McKay’s garage and presented a written invoice to Mr. McKay in the sum of $2,800.00.
Mr. McKay has not paid Mr. Lawson’s account.
Mr. McKay was dissatisfied with the work of Mr. Lawson.
Mr. McKay hired others to repair the work.
He takes the position that Mr. Lawson’s claim should be dismissed.
[3] On October 14th, 2008, Mr. Lawson caused to be registered at the Land Titles Registry, Province of Saskatchewan a claim of lien under The Builders’ Lien Act, S.S. 1984-85-86, c. B-7.1, as am.
[5] The following affidavits are evidence in the matter before me: 1.","A charge of failing to yield, contrary to s.50(3) of the Highway Traffic Act.
The collision caused extensive damage to the defendant's vehicle and totaled the second.
Two passengers were knocked unconscious.
One sustained a bruised collar bone and the other required stitches to the head.
HELD: The defendant was found not guilty.
His action did not fall short of the standard of care demanded of ordinary prudent drivers faced with similar circumstances.
The defence of due diligence was established with respect to the failing to yield.
The second requirement of s.50(3) is that the defendant shall not make a turn until he has afforded a reasonable opportunity to the approaching vehicle to avoid a collision.
It was found as a fact that that when he commenced his turn, any lawfully vehicle approaching from the opposite direction would have been able to avoid the collision.
 1)Since the defendant turned across the path of the on-coming vehicle and since they came into collision, it would appear prima facie that he failed to yield as required by s.50(3).
The right of way, however, is not absolute.
As most regulatory offences s. 50(3) is an offence of strict liability which means that once it is established the defendant did the prohibited act, it is open to him to establish a defence of due diligence on a balance of probabilities. 2)Speeding by the second vehicle was a contributing factor.
It could not be determined whether the second vehicle had only its parking lights on.
Neither road nor weather conditions appeared to have been a factor.
Alcohol was not a factor.
Visibility was reasonably good given the time of day and the fact the intersection was lit by street lights.
3)When the defendant commenced his turn across the path of the second vehicle he was entitled to assume it was safe to do so as there did not appear to be any other vehicle close enough to the intersection to present a hazard.","[4, 5, 1, 6, 3, 7, 0, 14, 2, 8]"

He sought a declaration that a member of the police service must be informed of any investigation of his conduct prior to the commencement of the investigation as required by s.54 of the Police Act.; the Act does not permit the amendment in Form A discipline notice since it is a statutory form.
The relief sought regarding disclosure had been abandoned by the applicant.
The applicant argued that the fundamental questions to be addressed revolved around issues of statutory interpretation that must be resolved on a standard of correctness and the alternative remedies were not adequate.
The respondent took the position that this Court should not entertain the application as there is a convenient alternative remedy provided in the Act by way of appeal to the provincial Police Commission; that the Chief was entitled to amend the notice and would be entitled to grant leave if required; the hearing officer erred in holding that s.54(1) of the Act requires notice of an internal investigation to be provided to the subject member.

The plaintiff, Bill Laidlaw, is a chartered accountant.
By way of a merger/purchase agreement dated September 14, 2000, he joined the partnership of MNP and became subject to the partnership agreement dated June 1, 1999.
The merger agreement provided the courts of Saskatchewan would have exclusive jurisdiction to determine all disputes and claims arising between the parties.
The merger agreement provided in part at clause 2.11 that: This Agreement shall prevail if and whenever there is any conflict or any inconsistency between the provisions of this Agreement and the MNP Partnership Agreement (as may be amended hereafter).
... 4.11 Existing Agreements - The Partners acknowledge that the Partnership has entered into and is bound by the terms of the agreements which are listed on Appendix D, which is attached to and forms part of this Agreement.
Appendix D lists a number of agreements, including merger agreements, that remain in force but did not include the merger agreement of the plaintiff.

The plaintiff took stress leave and requested to be relieved of her duties as office manager in 1998.
The action proceeded under the simplified procedure in Part Forty of the Queen's Bench Rules.
HELD: 1)The conduct amounted to constructive dismissal entitling her to withdraw services without a reduction in the notice period.
Although the defendant had numerous complaints the plaintiff was not dismissed for cause.
Her termination of employment related only to her reduced position as bookkeeper which was for an indefinite period of time.
Her employment had already been terminated by notice of nearly a year.
She remained entitled to notice to March 31, 1999 at her salary at the time of termination and to medical expenses that would have been covered but without bonuses or extra payments for sick pay.
2)The defendant did not establish the plaintiff ought to have done more to mitigate her loss.
There was no basis for punitive damages nor for an extension of the period of notice.
 3)The net earnings between May 1998 and March 1999 were deducted after deducting $50 for the cost of qualifying for that employment.
Amounts owing by the plaintiff to the defendant were to be deducted.
4)The plaintiff was entitled to interest in accordance with the Pre-judgment Interest Act.

[2] Mr. Gitzel’s position is there was no evidence that could support a finding that the firewood he sold to an undercover officer was wood harvested from Crown lands.
He asks, if there is no proof he unlawfully harvested wood or unlawfully possessed wood, how could he be found guilty of unlawfully trafficking in it?
He says his conviction on the trafficking charge should be quashed.
[3] For its part, the Crown has appealed the sentence imposed taking the position that a fine of $1,000 with a 40% surcharge was an unreasonably low penalty for the offence the evidence established.
It needs to be noted that the acquittals on the charges of unlawfully harvesting and unlawfully possessing forest products have not been appealed.

The plaintiffs brought a claim in contract and tort alleging Hagblom caused a fire in their building.
The third party claim alleged negligence by the city's fire department in managing the fire and in the post-fire investigation.
The third parties argued that, subject to their duty to act in good faith, they could not be found liable to the defendants in negligence.
In issue was whether s.136.1(2) of the Urban Municipality Act and s.34 of the Fire Prevention Act prevented the defendants from taking proceedings against the third parties; whether certain paragraphs should be struck on the basis the common law does not recognize a cause of action for spoiled or destroyed evidence and failure to assist in gathering evidence on the basis the third parties did not owe a statutory duty to the defendants; whether certain paragraphs should be struck as the defendants had not obtained leave to bring third party proceedings as required by s.7 of the Contributory Negligence Act.
HELD: The application was dismissed.
Leave was granted nunc pro tunc to bring third party proceedings.
(1)The third party claim disclosed a reasonable cause of action.
It was not plain and obvious the claim could not succeed.
It was arguable on the pleadings that the third parties did not act in good faith in that it was alleged they deliberately set out to suppress information and destroy evidence.
(2)The statutory limitations will not nullify the third party claim if the allegations relevant to the contention that the third parties did not act in good faith are proven.","[0, 4, 9, 1, 14, 6, 12, 2, 8, 7]"

The applicants, charged separately, plead not guilty to cultivation and possession of marijuana and sought to have the evidence obtained pursuant to the authorizations for electronic surveillance and search warrant be excluded from trial and requested a stay of proceedings on all charges.
 They argued the search warrant, which resulted in the seizure of 365 marijuana plants, should be set aside on the additional grounds police officers allowed two news media camera crews onto the premises to film during the course of the search thereby rendering the search unreasonable pursuant to s.8 of the Charter.
The primary ground was that the police did not try any available investigative procedures before applying for a surveillance authorization.
As the matter was not urgent s.186(1)(b) of the Criminal Code was not complied with.
The Crown objected to the defences' reliance on portions of the preliminary inquiry.
The Crown produced an edited copy of the affidavits in support of the electronic and video surveillance warrants wherein all dates and other information were deleted to protect the identity of a principal source of information.
HELD: The application for a stay of proceedings was dismissed.
The evidence obtained pursuant to the electronic surveillance and the video surveillance warrant were ruled inadmissible at trial.
The search warrant respecting the residence was set aside.
The seriousness of the charge combined with the real evidence of the 365 marijuana plants outweighed the breach of the Charter s.8 right to be secure from unreasonable search and seizure.
The exclusion of the evidence obtained from the search of the premises would bring the administration of justice into disrepute.
1)The portions of the preliminary inquiry transcript were allowed by way of affidavit subject to the right of the Crown to call amplification evidence.
 2)The affidavit in support of the authorizations were considered solely on the basis of the edited copies. 3)The affidavit did disclose a current offence.
It was not obvious why the Crown edited out the dates.
4)The 1997 authorization was set aside.
The search was unreasonable and in breach of s.8 of the Charter.
The s.186(1)(b) pre-conditions for granting an authorization were not met.
There was no information contained in the affidavit or the amplification evidence which could support an objective standard that other investigative procedures were unlikely to succeed.
The impression given the issuing judge was false and misleading.
The fact pattern was the reverse of that in Dosch.
The information was limited to the existence of a marijuana grow operation on a rural acreage owned by Derksen with whom Begrand-Fast was alleged to be involved.
Neither had a criminal record.
The boilerplate paragraphs as to why other investigative procedures were unlikely to succeed had no factual basis.
 5)The information submitted to establish reasonable and probable grounds was exclusively information obtained from the electronic surveillance authorization.
A good faith argument was not available because the information submitted in support of the warrant was tainted by the conduct utilized to obtain the authorization.
The evidence obtained was equally a product of a serious infringement of the applicant's s.8 Charter rights because once the tainted evidence was excised for the affidavit in support there was no evidence supporting the issuance of the warrant.
The privacy interest was comparatively high.
The nature of the constitutional breach was major.
The means of obtaining the authorization was misleading because the reasons offered for not conducting a further investigation lacked a factual basis.
6)The residence search warrant was set aside.
The affidavit provided no indication of the source of the informer's knowledge.
The issuing justice was therefore unable to assess the reliability or the credibility of the information.
The fact the source is credible does not mean the information provided is reliable.
7)The seriousness of the breach was not at the high end of the scale.
There was an attempt to comply with the Criminal Code and two of the three requirements were met.
While good faith was not found with respect to the information offered in support of the electronic authorization, there was nothing in the information presented with respect to the search warrant that lead to a conclusion of bad faith.
On balance the administration of justice would not be brought into disrepute with the admissibility of this evidence.
 8)The Criminal Code makes no provision to add the names of civilians to a search warrant.
The reasoning in R. v. West applied and the search of the Derksen residence was conducted in an unreasonable manner contrary to s.8 of the Charter.
A Collins analysis favoured the inclusion of the evidence including the plants.
The police were attentive to privacy issues in supervising and restricting the television cameras.
The officer set grounds rules that the residence could not be identified in any broadcast.
The drug section was not the initiator of inviting the media along.
It was coincidence that the corporal did so on a search where the warrant was subsequently held to be invalid.
The two events did not amount to a course of conduct.
9)The improper seizure and retention of personal property of the accused was a collateral matter and did not affect the fairness of the trial.","[5, 7, 4, 16, 21, 19, 1, 11, 14, 22, 13, 24, 34, 2, 8]"
347,"Saskatchewan Court of Queen's Bench Citation: Toronto Dominion Bank v. Sheppard Date: 1998-08-06 Docket: Estevan Q.B.
169/96 Between: Toronto Dominion Bank, Plaintiff and Bernard Allan Sheppard and Lila Sheppard, Defendants Before: McIntyre J.
Appearances: S.G. Segal, for the Toronto Dominion Bank I.D.
Wagner, for Bernard Allan Sheppard and Lila Sheppard McIntyre J.: [1] The defendants seek to set aside a default judgment entered by the plaintiff against them and have the plaintiff's claim struck out.
The defendants abandoned their alternate claim to be granted leave to file a statement of defence.
[2] The statement of claim alleges: • The defendants received cheque number 70919 dated February 13, 1995, drawn on the plaintiff bank by Tri-Link Resources in the amount of $18,442.39.
The defendants carried on business as a hauling sub-contractor to Tri-Link Resources.
• The cheque was subsequently reported as lost by the defendant, Bernard Sheppard.
• Tri-Link issued cheque number 71066 as a replacement cheque.
• Cheque number 71066 was deposited to the defendants' account at the Royal Bank in Carlyle, Saskatchewan, on February 21, 1995.
• The defendant, Lila Sheppard, had cheque number 70919 certified at a branch of the plaintiff in Calgary, Alberta.
[3] The plaintiff sought judgment against the defendants in the amount of $18,442.39 plus interest.","A jury determined the plaintiff was constructively dismissed from his employment as park superintendent in 1997 and awarded damages for failure to give reasonable notice.
The defendant claimed the contract of employment was all inclusive; that the plaintiff exaggerated the amount of time he spent on the job in winter; that the reduced winter hours were not in lieu of overtime pay as he was a manager within the meaning of s.4(2) of the LSA; the doctrine of estoppel or waiver applied as he never claimed a right to holiday pay for 10 years and the employer relied on his not doing so; if the plaintiff is entitled to holiday pay he should only recover back to April 1990 as he is limited by the Limitation of Actions Act; it should not be based on wages plus truck allowance as wages as defined in the LSA does not include allowances for costs.
The claim for unpaid holiday pay claimed from April 1988 to October 1997, based on his wages plus one-half his truck expense allowance, was reserved pending a decision by the Court of Appeal as to whether the Court of Queen's Bench has jurisdiction to determine the issue of entitlement to holiday pay.
HELD: The claim was dismissed with costs.
 1)The Court of Appeal held in Kolodziejski v. Auto Electric Service that the Queens' Bench has jurisdiction to entertain a civil action for non-payment of holiday pay. 2)The plaintiff may rely on s.30(1) of the LSA to establish he is entitled to holidays and on s.33 to establish he entitled to pay in lieu of taking holidays.
The onus then shifts to the defendant to prove it complied with some exception in the LSA.
Section 75 prevents an employee from waiving his or her entitlement.
Whether the plaintiff asserted his right to holiday pay or not, he remained entitled to his annual holidays in accordance with the LSA. 3)The plaintiff can claim for any holiday pay in lieu of time off that he can establish he was entitled to from April 1990 to his termination date.
Section 3(1)(f)of the LAA states that a cause of action for recovery of money under a contract, express or implied, must be commenced within 6 years of the date on which the cause arose.
4)The plaintiff clearly indicated that a portion of the truck allowance was made to avoid paying tax.
As such it would be contrary to public policy for the Court to appear to endorse the plaintiff's actions by calculating his holiday pay on the basis of his wage and this portion of his truck allowance.
 5)The defendant's position that the contract included a component of holiday pay each month was inconsistent with its position that the plaintiff took these days off as holidays during the year.
The contract of employment did not include a component of holiday pay in lieu of time off.
 6)Failure by the defendant to keep records for the purpose of inspection by the minister does not result in a reverse onus.
The onus remains on the plaintiff to establish what holidays he did not take. 7)The plaintiff admitted to taking time away from his duties for personal time and for city business as mayor.
The plaintiff was not there in his capacity as superintendent.
Section 31(1)(b) indicates that an employee shall be permitted to take holidays in one uninterrupted period.
The defendant allowed the plaintiff to take days off in any manner he chose.
It was inconsistent that the plaintiff's failure to comply with the notice requirement meant for the benefit of the employer could be used by an employee to disclaim that his days off were holidays. 8)The plaintiff was clearly a manager within the meaning of LSA.
Even if he were not a manager, he failed to prove, on a balance of probabilities that he worked overtime hours in excess of the statutory minimum in order to qualify for overtime.
Any days off taken by the plaintiff could not be considered taken in lieu of overtime.
The days he was away were holidays as defined in s.30 of the LSA. 9)He did not establish he did 3 weeks holidays.","[1, 0, 3, 4, 7, 8, 2, 6, 5, 9, 12, 10]"

Issues included whether the Court should enter a stay of proceedings and award costs, given the failure of the Crown to produce a standard alcohol solution (SAS); could mouth alcohol have invalidated the roadside screening test; did the arresting officer have reasonable and probable grounds to demand a breath sample; was the accused denied his right to counsel; was the breathalyzer test administered as soon as practicable; was there evidence to the contrary?
HELD: The accused was found not guilty on count #2 (exceeding .08).
Count #1 (impaired driving) was dismissed during the trial.
 1)The court was cognizant of the burden of proof and had reviewed the decision of R. v. Lifchus concerning reasonable doubt. 2)The accused's testimony was rejected as not being credible. 3)The burden lies with the applicant on an application pursuant to ss.7 and 24(1) of the Charter in which the defence alleges the accused's right to make full answer and defence has been infringed.
The question remained whether once the defence established it sought the SAS but it was not provided for whatever reason, had it discharged its burden or must it prove the failure to produce the SAS solution could have a meaningful outcome on the trial.
4)The accused's s.7 Charter right to make full answer and defence was infringed by the failure of the Crown to produce a sample of the SAS solution in this case.
In light of the Bourget and Kalafut decisions, the Crown has had ample opportunity to establish a system for routinely saving the solution until after a case has been concluded.
It would bring the administration of justice into disrepute were the Certificate of Analysis admitted into evidence.
It was more appropriate to exclude the Certificate of Analysis than to grant a stay of proceedings.
 5)Costs are rarely awarded in criminal proceedings.
Given the evidence presented concerning the usefulness of testing a representative SAS ampule had it been produced, the court was not persuaded costs should be awarded.
6)There was no evidence that created a reasonable doubt as to the time that elapsed or that there may have been mouth alcohol which may have invalidated the roadside screening test.
Both the subjective and objective tests were met.
The arresting officer, who has no reason to believe an accused has consumed alcohol in the last 15 minutes, may administer the roadside screening test without delay, but to do so carries with it a certain risk that there may be subsequently evidence which will invalidate the results (affecting the objective element of the test).
Further, the officer has no duty to routinely wait 15 minutes before administering the test nor to ask the accused whether or not alcohol has been consumed in the preceding 15 minutes.
However, if there are circumstances which suggest the officer should have waited or inquired about alcohol consumption, this may affect the reasonableness of the officer's belief (the subjective test). 7)There was nothing in the evidence to support the submission that the speedometers need to be checked to support the officer's evidence.
The officer was acting in the lawful execution of his duty in stopping the accused's vehicle.
While doing so he detected an odour of alcohol on the accused's breath which gave rise to the demand for a roadside screening. 8)The informational component of the right to counsel was satisfied.
There was no evidence the accused misunderstood his right nor that he was not given sufficient opportunity to contact counsel.
He declined twice, giving a clear and unequivocal waiver.
Absent special circumstance, the police cannot be expected to draw information out of the accused. 9)The samples were taken as soon as practicable.
It was accepted that there was typically no one available at the detachment in the small community and was sufficient reason to not consider attending there given the proximity of the city.
The officer tried the closest detachment but found no one there.
It may have been more important to question the judgment of the officer to return to the Saskatoon detachment if the delay had been more significant.
On the face of it, the delay of 27 minutes did not seem unreasonable. 10)The statutory presumption applied.
There was no evidence to the contrary as the accused's evidence was rejected.
The court reviewed R. v. Gibson and considered s.258(1)(c) and (d.1) of the Criminal Code.","[1, 7, 17, 18, 3, 11, 4, 23, 21, 20, 22, 25, 12, 6, 13, 19, 10, 9, 5, 63, 60, 58, 64, 67, 16, 72, 70, 61, 66, 24, 14, 75, 69, 74, 80, 77, 62, 15]"

Moran for the director of Labour StandardsJUDGMENT LAWTON J.
March 23, 1994The Director of the Labour Standards Branch of the Department of Labour issued a certificate pursuant to s. 60 of The Labour Standards Act, R.S.S.
1978, c. L-1 (the ""Act""), stating that the City of Regina (the ""City"") owed its transit employee, Albert Morgan, $511.08 in wages.
At the hearing, the Director filed a March 8, 1994, letter reducing the assessment to $318.41 (including annual holiday pay).
The City brings this application to review the assessment.
By ss.
10(1) and 6(2) of the Act, an employer is required to pay an employee at the rate of time and one-half for every hour worked in excess of 32 hours in any week containing a public holiday (""holiday"").
The Director contends that from April, 1990, to January, 1994, there were five such weeks in which Morgan worked 40 hours but was not paid overtime for the eight excess hours.
The hours in question were worked on April 12 and November 17, 1990, July 6, 1991, and January 4 and December 31, 1992.
It is noted that none of these days is a holiday, but is the day in the week containing a holiday when Morgan worked the eight excess hours.","The plaintiff and defendant entered into an oral contract for the development and sale of land.
The plaintiff brought an action to recover its commission on the contract.
Plaintiff awarded commission of 4% as agreed to by the terms of the oral contract; in the alternative, the plaintiff is entitled to an award for unjust enrichment to compensate for the work done.
Although the agreement could have went on longer, there was nothing preventing it from being performed completely within one year and thus the oral agreement was not only valid, but also enforceable.
An award for unjust enrichment would be calculated using the commission rate agreed to by the parties.","[0, 1, 3, 4, 7, 8, 6, 5, 10, 11, 9, 12]"

The admitted purpose of the appellant was to use these answers as his expert evidence at trial.
Appeal allowed in part;
the chambers judge did not err in refusing to appoint the doctor as a court expert where he indicated that he did not wish to be an expert; the chambers judge did err in finding that opinion evidence is never required to be given.

Are the children, Katie, Hannah and Bobby, or any of them, children in need of protection pursuant to s. 11 of The Child and Family Services Act?
If so, what is the appropriate order to be made, respecting each of the children, pursuant to s. 37 of the Act?

Introduction [1] Kelly Gene Bromm (the “father”) appeals from the decision of the Chambers judge which varied the custody provisions of a consent judgment dated March 30, 2005 governing custody and access to the parties’ children.
The application before the Chambers judge also included child maintenance issues but the father does not appeal that part of the decision.
For the reasons hereinafter set forth, the appeal of the father is dismissed.

Background and Evidence[2] The father and Leanne Marie Bromm (the “mother”) were married in 1993 and separated in June of 2004.
The father was entitled to generous access pursuant to the agreement including each Tuesday afternoon and Thursday night and every second weekend.
[3] In March of 2005 the father applied for a divorce judgment and the terms of the separation agreement with respect to custody and access were incorporated into the consent judgment.

Richmond for Guy PoirierJUDGMENT KRAUS J. October 26, 1999[1] Guy Poirier farms with his father and brother.
They operated 5000 acres in 1997 but reduced their operation to 2000 acres the following year because of losses caused by low grain prices.
[2] In 1997, Mr. Poirier acquired a sprayer.
Its value was agreed to be $94,600.00 by the parties.
Mr. Poirier did not have $23,650.00, being 25% of the agreed value, as down payment, but he did have a trade-in which was agreed to have a value of $10,000.00.
The evidence is clear that the parties treated the trade-in as the advance payment (but the Agreement does not define it in that way) even though the value of the trade-in does not equal the amount of the advance payment; the difference being $679.33 (between $10,000.00 and $9,320.67).
[3] The central issue is whether the Agreement is a lease or a security agreement.
Case Credit argues that it is a lease and that liquidated damages should be awarded in accordance with clause two.","The appellant, who received a suspended sentence with a one year probation order, appealed his conviction of assault (Criminal Code s.266) on the grounds the trial judge erred in law in making findings of fact and credibility based on evidence that did not exist (photographs of injuries that were not introduced into evidence at trial); by misapplying the appropriate standard of proof; although correctly articulating the test in R. v. W(D), misapplying that test in determining credibility; by failing to apply the appropriate test for a defence of necessity.
The complainant, frightened by the sudden verbal outburst of the appellant, fled into the bush and refused to return because his mood had not changed.
The trial judge did not accept the appellant's testimony that he used force only to protect the complainant from natural hazards in that location at night.
HELD: The appeal was allowed.
The conviction was set aside and a new trial was ordered.
1)Finding that there were photographs to corroborate the testimony of the complainant relating to her injuries was an error of law.
No miscarriage of justice resulted from that error, as it was immaterial.
 2)The trial judge clearly preferred the testimony of the complainant to that of the appellant but did not state why.
It could not be concluded that his belief in the existence of photographs influenced the findings of credibility.
Even if it did, there was still ample evidence to support a prima facie case of assault.
Again no miscarriage of justice resulted.
3)The trial judge erred in law by failing to properly consider the defence of necessity.
The three elements that must be present for a defence of necessity, as determined by the SCC in Latimer, include imminent peril or danger; absence of reasonable alternatives; proportionality between the harm inflicted and the harm avoided.
The defence of necessity is considered in cases where there is an air of reality.
The only evidence relating to the defence of necessity came from the appellant.
It would not be appropriate in the circumstances of this case to substitute an acquittal.
Had the trial judge applied the appropriate test, he may have come to a different conclusion.","[0, 1, 3, 2, 5, 6, 4, 9, 8, 14, 10, 13, 12, 7]"

[1] The parties divorced in 1992 and at that time the appellant was ordered to pay $200 a month support for their child.
The appellant later entered into a new relationship and he and his common-law spouse had a mentally handicapped child born in 1995.
In 1996, the appellant was laid off from his employment and heceased making his support payments.
He remained at home to care for the child.
In 1997, his common-law spouse died suddenly and he has since remained the sole care and support of the child.
He used his common-law spouse’s modest insurance proceeds for living expenses and he made no payment towards the accumulated arrears of support.","FIAT. An application by two siblings to act as personal decision makers and property guardians for their 68 year old mother, who suffers from Alzheimer's.
Although their four siblings consented, the Public Trustee opposed their appointment as property guardians without a bond.
This is one of a number of cases similarly contested by the Public Trustee since the Adult Guardianship and Co-Decision-Making Act was proclaimed July 15, 2001.
Under the previous Dependent Adults Act, the Public Trustee was not served with notices of and did not intervene in applications for property guardianship and the practice for when a bond was required was ad hoc.
The prescribed amount by regulation is $10,000.
Arguments advanced by applicants generally is that a bond is expensive; in many cases the proposed applicants do not have adequate assets, which equal or exceed the value of the estate; the court has the power under the Adult Guardianship and Co-Decision-Making Act s.47(1)(a) to place any limitations or conditions on the guardianship it considers appropriate.
HELD: The application to be appointed personal decision makers was granted.
No order was made with respect to the application for property guardianship.
The requirement for a bond is mandatory under the new Act as indicated by the use of the word 'shall' unless an applicant can qualify for dispensation under s.55(4).
Under s.55(4)(b), it is no longer adequate for the nearest relatives to consent to the appointment.
The only discretion is in s.55(4)(c) where the court may dispense with a bond in any other situation the court considers appropriate.
Reading the section as a whole and bearing in mind both its purpose, context and historical evolution, the word 'appropriate' means suitable or appropriate for the end in view, which is to ensure the adult's estate remains intact during the guardianship, or can be restored in the event it does not.
To consider this an appropriate case to dispense with a bond would be to largely negate the mandatory requirement for the filing of a bond contained in s.55(1).","[2, 0, 3, 4, 1, 5, 6, 7]"

[2] Since the issuance of the order the respondent has been, for the most part, unemployed by reason of health problems and, as a result, arrears of child support are constantly accruing.
[3] The respondent is involved in litigation against the Government of Canada wherein he seeks damages for abuse he allegedly suffered while attending an Indian Residential School.
Affidavits indicate that examinations for discovery are complete but the respondent’s solicitor handling that claim advises no offer to settle has been received.
[4] The petitioner brings an application seeking an order that:(a) the Respondent, [M.E.H.
], is hereby restrained from disposing of any money that he has received or may receive in relation to the lawsuit without further Order of the Court with the exception of paying any and all legal fees and disbursements plus taxes owing to his solicitors.

The defendant and three others had set out to check a tuna pen.
The boat was owned by a fourth individual, who was not present at the time.
One of the men, despite having no experience diving with scuba equipment and being advised against it by the others, insisted on diving to check the pen.
He died of drowning due to inexperienced scuba diving.
Defendant not guilty of the offence charged; the defendant was not the deceased's employer.
All four individuals thought of themselves as self-employed fishermen and had a profit-sharing agreement; the evidence did not establish that the defendant was acting as skipper or captain in the owner's absence; the defendant was not operating the vessel and the evidence did not show that the defendant had any kind of authority over the other fishers.
The deceased was dependant on the boat's owner for the boat and part of the gear, for another individual for the licence and on the defendant for the balance of the gear; the relationship was closer to that of independent contractor than that of employer-employee.","[1, 2, 0, 3, 4, 6, 7, 5, 8, 9, 13, 11]"

Introduction [1] The issue on this appeal is the priority of a security interest in a mobile home granted by Johnathon Nickel to Robert Lanson and Sharon Severson (Lanson) and a subsequent purchaser for value, the Saskatchewan Valley Credit Union (the Credit Union), having regard to the operation of s. 28(1) and s. 30(2) of The Personal Property Security Act, 1993[1] (P.P.S.A.).
Facts [2] The facts are not in dispute and are fully set out in the judgment of the trial judge.
To facilitate an understanding of this oral judgment a brief recitation of the facts will suffice.
[3] Lanson loaned Nickel $16,000 to purchase a mobile home.
Lanson registered their financing statement giving them a security interest in the mobile home.
At trial it was found that Lanson knew that Nickel would either rent to sell the mobile home, their only concern being that upon a sale Nickel would repay the loan in full.","Fulltext of judgment follows:[1]
We do not need to hear from counsel for the respondent.
I mentioned during the opening of this appeal that members of the panel had followed the usual practice of carefully reviewing the trial record and written arguments before this hearing.[2]
We are all of the view that there is no basis to interfere with the decision of Mr. Justice Smith.
As his extensive reasons for decision disclose he addressed the matter thoroughly.
[3] This was a difficult case in which the trial judge was required to carefully address the competing claims for custody, but mindful of the 'best interests of the child'.
Throughout the trial and in his reasons the learned trial judge focussed on this predominant issue.
And in our view he addressed it as required by law.
[4] We cannot say that the learned trial judge erred in any material respect when weighing and considering the evidence.
Since the parties were unable to resolve the issues to their mutual satisfaction, it fell to the trial judge to make a 'hard choice'.
He had the distinct advantage, that we do not have, of seeing and hearing the parties and being able to form an impression of them.
[5] We dismiss this appeal with costs on double Column 5.
[6] We cannot part from this appeal without noting the acrimonious history of litigation concerning custody and access.
The welfare of [B.E.] would be better served by a spirit of compromise.
The time, energy and expenses incurred in protracted litigation could be put to better use in advancing the welfare of this young child.","[0, 4, 5, 3, 6, 1, 8, 7]"

May 30, 2013 [1] Further to the hearing of this matter on May 7, 2013, the issue remaining to be determined is whether the children are to be, on an interim basis, relocated from La Ronge to live with the respondent at Melville, Saskatchewan.
BACKGROUND[2] The parties commenced a common-law relationship in February, 2000.
There are two children of the relationship, namely: Justin Morgan McKerracher born May 31, 2001 and Sean Lucas McKerracher born September 26, 2004.
[3] The parties separated in April of 2010, while living in La Ronge, Saskatchewan.
The initial parenting arrangement was that the children resided with the respondent and with the petitioner having access on the weekends.
The petitioner’s uncontradicted evidence is that on January 1, 2011, the parents agreed to a verbal co-parenting arrangement.
The arrangement that was in place until March 31, 2012, was that the children would change their residence between the parents on each Monday after school.
The children have primarily resided in La Ronge or the Air Ronge District of Saskatchewan.
[4] The evidence discloses that the respondent had sold her home and business in La Ronge by March of 2013.","The accused was charged with driving a motor vehicle with a blood alcohol level exceeding .08.
The Crown filed a certificate of analysis pursuant to s. 258(1)(g) of the Criminal Code for the purpose of proving the accused's blood alcohol level.
The word and symbol 'Breathalyzer' had a line drawn through them and above the same was written 'Intoxilyzer'.
There was no symbol with it.
In the blank that followed was written '5000C'.
This change was not initialed.
The issue was whether s. 258(1)(g) of the Code requires that the approved instrument be identified by way of make and model.
HELD: The charge was dismissed.
The Court found the Crown could not rely on s. 258(1)(g) of the Code and there was no evidence of the accused's blood level.
1) The Court found that in order for a certificate of analysis under s. 258(1)(g) of the Code to constitute evidence as set out in that subsection, the make and model of the approved instrument has to be set out in the certificate or be proven by other evidence.
 2) It was not possible to know who made the alteration.
The use of a certificate is a shortcut afforded to the Crown.
If it is to be employed, it must be employed correctly.
In the circumstances, the approved instrument was not adequately identified as to make and model.","[1, 4, 0, 7, 8, 6, 3, 12, 5, 9, 10]"
360," THE COURT OF APPEAL FOR SASKATCHEWAN BANK OF MONTREAL(Plaintiff) APPELLANT - and - I.M.
I find myself in respectful disagreement with my colleague Wakeling's analysis and conclusion.
Whether money owed under a guaranteed investment certificate (“GIC”) is a debt ""accruing due"" under subsection 5(1) of The Attachment of Debts Act, R.S.S.
1978, c. A-32 and therefore subject to garnishment cannot be determined by reference only to garnishability of promissory notes not yet due.
Other cases pertaining to similar debts must also be rationalized.
It is for this reason I have embarked on my own analysis and arrived at a different conclusion.
This instrument is not cashable and therefore cannot be redeemed prior to maturity.""
Thus, to successfully enforce its judgment, a judgment creditor must be able to prove a ""debt due or accruing due"" from the garnishee to the judgment debtor.
As a preliminary matter, this judgment’s scope should be clearly delineated.
The GIC should have been held and paid out to the Bank, barring proof of a better claim, on the GIC's maturity date.
This right of assignment, it was argued, either prevented the debt from accruing due or made it a conditional one and therefore not garnishable.","Following the close of the Crown's case on a trial of several weapons related offences, the defence moved for a directed verdict on the basis that there was no evidence that the offences occurred on the date alleged in the Information.
The Crown sought to amend the Information to change the date of the offences.
Without ruling on the motion to amend, the trial judge granted the motion for a directed verdict.
The Crown appealed.
Appeal allowed; acquittals set aside; new trial ordered.
The directed verdict should not have been granted as, in this case, the date of the offences was not an essential element of the offences.
If the directed verdict was not based on the discrepancy with the date, than the appeal would have to be allowed on the basis that the trial judge gave insufficient reasons which prejudiced the Crown's right of appeal.","[0, 7, 6, 5, 14, 21, 4, 24, 8, 30, 32]"

The issue which has been raised in these proceedings is whether it is appropriate for the court to require the accused to commence the trial by calling evidence on a Charter voir dire, where the accused has given notice of a Charter application.
This would differ from the procedure which is usually utilized, wherein the Crown commences the trial by calling its witnesses in the trial proper, and thereafter the accused applies to the court for leave to apply the Crown evidence to the Charter application, where it is appropriate to do so, and in addition to calling other defence evidence on the application.
2.
I have reviewed the authorities which have been filed by the Crown.
I note that the judgment of Finlayson, J.A., in R. v. Kutynec (1992), 1992 CanLII 12755 (ON CA), 52 O.A.C.

The father now applied for interim sole custody, alleging that the ongoing extreme conflict between the parties was adversely affecting the children.

Father granted interim sole care, custody and control of the children.

She also applied for a determination that Bryan Willick (the father) was in arrears of maintenance and that he provide to her 5 years of retroactive child support.
[3] For the following reasons we have concluded that the learned trial judge made no palpable and overriding error in his finding that the father was not in arrears of maintenance and that there would be no order for retroactive child support.
Nevertheless, we have also concluded that he was in error in determining that Nicole and Kirsti were no longer children of the marriage within the meaning of the Act.
II.
Facts [4] The parties married on August 25, 1979, separated in March of 1989, and divorced in November of 1989.
At the time of the separation Nicole was 3 years old and Kirsti a mere 6 months old.
At the date of trial Nicole and Kirsti were nearly 23 and 20 respectively.
The daughters lived with and were raised by the mother in Saskatchewan.
Pursuant to an inter-spousal agreement dated July 29, 1989, the mother had sole custody of them.
The father cashed in any RESPs when he left Canada and no further scholarship fund was established by him for either of the daughters thereafter.","The parties separated in October 2003.

The issues in this case began long before the notice of termination of tenancy (which ultimately prompted this Court's involvement) and stem from a number of complaints made by both the tenants and the landlord.
The landlord, Mr. Helmut Reich, began leasing his premises to Achim Lohse and Isabelle Dailly on August l, l993.
The tenancy was not an amicable one.
The tenants applied first to the Rentalsman's Office early in 1994 for an order directing the landlord to do certain repairs and maintenance.
A hearing was held on March 21, 1994.
On this same day the landlord served the tenants with a notice of termination of tenancy.
The deputy rentalsman who conducted the hearing on this first complaint released his decision on May 3, 1994 at which time he ordered the landlord to remove a stove, replace a refrigerator and make appropriate repairs to floor tiles, fence and gate.","Six years after the action was commenced, the plaintiff applied to add the defendant's Section D insurer in order to add a cause of action against an unidentified driver.
The limitation period for suing under Section D had expired and no notice of the application had been given to the insurer.
The chambers judge held that he had no discretion to grant the amendment and dismissed the application.
The plaintiff appealed.
Appeal allowed; the plaintiff is entitled to renew the application for the amendment in Supreme Court chambers on notice to the proposed, as well as the existing, defendant within sixty days of today's date; if not filed within that time, the application to add the insurer will be deemed to have been abandoned.
The court had a discretion to grant the amendment even though the case did not fall within any of the specific situations set out in Rule 15.02 as the broad power to amend conferred by Rule 15 is not limited to the specific instances set out the Rule.
Although there was no firm rule that notice to a proposed defendant was necessary in all such applications, generally the applicant should give notice to the proposed defendant (as well as the existing parties) where it is apparent from the circumstances that the proposed defendant likely has a reasonable basis to oppose being joined, such as being prejudiced in its defence by the plaintiff's long delay in asserting his claim.","[1, 3, 6, 4, 5, 2, 7, 0]"

Hanna is a member of the Moosomin Family Clinic which he owns, and Crouse and Kirsch practise family medicine in the Moosomin Family Practice Centre which they established in 1994.
[3] All three medical practitioners were, during the period under discussion, members of the medical staff of the Moosomin Union Hospital where all retained privileges.
The Moosomin Union Hospital is a general health care facility under the control of the Pipestone District Health Board.
[4] Soon after they formed their clinic, Crouse and Kirsch initiated an on-call system whereby all the medical practitioners having privileges at the hospital would perform on a rotation basis the on-call duties required of them by the hospital.
The proposed system was completely voluntary.
A doctor could join or not join.
[6] The arrangement proposed by Crouse and Kirsch had one doctor respond on a rotation basis to the hospital's call for treatment of all patients, regardless of which doctor had admitted them, and to all emergencies.

Unknown to the court, the father's common law partner had an extensive child protection history.
There were significant problems in the father's home, resulting in the older child removing herself from her father's care and going to live with an adult relative who also had a child protection history and the younger child disappearing for a time until the mother, who lived in Nova Scotia, finally tracked him down.
The mother now sought the return of both children.
The Nova Scotia agency sought to have its involvement terminated, arguing that both children were now old enough to self-protect.
Although the younger child wished to return to the mother, the older child threatened to run away if removed from her current living situation.
Children removed from the supervised care of the father and placed in the temporary care of the Nova Scotia agency with access to the mother and services to be provided to the mother and the children; the agency misled both the mother and the court by failing to disclose crucial information about the father's common law partner and the circumstances of the children once they were placed with the father and this failure was both inexplicable and inexcusable; costs are the appropriate remedy against the agency.
Although the mother had completed some counseling, there was a substantial risk that both children would suffer physical harm if returned to her care due to her inability to supervise and protect them adequately.

McKay, Q.C.
on behalf of the Public Trustee JUDGMENT ARCHAMBAULT J. November 3, 1997The Minister of Social Services has applied for an order that the Public Trustee be served with notice of a protection hearing and act as litigation guardian for H.B.
H.B.
is the mother of the child, R.J.B., Jr., born January 5, 1995, and is alleged to be of ""unsound mind"".
The child was apprehended at birth and is currently the subject of a child protection hearing.
In support of his application the Minister relies on The Public Trustee Act, S.S. 1983, c. P- 43.1 as amended, and, alternatively, on the court's inherent parens patriae jurisdiction.
The application is opposed by the Public Trustee who takes the position ""that it is not the appropriate party to act as the litigation guardian on behalf of H.B.""
and that ""The Public Trustee Act does not give the Public Trustee the jurisdiction to represent an adult under mental disability in cases other than where a property interest is involved"".","The applicants apply for leave to appeal a decision wherein the Court denied the applicants leave to add the Aboriginal Healing Foundation as a defendant and denying the applicants leave to amend the statement of claim by inserting the document entitled 'Addendum to the Original Statement of Claim in Support of the Notice of Motion to Amend the above Claim'.

They are both much too irresponsible to have the care and control of all or any of their children.","The Crown appeals an order from Provincial Court declaring that the accused is unfit to stand trial.
The accused was charged with 29 offences arising out of failures to comply with multiple bail conditions.
He was also charged with two indictable thefts.
He is 22 years old and suffers from fetal alcohol spectrum disorder, attention deficit disorder and substance abuse.
He was diagnosed as mildly mentally retarded and is considered incapable of handling the responsibilities that would enable him to live independently and will always need a protected living environment and sheltered employment.
He was found unfit to stand trial on some previous property offences and is still under the supervision of the Provincial Review Board.
The trial judge was satisfied that the accused met the first two criteria for fitness to stand trial Ã» he understood the nature of the charges against him and the possible consequences of being found guilty and he understood the difference between a guilty and not guilty plea.
The focus of the decision was whether the accused had the capacity to communicate with counsel.
The judge found that the accused would not be able to provide instruction to counsel during the trial process due in part to the fact that he is very distractable and could not sufficiently follow court proceedings to instruct counsel.
HELD: Appeal allowed.
The verdict of unfit to stand trial is set aside and a new trial ordered.
The trial judge applied too stringent a test on concluding that the accused was unfit to stand trial and when the proper test is applied, it is apparent that the accused has the capacity to instruct counsel within the meaning of the Code.
The trial judge's concern about the accused's distractable nature does not accord with the limited cognitive capacity test.
The Courts have applied a test of 'limited cognitive capacity' for determining fitness.
This test requires that, with respect to communicating to counsel, the accused is only required to be capable of recounting the fact of the alleged crimes.
Limited cognitive capacity does not require analytic ability or the need for the accused to appreciate his own best interests.
The authorities establish a very low threshold for fitness to stand trial in keeping with the policy objectives of the Criminal Code and the right of the accused to make full answer and defence.","[1, 0, 4, 3, 6, 5, 8, 7, 9, 12, 13, 11]"

[47] 3.","The divorcing parties disagreed about whether the wife's son from a previous relationship (now 13) was a 'child of the marriage.'
While they lived together for seven years and had one child together, they were married for less than a year.
The wife alleged the husband had stood in the place of a parent to the child.
She claimed this was evidenced by the fact that: he started acting like a dad before the parties lived together (when the child was two); he was involved in things like medical appointments and school activities; the child's biological father only recently became involved; and they had discussed adoption early in the relationship.
The evidence showed the decision to allow the child's biological father to assume an increasing role in his life was made solely by the wife.
The child no longer had contact with the husband.
The child is not a 'child of the marriage.'
The husband did not stand in the place of a parent to him.
He was a big part of the child's life but his role was mostly incidental to the relationship with the wife and a normal part of living with a child.
The marriage was short and the father's parenting role was diminished before the marriage (by the mother's choice to allow the biological father back into the child's life, and the parties' failure to pursue the idea of adoption that was raised early on).
Applying the Supreme Court's decision in Cook (2000), the threshold for finding parental status is high and reserved for cases where a person can clearly be shown to have assumed a parental role in substantial substitution for the biological parent.
Such is not the case here.","[1, 11, 4, 2, 35, 43, 7, 38, 59, 39, 41, 5, 6, 58, 9, 23, 57, 33, 66, 54]"

The proposed appellants sought and obtained a writ of replevin in relation to the dogs.
The proposed respondent applied for an order setting aside the writ, and ordering the dogs returned.
The chambers judge granted the application finding that the affidavit filed in support of the writ contained false and misleading information and that to allow the writ to stand would constitute an abuse of process.
The issue on appeal is whether the chambers judge erred in inquiring into the accuracy of the facts sworn to in the proposed appellant's affidavit, in light of the provision in Rule 407(2) of the Queen's Bench Rules that provides that the validity of the writ shall not be questioned in any interlocutory proceeding where the affidavit substantially complies with the requirements of the Rule.

The father is a dentist practicing in Melfort, and was so at the time of the divorce.
Mother was then without employment.
History of the Proceedings in F.L.D.
:The parties married August 23, 1980 and separated in September 1988.
They entered into a separation agreement in December of 1988 in which they agreed to joint custody, residence with the father and generous access to the mother.
That agreement contained a provision thatIt shall be a joint decision of the husband and wife to remove the children from the Province of Saskatchewan for any reason other than a short vacation.
In July, 1990, the mother commenced an application to vary the divorce judgment by granting mother sole custody of the boys, or joint custody with principal residence with mother.
She based this application upon the grounds that she was being denied access, or was having difficulty with access.
A pre-trial was ordered on the issue.
The report indicates that the father married June 1990, Sharon Poncelet, mother of 3 children, and those children moved into the father's home with his own 2 boys.
The report was filed with the court July 31, 1991 and recommended that the joint custody with principal residence with father continue.","A bankruptcy petition against the applicant was filed on May 18, 1995 and a receiving order with respect to her property issued the following month.

The respondent seeks a declaration declining jurisdiction, or an order of joint custody, pursuant to the Act.
[2] The parties were married in 1994.
They are both university graduates and teachers.
The petitioner was employed as a substitute teacher at Richmond, British Columbia until the time of the birth of their son when she became a full time homemaker.
The respondent continues to be employed as a full time high school teacher in Richmond.
[3] The parties have two children: their son will be six years of age in June and their daughter will four years of age in May.
They have always resided in the matrimonial home with their parents in Richmond, until the 3rd day of November, 2000, when the petitioner removed them from the matrimonial home and brought them to Regina.
The son had been enrolled in kindergarten in Richmond, across the street from the matrimonial home, up to the time of the move.

October 16, 1998 [1] The applicant is the mother and has sole custody of Cynthia Kelsey O'Brien, born December 4, 1989, a child of the parties.
By order dated June 7, 1996, the respondent, Kevin O'Brien is required to pay $750.00 per month to the applicant as maintenance for the said child.
[2] The applicant applies, pursuant to s. 17 of the Divorce Act, R.S.C.
1985, c. 3 (2nd Supp), to vary this order and to obtain an order that the respondent provide maintenance in accordance with the Federal Child Support Guidelines (SOR/97-175).
The applicant swears, inter alia, that ""his income is at least $111,178.00 per year and can be imputed to be more"", and further ""from April 1, 1997 to March 31, 1998, the respondent's income was a salary of $65,122.00 taxable income and $46,056.00 non-taxable income"" and ""he gets a salary plus extra pay for working on commissions created by the government"" and, finally, she expects he would earn income from other sources.","The plaintiff bought a house.
She used the services of Cecilia Mui, a realtor associated with the defendant 100% Realty Associates Ltd. operating as Re/max Saskatoon.
The house was purchased from the defendants Edward and Verl Karpinski.
The vendors' realtor was the defendant, Mario Jacobucci, owner of the defendant Trevi Holdings Ltd. The house did not meet the plaintiff's expectations.
She now sues the defendants seeking recovery of damages for alleged latent defects.
She claims Ms. Mui fell below the standard of care required of a realtor representing a purchaser.
She claims Ms. Mui was negligent in misrepresenting certain facts and breached the fiduciary duty expected of her.
The plaintiff claims the Karpinskis misrepresented facts to her, negligently and fraudulently.
The plaintiff claims that Mr. Jacobucci and his company are liable to her in damages, both in negligence and as parties to the misrepresentations made by the vendors.
Special and general damages are claimed as are aggravated damages and punitive damages.
The trial took place over 22 days, spanning several years and included testimony from 14 witnesses.
Two main issues are raised.
The first is the liability of each of the defendants.
The second issue is quantum of damages.
The credibility of the parties is at the forefront of the determination of the issues.
HELD: The vendors are liable to the plaintiff for breach of contract.
Each of the defendants is a tortfeasor, each having breached an obligation or duty owed to the plaintiff, whether through negligence or misrepresentation.
Their wrongful acts and omissions all contributed to the same damage.
In that respect their liability is concurrent.
The liability of the vendors and Mr. Jacobucci is joint, and that of Ms. Mui is several.
As concurrent torfeasors, the fault for the damage shall be apportioned equally among the four of them.
 1) Credibility is not a science, see R. v. Gagnon, 2006 SCC 17.
It is not always possible to articulate with precision the complex intermingling of impressions that emerge after watching and listening to witnesses and attempting to reconcile the various versions of events.
The principles and tools to be used in assessing credibility are summarized in Novak Estate (Re), 2008 NSSC 283.
2) Certain of the evidence of the Karpinskis and Ms. Mui is so unreliable that the whole of their evidence is cast with doubt.
3) The opinions and conclusions of Mr. Loraas and Mr. Epp are accepted by the court.
They are professionals with no interest in the outcome of the action.
Their evidence was largely unchallenged.
The Court finds that the pine shakes were rotten, sealant had been applied to the shakes on at least two occasions and prior to the plaintiff offering to buy the property, the shakes were not properly installed allowing water to seep into the house, the skylight leaked and caulking had been applied to stop the leaking before the plaintiff offered to buy the house, there was improper and inadequate venting which resulted in moisture damage to the interior of the house and mold in the attic, the moisture damage in the house included damage to drywall and paint blisters.
Nail pops throughout the house were largely the result of the house being moved.
No inspection was done after the house was moved.
4) The Court finds the Karpinskis did not speak truthfully or completely when they answered the questions in the Property Condition Disclosure Statement (PCDS).
The Court does not accept that the vendors were not aware of water and moisture damage arising from the improperly installed shingles, the missing ridge caps, the leaking skylight or the lack of venting.
The sealant on the roof was sufficiently old to predate the plaintiff's purchase of the house.
The vendors repaired the sink holes and moisture pockets and effectively concealed the problems.
It should have been disclosed.
Although the vendors denied knowing of the structural damage to their house, they knew the house had been cut in half and moved 300 kilometers and had sustained damage.
The structural problems were concealed by the vendors through repairs to the dry wall, reinforcement at stress points, and repainting and patching of wall paper.
The fact that the house had been cut in half and moved should have been disclosed on the PCDS. 5)
It is not only current defects or ongoing problems that need to be disclosed on a PCDS.
A prospective purchaser does not look to the PCDS only to ascertain that the roof is not leaking on the day it was signed, see Kaufmann v. Gibson, [2007]
O.J. No. 2711 (Ont. S.C.) (QL).
The Karpinskis are liable to the plaintiff for breach of contract for failing to disclose the existence of structural defects, damage due to water and roof leakage.
The terms of the PCDS formed part of the agreement between the parties and the deliberate withholding of this information amounted to a false representation as to the condition of the home.
With respect to damage arising from these defects, the doctrine of caveat emptor does not apply.
6) The requirements for negligent misrepresentation have been established by the plaintiff.
The failure to disclose, or silence as to a known defect, amounts to an act of concealment of a material fact and has the same effect as an express misrepresentation and is sufficient to attract liability, Thomas v. Blackwell, 1999 SKQB 168.
7) The false representations knowingly made by the vendors and their silence as to material facts were fraudulent.
8) Ms. Mui was negligent and her conduct and advice to the plaintiff fell below the standard of care expected of a realtor acting for the purchaser of a rural property in 1999.
She did not conduct any preliminary background checks with the Rural Municipality, which would include determining if proper permits had been obtained, prior to the plaintiff's offer to purchase.
Ms. Mui did nothing more than merely mention a home inspection to the plaintiff on one occasion.
At no time did she recommend a home inspection even after she knew the house had been moved and before the condition regarding a satisfactory PCDS was removed.
Another reason to strongly recommend a home inspection would be in circumstances where the realtor knew that a rural municipality did not require building inspections and Ms. Mui knew this to be the case.
The plaintiff relied on the representation of Ms. Mui to her detriment.
Had Ms. Mui disclosed all material facts to the plaintiff and explained and recommended a home inspection, the Court is satisfied that the outcome for the plaintiff would have been different.
Knowing the house had been moved and had not been inspected the plaintiff would have most likely reconsidered her decision to purchase.
9) The Court is satisfied that Mr. Jacabucci is liable to the plaintiff for negligent misrepresentation.
He represented that the home was of 'quality construction'.
This was incorrect.
Mr. Jacobucci was also complicit in, and party to, the negligent misrepresentations made by the vendors in the PCDS.
He knew the house had been moved and sustained damage.
He also knew the skylight leaked.
The plaintiff relied on these misrepresentations and damages resulted.
 10) The costs incurred by the plaintiff to repair the house total $17,613.
She is awarded $15,000 as compensation for personal time and effort that she expended in repairing the home.
There is no evidence that the distress the plaintiff experienced constituted a physical injury, or a recognized psychiatric illness and she cannot be compensated for mental distress, whether under tort or breach of contract.
She is awarded $10,000 for aggravated damages.
Her claim for punitive damages is dismissed.
Her claim for solicitor and client costs is dismissed.

Crugnale-Reid for the applicant (petitioner)Margot A. Dynna for the respondentJUDGMENT MALONE J. September 19, 1997The only issue to be determined in this application is the amount of monthly maintenance to be paid by the respondent to the applicant as support for their child who was born on September 30, 1986.
Both parties are medical practitioners and each enjoys a significant income.
The average income of the respondent over the past three years was approximately $180,000.00.
In 1996, the applicant earned approximately $128,000.00, although she claims this was extra- ordinary because she received payment for projects completed during the previous two years.
In addition to regular maintenance the applicant claims pursuant to s. 7 of the Divorce Act Regulations, SOR/97-175 (the ""Federal Child Support Guidelines""), additional maintenance to cover special or extra-ordinary expenses.
These expenses are approximately $1,200.00 per month to cover nanny and child care costs, approximately $125.00 per month for medication, $250.00 per month for recreation and $200.00 per month for a university fund for the child.
In the present circumstances s. 4 of the guidelines is applicable and it provides as follows:4.","The corporate defendant moved (under Rule 44.10 of the 2008 Rules) for an order terminating an attachment order made against it, and under Rule 32.02(3) to change the venue from Halifax to Windsor.
The latter was not opposed.
There was also an issue regarding an affidavit filed by the respondent, which referenced but did not attach the applicant's defence.
The respondent argued it was unnecessary to attach a document already filed with the court.
Change of venue granted in part: the applications will continue to be heard in Halifax, but the trial will be held in Windsor as requested.
Neither party has a connection to Halifax.
The respondent operates from Stewiacke and the dispute arose in Hants County.
The attachment order is terminated, with costs of $1,000 to the applicant.
An attachment order is an intrusive pre-trial remedy and will hinder the corporate applicant's attempts to resume/expand operations.
Here there is no conduct to justify maintaining the order.
The mere allegation of a connection between the individual and corporate defendants is insufficient to cause the court to pierce the corporate veil.
The respondent has failed to establish any of the relevant grounds governing attachment orders.
The Rules require facts, not allegations or suspicions.
The affidavit in question was flawed.

They married February 23, 1990 and separated October 5, 1994.
They have no children.
At the time of separation the wife was unemployed and completely dependent upon the husband.

Unfortunately, one year later, she is still unemployed.
She has no income and is still completely dependent upon the support paid by her husband.
She has some health problems but no medical evidence was offered suggesting her health prevents her working.
She has a B.Sc.

I can only conclude that her chosen field offers little job opportunity.
The wife's counsel contends that his client has been disadvantaged by the marriage breakdown.
While that disadvantage has been redressed temporarily by the interim order for support, he argues that she needs more time to make the transition from a state of dependency to one of self-sufficiency.
The husband takes the position that his obligation to support the wife should end.
He says she is capable of supporting herself and should have found a job by this time.
Alternatively, if she is not capable of working, her inability is not attributable to the marriage or its breakdown.

He elected to receive monthly payments for life with a guaranteed period of 15 years.","The two plaintiffs were forced to jump from the window of their third-floor apartment after a fire erupted in the building.
The fire alarm system was not functioning and, despite being aware of previous problems with the 25-year-old system, the defendant had never maintained or inspected it; the self-closing hallway fire doors were continually in an open position; the battery-operated fire alarm in the plaintiffs' apartment was not functioning; and the plaintiffs were unaware of whether their smoke detector was wired into the building or was their responsibility.
The male plaintiff suffered serious fractures to both ankles and a fractured fibula.
He underwent four surgeries, was non-weight bearing for three months and was unable to run or engage in various sports.
Although he had returned to work as a production worker, his condition would continue to deteriorate due to post-traumatic arthritis, most likely resulting in a future ankle fusion.
The female plaintiff suffered a pelvic ring injury with bilateral pelvic and sacral fractures, a fractured elbow and a broken rib.
She underwent surgery on her pelvis, was unable to look after her own hygiene for five months and developed bursitis in the hip.
She continued to experience pain in the tailbone with extensive sitting and in the elbow with extension of the arm, had a permanent loss of elbow extension and walked with a limp.
The worsening of her pre-existing anxiety and depression led to the diagnosis of post-traumatic stress disorder.
The landlord argued that the plaintiffs' injuries had not been caused by any of its actions.
Male plaintiff awarded the sum of $75,000 for general damages, $15,000 for past and future loss of valuable services and $45,000 for loss of earning capacity; female plaintiff awarded the sum of $55,000 for general damages, $35,000 for past and future loss of valuable services and $75,000 for future loss of income.
Although there was no evidence that the defendant was responsible for the fire, its conduct created an unreasonable risk of harm in the event of a fire.
Without evidence as to how much time the plaintiffs would have had to escape down the stairwell or how long they would have had to wait for the fire department had the smoke or fire alarms activated, the 'material contribution' test was applied to the causation issue.
When the plaintiffs first awoke, the fire had already worked its way up through the attic hatch to the roof, where the flames in the eaves were visible to the plaintiffs.
Smoke and fire were able to flow freely through the adjacent stairwell as a result of the fire door being left open, and the failure of the smoke detectors and fire alarms allowed the smoke and fire to progress before being detected by the plaintiffs.
The female plaintiff was found to have no meaningful residual earning capacity due to the combination of her physical and psychological injuries.","[0, 1, 3, 4, 2, 7, 6, 5, 10, 9, 8]"
379,"for the respondent JUDGMENT SANDOMIRSKY, J.
May 10, 2013 THE CASE[1] Madison is four years old (d.o.b.
September 2, 2008).
Her parents, Kelly and Lisa, separated from one another on October 14, 2009.
By agreement, her parents have shared parenting on a two week cycle.
In the first week, Lisa parents Madison in her Moose Jaw home from Sunday at 7:00 p.m. until the following Wednesday at 7:00 p.m.
Each parent has an equal amount of parenting time.
The shared parenting regime has worked well while Madison was a pre-schooler.
However, this coming September Madison will be five years old and will commence school on a regular basis.
The inevitable decision as to where Madison will attend school, that is in Moose Jaw or Regina, is imminent.
THE EVIDENCEThe Petitioner’s Case[2] Kelly is 27 years old.
Lisa was pregnant with Madison at that point in time and delivered Madison on September 2, 2008.
Madison was and continues to be a healthy child.
Only her uncle had any criticism of Madison.
By all accounts, the child is normal and has been resilient in coping with her parent’s separation and conflict.
[3] Kelly and Lisa were divorced on November 26, 2012.","The tenants were given short written notice to vacate their apartment unit.
The tenants applied under the Residential Tenancies Act for the return of their security deposit and damages including moving expenses.
The landlord was out of country at the time of the hearing but authorized by letter that the caretaker would attend the hearing to represent the landlord.
The caretaker confirmed the tenants endured a protracted plumbing problem and restriction on bathroom use in the apartment.
The hearing officer awarded the tenants half of the actual moving cost and 1 year of rent abatement.
The landlord appealed the hearing officer's decision.
The landlord alleged that he was not given the opportunity to be heard or to adequately respond to the tenants' claim as he received inadequate notice and alleged that the award of damages was unreasonable.
HELD: The landlord's appeal was dismissed.
1) The tenant gave notice of his claim by two separate documents and the landlord showed no misapprehension of the tenants' position based on his written response.
The landlord did not indicate in his letter that the caretaker had a limited role and the landlord could have sought an adjournment but did not.
 2) Section 70(6)(c) of the Act empowers the hearing officer to order payment of damages where the hearing officer considers it just and equitable.
The wording of this provision is broad and unconstrained excepting that the nature of damages that may be imposed must not be punitive.
The decision on rent abatement was principled and to compensate the tenants for their loss of use of usable space.
The award for moving costs was intended to compensate for inconvenience, aggravation and related expenses.
The awards were reasonable both in fact and law and no reviewable error was made by the hearing officer.

The parties live blocks from each other, but the transition between homes has not gone well.
The children have been primarily residing with the father.
The father has been in three motor vehicle accidents within three years and is facing criminal charges as a result of the most recent one.
The father works long hours as a maintenance man.
The mother has four other children from previous relationships.
The children of the marriage indicate that they have some problems with one step brother, who lives in their mother's home.
The children's academic performance is not strong and the parents have made little effort to assist their children in pursuing an education.
One child has been non- compliant with his ADHD medication while in the father's care.
While the mother has a more stable residence, both parties have bounced from home to home.
The father has tended to abdicate parenting responsibilities to his relatives and has not used the mother as a caregiver of first resort.
The mother's relationship with her children has not been fostered in a meaningful way.
HELD: While there is no ideal solution, the Court ordered a shared parenting arrangement where the children would spend one week in each home when school started in the fall.
The parents were required to participate in mediation sessions which were to be paid for by the father.
Joint custody was ordered.
The father was ordered to pay child support in accordance with the Guidelines.","[2, 4, 6, 5, 3, 0, 7, 1, 10, 8]"

The plaintiff brought a negligence action against the defendant, stemming from a 2007 fire in premises that the defendant had rented from the plaintiff.
The plaintiff sought production of documents related to a 2009 fire at another location rented by the defendant.
The defendant resisted on the basis that the documents were not relevant.
Held, motion dismissed.
Under Rule 14.01, the motions judge must decide relevancy based on the pleadings and evidence produced on the motion as if the matter were raised at trial.
The party seeking production must establish relevance.
Here, the only evidence was regarding the occurrence of the fires; there was no evidence as to the manner of the defendant's operation of the business in the second location that would establish relevance to the action regarding the first location.
The commonality of a fire in separate buildings two years apart does not, by itself, justify disclosure of documents relating to the second fire.","[1, 8, 5, 16, 0, 10, 11, 6, 4, 22, 13, 7]"

The order provides for child support, payable to the petitioner mother on behalf of the two youngest children, Michael, born March 15, 1990, and Jessica, born December 30, 1991.

At the hearing, the parties agreed that it would be beneficial also to address the issue of any ongoing s. 7 expenses.
Residence of Michael[2] Jessica and Michael have lived with the mother since the parties divorced on February 21, 1998.
In June, 2006, however, Michael began living in Saskatoon in order to be eligible to play with a particular AAA baseball team.
To that end, his parents entered into a guardianship arrangement with his maternal aunt.
Although the agreement stipulated that he live with his aunt, in fact, Michael began living with his maternal grandmother on the west side of the city.
While there, his mother paid his grandmother $400.00 each month for room and board and she gave Michael an allowance.","The Crown applied for leave to appeal a Queen's Bench decision that set aside the convictions of the respondents, Chisum Log Homes and Lumber Ltd. and its sole director, Varga, for operating a forest products processing facility without a licence, contrary to s. 18.1 of The Forest Resources Management Act.
The charges had stemmed from the manufacture of log-home packages by the company under the direction of Varga.
The manufacture of these packages entailed the purchase of felled trees harvested by others from Crown lands.
The logs were then cut at the respondents' facility into various lengths and notched, marked for construction and assembled into log-home packages.
In the appeal to Queen's Bench of the convictions, the judge found that these steps in the manufacture of the packages did not engage the licencing provisions of the Act.
HELD: The Court gave leave to appeal and allowed the appeal.
Based on the definitions provided in s. 2 of the Act with respect to the words 'processing facility', 'forest products', and 'manufacture', it found that the operation of the facility by the company and Varga without a processing facility licence was unlawful as being contrary to s. 18.1.
As the Provincial Court judge's conclusion was correct, the Court held that the convictions must stand and did not interfere with the fines and surcharges imposed upon the respondents.","[1, 6, 3, 0, 4, 8, 7, 10, 5, 9, 11, 12]"

The parents separated in October of 2003.
They agreed to an order of joint custody with Keeler primarily residing with Charlene.
Charlene wishes to move with Keeler from Saskatoon to Edmonton and Harley is opposed to such a move.
ISSUES[2] The issues are as follows: 1.
Is it in the best interests of Keeler to relocate from Saskatoon to Edmonton, Alberta with Charlene?
2.
If it is in the best interests of Keeler to move to Edmonton, what is an appropriate access schedule for Harley to be with Keeler?
BACKGROUND[3] Charlene and Harley met in July of 2001.
When Charlene was nineteen years old and Harley twenty-seven they commenced living together at Harley’s home in September of 2001.
Charlene found out she was pregnant in October of 2001 and Keeler was born May 27, 2002.
Harley and Charlene separated in mid-October of 2003.
This order established Harley’s income at $20,965 and Charlene’s income at $7,258.","Criminal Law – Recognizance
The defendant was a repeat violent and sexual offender who was still serving a sentence for sexual assault and out on a weekend parole pass when he committed his last sexual assault offence against his 14-year-old niece.
He was returned to prison and served his entire sentence to warrant expiry before being placed on a s. 810.1 peace bond recognizance upon his release from prison in 2010 and then again in 2012.
The Crown then applied for a third recognizance.
An RCMP officer with the High Risk Offender/Serious Violent Offender Response Unit swore an Information that he had reasonable grounds to believe that the defendant would commit either a serious personal injury or a sexual assault offence against someone under the age of 16 years and requested that he be bound over.
A parole officer with Correctional Services Canada also testified to the defendant’s history in the federal prison and to her belief that based, upon his history, the defendant remained at high risk to re-offend.
The Crown indicated that it was looking for one recognizance, either under s. 810.2 or s. 810.1 of the Criminal Code.
The defendant had 59 prior criminal convictions, 12 of which related to sexual or common assaults.
He had a serious alcohol abuse problem and committed most of the assaults while intoxicated.
While in prison, he had refused to participate in programming.
As a high risk to re-offend for sexual offending, the defendant was required to complete high-intensity sex offender programming but had not availed himself of the opportunity to do so during the last four years.
HELD: The Court granted the recognizance to bind the defendant over to keep the peace and be of good behaviour pursuant to s. 810.2 of the Code because it agreed with the beliefs and opinions expressed by the witnesses and their evidence that they believed that he would re-offend in a violent or sexual manner, which posed an imminent danger to public safety.","[0, 1, 2, 5, 4, 10, 8, 7, 12, 11, 9, 14, 16, 13, 17, 3, 15, 20]"

When Elmer Schmidt, who was travelling west on Highway 306 near Grey, Saskatchewan, saw a car driven by Margaret Henry approach from his right, stop at the stop sign, and then proceed forward toward the highway, he applied his brakes with such force that his truck entered a skid, left the highway, and struck the side of the car.
The damages to both the truck and the car exceeded the $500.00 insurance deductible.
Consequently, Schmidt brings this action against the car's owner, Vernon Henry, and Margaret Henry for his $500.00 deductible, and the Henrys counterclaim for the same.
2.
The situation at this intersection is somewhat unusual, in that the stop sign is 39 feet back from the edge of the pavement, which itself approximately two feet from the driving portion of the highway.
Henry complied with the requirement to stop.
However, The Highway Traffic Act places an additional duty upon such drivers.
3.
Those subsections have been interpreted to mean, sensibly, that the driver must not only stop, but yield to oncoming traffic.","Family Law – Spousal Support – RetroactiveThe petitioner commenced a family law proceeding requesting divorce and equal division of family property in 2010.
She did not seek spousal support as part of her original application to the Court.
In August of 2013, the petitioner sought to amend her petition to include a claim for spousal support based on the Spousal Support Advisory Guidelines.
In January of 2014, the petitioner filed an application for interim spousal support retroactive to the date of separation.
HELD: The petitioner was awarded spousal support, but the award was not retroactive to the date of separation.
The petitioner was entitled to spousal support from the date that she put the respondent on notice of her application for spousal support.
The respondent, at age 61, should not be forced to work overtime in order to meet his spousal support obligations.

The petitioner requests that the parenting judgment be varied to provide a four day on and four day off rotation to the parenting schedule and the deletion from paragraph 2 of the parenting judgment the respondent’s final decision making provision.
The petitioner, as well, seeks several additional adjustments to the initial parenting judgment.
In regard to the child support order, the petitioner seeks that the child support order be varied to provide that his $762 per month payment that he currently makes not be increased or decreased in the years to come.

After the death of the testator, one of his five daughters brought an application for an order directing a trial to prove the testator’s 2013 will in solemn form on the ground that the testator did not have testamentary capacity to understand the nature of the document he was signing or the extent of his property.
The testator and his wife had executed mirror wills in 2012.
His wife died in September 2013, and within two days of her death the testator had signed a new will.
It was based on his first will with some revisions.
The value of the estate was approximately $343,000 and the will made bequests of $100 to the applicant and another daughter.
The testator left the rest and residue of the estate divided into equal shares between his three other daughters.
The applicant deposed that at the time the testator’s wife was dying, she visited him and found him to be very confused.
When the testator’s lawyer came to meet with him as his wife was dying, the applicant stated that the testator said he did not remember the lawyer and would not sign anything.
The only other evidence submitted by the applicant was a letter from the testator’s physician, who reported that he saw the testator in early September 2012 and that he was then alert and could recognize him.
The evidence presented by the two daughters who were named as executors of the will consisted of their own affidavits and the affidavits of a friend of the testator; a bank official who had prepared a power of attorney for the testator made at the time of the death of his wife; and the lawyer who prepared the original 2012 wills and the 2013 will.
The contents of the various affidavits deposed to the testator’s estranged relationship with the applicant and her sister, his intention to exclude the applicant from his will, and that he appeared to be mentally capable.
The lawyer’s affidavit deposed that at the initial meeting that she attended with the testator when his wife was dying, he was devastated by grief and she did not take any instructions.
When she met with him again to take instructions regarding his new will, she kept notes of them—the testator had expressly instructed her to make sure that the two daughters would get nothing except for the specific bequests.
The lawyer confirmed that she had no concerns with the testator’s capacity.
HELD: The application was dismissed.
The court held that the applicant’s evidence in support of the challenge to the will was extremely thin and the descriptions of the testator’s behaviour did not raise doubt regarding his capacity regarding his property and his disposition of it.
The other affidavits presented uncontradicted evidence of the testator’s undiminished mental capacity.","[5, 3, 1, 7, 0, 8, 4, 6, 2]"

The testator died in January 2015 and application for probate had not yet been made.

PROCEDURAL HISTORY[3] June 20, 2008 Justice D.L.
Wilson made a series of orders in relation to the parties’ children.
The relevant portion of the order in relation to Amanda is the following:1.
(b) The child, Amanda Nygren, born May 29, 1989, ceased to be a child within the meaning of the Divorce Act commencing and including July 1, 2007.
There shall be no child support payable with respect to this child commencing and including July 1, 2007.

1985, c. 3 (2nd Supp.)
and an order requiring ongoing and retroactive payments by Mr. Johnson for some of Amanda Nygren’s extraordinary expenses for post-secondary education.

Her order provides as follows:1.
2.","Statutes – Interpretation – Limitation of Civil Rights Act, Section 2The appellants had granted a residential mortgage in favour of the respondent that secured a loan in the amount of $460,800.
The loan was a consolidation of existing debt, part of which was the balance of $373,089 owed on the original loan that had enabled the appellants to purchase the land.
The remaining $87,711 was non-purchase money financing approved by the respondent.
The appellants fell into default, and the respondent commenced foreclosure proceedings when the balance owed had increased to $536,186.
The property was sold through judicial listing orders and the net sale proceeds were paid to the respondent.
As the proceeds were insufficient, the respondent sought an order entitling it to the deficiency.
The Chambers judge considered s. 2 of The Limitation of Civil Rights Act (LCRA) and held that the amount of the deficiency should be $162,675.99.
The issues on appeal were how the proceeds of sale should be applied against the mortgage balance and what the proper amount of the deficiency was.
HELD: The appeal was allowed.
The court reviewed the purpose and policy behind the LCRA.
It then examined its conflicting decisions in Hrynewich Holdings and Andrews and held that the latter was a per incuriam judgment and therefore not binding and the approach set out in Hrynewich would guide the disposition of this appeal.
Therefore, it found with respect to each issue that the holding in Hrynewich meant that payments should be allocated on a pro-rated basis to purchase money and non-purchase money debt balances and the proper amount of the deficiency to which the respondent was entitled to judgment against the appellants was $31,160.23.","[5, 4, 2, 8, 3, 7, 0, 12, 6, 15, 10, 11, 14, 17, 13]"

INTRODUCTION[1] This is a high-conflict family law matter.
The mother wants to change her residence (and that of the two young children) presently, which amounts to an application to change residence on an interim basis.
The father has a significant history of criminal behaviour, is presently incarcerated and will be for at least the balance of this calendar year.
He opposes the move, and in any event wants access.
The parties have come to this court to determine what should happen on an interim basis.
II.
FACTS[2] The parties married October 11, 2008, and separated in April 2011.
It was the first marriage for each.
[3] There is little utility in reviewing the events within the marriage in exhaustive detail.
Suffice it to say that from the outset, the marriage was tempestuous.
Within months of the marriage the father was charged criminally and served time in jail.
When this action was commenced in spring 2011, the mother had to obtain an ex parte order returning the boys to her care.
The father has issues with substance abuse and anger management.
Unfortunately, for a variety of reasons this report was not completed until February 2013.","Where the petitioner demonstrated that she did not upgrade her education during the marriage as a result of her attempts to become pregnant and thus there was a causal connection between the petitioner's need and the marriage,
interim maintenance in the amount of $100 per month was ordered

May 21, 1999[1] The petitioner obtained an ex parte order under s. 8(1) of The Family Maintenance Act, 1997, S.S. 1997, c. F-6.2 (the “Act”) which:(a) restrains the Attorney General of Canada from releasing or paying any monies to the respondent or his solicitors, MacPherson, Leslie & Tyerman (“MLT”), in relation to the respondent’s claim in Queen’s Bench Action No.

[2] By notice of motion, the petitioner has applied to have the ex parte order set aside insofar as it applies to the Attorney General of Canada but seeks to continue the restraining order against the respondent and his solicitors, MLT.
Both parties agree that the provision in the ex parte order referred to in (c) above is not required and should terminate.","A 19 year old motorcyclist collided with a dump truck and suffered a dislocated hip, knee injuries and a minor hand injury.

for the Betty Eileen Donald M. Dean Brown for the George Edwin BrownJUDGMENT GUNN J. October 24, 2005[1] There are two applications before the Court.
Betty Donald seeks an order varying the support order granted by Archambault, J. on September 11, 1998.
[2] At the commencement of the hearing Ms. Donald abandoned any claims for retroactive support and retroactive s. 7 expenses.
She now seeks an order for ongoing child maintenance, based on the Federal Child Support Guidelines (SOR/97‑175, as am.)
(the “Guidelines”) commencing September 1, 2005 payable to and including March 1, 2006.
She further seeks an order pursuant to s. 7 of the Guidelines for some contribution to Warren’s post-secondary expenses commencing September 1, 2005.
[3] Mr. Brown seeks an order that his child support obligations for Warren cease effective July 2004, and that he be reimbursed for any payments made subsequent to that date.
In the event any ongoing payments are ordered, Mr. Brown submits his income should be found to be $16,049.73 as that is his most recent income.","The trial judge's decision fixing a retroactive effective date for child support was also upheld as there was no error on the part of the trial judge in fixing the date.,the Appeal Division upheld the trial judge's decision which did not include in the division of matrimonial assets a bank account held in the wife's name alone where the uncontradicted evidence of the wife was that the spouses had agreed when the wife went back into the work force that anything she earned would be hers.

The parties signed a separation agreement and interspousal contract on July 16, 2004.
With respect to spousal support the agreement provides that it is the intention of the parties that spousal support will be based on a division of income until July 1, 2011.
[2] The respondent worked as a computer consultant.
He carried on business through a corporation, Exodus Technologies Inc.
The sole source of revenue of the corporation was revenue earned by the respondent’s efforts as a computer consultant.
The actual amount of the expenses may be somewhat more or somewhat less than the actual amount of $35,000.00.
7.3 Paul shall receive all of the net income and shall pay one half of the net income to Brenda by way of equal monthly payments of spousal support.
The amount of payment shall be adjusted yearly to reflect the changing income of the company after each year end.
Any overpayment or under payment shall be made up over a period of the next 12 months.
The adjustment shall take place on April 1 each year.
The amount payable shall be reduced in an amount equal to 40% of Brenda’s income that she has earned.","Appeal from an order aside, as premature, an order of the Labour Relations Board directing that a vote be held to determine which of two unions should represent the employees of the Health Centre.

HELD: It is within the purview of the Board to interpret s.37 and on an application to quash, the first question to be asked by the reviewing court is whether the interpretation is patently unreasonable.
To jump immediately to an analysis of the facts premised on a different interpretation does not serve.
The interpretation of the board of s.37 was not patently unreasonable.
It does not apply to other areas of the law, such as financing, conveyance of property or insurance, where a more precise and predictable delineation may be appropriate.
The Board is interpreting s.37 for the purposes of labour law alone.

The deceased made a will and codicil on November 23, 1989 and December 11, 1989 respectively.
Neither makes any provision for the younger child.
The sole beneficiary of the Estate is the elder son, Evan.
The executors are directed to hold the farmlands and improvements in trust for Evan until he attains the age of twenty-one years when they will be conveyed to him absolutely.
They are directed to hold the deceased's personal effects, other than motor or non-motorized vehicles and to convey the same to Evan upon his attaining the age of eighteen years.
The residue is subject to sale in the Executor's absolute discretion with the like discretion to apply the net income and to encroach on capital for the maintenance of the child, until he reaches twenty-one years of age.
The codicil directs the Executors to rent the farmlands, with the deceased's brother, Bruce Ulmer having the first option to lease.
Pursuant to an Order of February 25, 1991 granting corollary relief in divorce proceedings, the deceased was, in his lifetime, paying child support in the amount of $150.00 per month per child.","The wife petitioned and the husband counter-petitioned for a division of matrimonial property, custody, access and spousal and child support.

Watson for the petitionerD.Z.
Braun for the respondentJUDGMENT DICKSON J.December 9, 1998[1] The petitioner (mother) seeks retroactive child and spousal support.
Her application is rather unusual because no children are presently dependent upon her and by her own admission she is self-sufficient.
Nevertheless, she claims her former husband did not pay sufficient support when both she and the children were dependent upon him and now wants a catch- up payment of $47,367.
[2] The parties were married in 1963.
The mother was 16 years old and unemployed.
The father was a 21-year-old seasonal worker in the construction trade.
Their marriage followed the traditional pattern of father as breadwinner and mother as homemaker.
They both took a hotel management course in 1967, hoping to work in that industry.
The father experienced periodic unemployment thereafter and to make ends meet the mother was forced to take low-paying jobs outside the home.
The father then went to Edmonton to look for work while the mother and children remained in Saskatoon.","After a series of pre-trial conferences, and the exchange of some correspondence between the parties lawyers, the husband took the position that the parties had reached a binding agreement as to the value of his pension.
The wife disagreed and a trial of this issue was directed and determined in the husband's favour.
The wife appealed.
HELD: Appeal allowed.
 1)Since the judgment of this Court in Childs v. Childs Estate, [1988]
1 W.W.R. 746, there is no doubt that a judge has the power, under Rule 7 of s. 44 of The Queen's Bench Act, R.S.S. 1978, c. Q-1, to enforce or set aside an agreement compromising an action by summary proceedings.
The law as stated in that judgment applies as well to agreements or settlements reached during the course of pre-trial conferences.
2)Parties will not usually intend to settle selected issues on a piecemeal basis, but rather will reach tentative agreements on selected issues conditional on an overall settlement agreement being concluded.
Such was the parties' intention in this case, and accordingly, there was no settlement contract for the judge in the court below to enforce.
 3)This is not to say that parties cannot reach several separate independent, binding and enforceable agreements as part of an effort to reach an overall settlement of the matters in issue between them, but in order to do so, the intention of the parties to settle on a piecemeal or installment basis must be clear.
Nothing in the evidence indicated such an intention in this case. 4)In cases of settlement agreements reached at a pre- trial conference, the application to enforce, or to set aside, should be made under Rule 7 of s. 44 of The Queen's Bench Act as was done in Childs and not under Rule 184A as was the developing practice.","[0, 1, 2, 4, 6, 8, 9, 7, 5, 3, 10, 11, 13, 12, 15]"

The parties were married November 11, 1961.
The parties separated June 27, 1994, but the husband actually left the residence some time later.
Margaret had a grade 8 education and part of grade 9.
She was then employed briefly in Yorkton, but at the time of the marriage she was helping her parents on the farm and had no outside employment.
Ron was employed at the Theodore Credit Union as an assistant manager or the equivalent.

For a short time during the marriage, Margaret was employed in a sales position in Yorkton, but was dismissed.

This medical evidence would have to be repeated to establish the Plaintiff's damages if the issues were severed and liability was found.

Purchase price for the Spreader was $37,000.00, the balance of which was paid in full, upon delivery.
Delivery was made on or about April 1, 2000.
The defendant, Meyer Mfg.
Corp. (“Meyer”) manufactured the Spreader.
They did not defend the action and were noted for default of defence on August 31, 2001.
It was agreed that the present proceeding would determine issues between the plaintiff and the defendant Apollo only.
[3] There was no communication between the parties from the delivery date until sometime in late July or early August, 2000.
According to Mr. Cowan, the Spreader sat idol until August.
This breakdown prompted a series of telephone calls between the plaintiff and representatives of both defendants.
The chain was repaired by the plaintiff, but it broke again shortly after the Spreader was returned to service.
He described the subsequent events in his affidavit as follows:6. .","An application for an interim injunction restraining the Regina Exhibition Association (REAL) from interfering with GCB's enjoyment of certain leasehold premises in the Jubilee Building and from entering into any lease with Regina Central Bingo (RCBA) and preventing the operation of a bingo hall by RCBA within Exhibition Park except as sub-tenant of GCB.
The original five year lease for use of the Jubilee Building as a bingo hall between Fundraising td. and REAL was assigned to GCB with REAL's written consent.
GCB further sublet the building without REAL's consent or knowledge.
Written notice of renewal was not sent to REAL.
The basis of GCB's application was estoppel on the basis that REAL entered negotiations regarding a relocation of the bingo hall and then began to deal directly with CGB's sub-tenant after the renewal date had passed.
HELD: The application was dismissed.
Costs in the cause.
1)There was no evidence that Fundraisers, the original party to the lease, attempted to exercise the option to renew.
2)GCB did not have a strong prima facie case on the merits.
It appeared that there were no negotiations between GCB and REAL.
3)There would not be irreparable harm.
Under the current arrangements, the bingo would be operated by RCBA.
If successful at trial the damages to GCB can be easily calculated based on the time it was unable to occupy the premises.
4)On balance GCB failed to satisfy the burden of proof that the inconvenience it will suffer by the refusal of the injunction will be greater than that suffered by REAL if granted.","[0, 1, 2, 5, 4, 6, 8, 7, 11, 12, 13, 15, 10, 18, 14, 19, 21, 3, 25, 23]"

March 13, 2000[1] In 1994 the plaintiff engaged the defendant, D & S Homes Ltd., to construct a residence.
It is alleged that the defendant failed to perform as agreed and in consequence the plaintiff seeks damages.
The defendant resists the claim and by way of a counterclaim seeks judgment for extras requested by the plaintiff.
I have concluded that there is merit to both the claim and the counterclaim and after implementing a set-off, judgment should be granted to the plaintiff, but for a much lesser sum than claimed.
The Background Facts[2] Late in 1993 the plaintiff was interested in having a quality home built for himself.
At the time the plaintiff was 24 years of age and had no knowledge or experience in the area of home construction.
He was well able to deal with Slater and events as they came to pass.
This was done and the blueprints were completed in March, 1994.
The plaintiff and Slater then entered into discussions about the specifications and ultimately agreed upon them.
Within the document there is this provision.","The respondent applied to reduce on-going maintenance from $600 per month for his two children and to reduce the accumulated arrears of approximately $14,600.
The original corollary relief was made in 1989.
An application for variation was dismissed in 1993 except that an order suspending the enforcement of the arrears during the times the respondent was unemployed was granted.
The petitioner who had custody of the children and resided in Manitoba was employed.
She requested that the matter be dealt with summarily on affidavit evidence and did not want a trial of the issue.
HELD: The respondent was to pay $300 per month per child in the months when his gross earnings are $2,200 or greater and $150 per month per child when they are less.
Arrears were reduced by $7,000.
When he earned more than $2,200 per month he was to pay $200 per month on arrears in addition to the on-going child support obligation.
The 1993 order was continued and it was further ordered that the respondent file quarterly a financial statement or cheque stubs evidencing his income with the maintenance enforcement office.
1)There was a significant reduction in the respondent's income since 1994, therefore there was a material change in circumstances.
2)The respondent had not provided specific information about the number of months he was in receipt of social assistance.
It was clear, however, that his income during 1995 and 1996 did not allow him to meet his support obligations.
Since his employment was uncertain a flexible order was appropriate.","[0, 1, 4, 2, 7, 5, 8, 10, 6, 12, 9, 16, 17, 22, 14]"

PLAINTIFF - and -TIM SULLIVAN, SULLIVAN INSTRUMENTATION INC. and POTASH CORPORATION OF SASKATCHEWAN INC.
I[3] PCS entered into a contract with the plaintiff on February 16, 2005 for a term of two months.
The plaintiff was to supply two instrument technicians to perform electrical instrumentation work at the mine.
The contract was extended by PCS in mid April and then again in June until the end of September, 2005.
[4] The plaintiff alleges that the contract was extended for a further three months from September 30 until the end of December 2005.
PCS disputes that claim.
[5] Sullivan worked for the plaintiff at the Saskferco plant at Belle Plaine from August 2003 until February 2005 at which time he agreed to work for the plaintiff at the PCS mine.
[6] Kusniak disagrees with that but I prefer Sullivan’s account of the meeting.
[7] In addition to Sullivan the plaintiff hired Compton Bird (“Bird”), an apprentice instrumentation mechanic to work at the mine site.
He also knew that Sullivan was leaving employment with the plaintiff.
PCS had, on its permanent staff, individuals to do the type of work which was being done by the plaintiff.","An application pursuant to s232(4)(c) of the Income Tax Act for a determination of whether the applicants have solicitor-client privilege in respect of 25 documents for which Revenue Canada had sought disclosure.
The applicants were husband and wife, their two sons and the companies in which they were principal shareholders and/or directors.
The documents related to three separate occasions upon which the applicants sought the advice or assistance of a lawyer in relation to proposed transactions.
The documents in issue were originally in the possession of their accounting firm.
At issue was the extent to which solicitor-client privilege could be asserted in relation to communications with and documents prepared by third parties.
HELD: 1)The privilege claimed in relation to all of the documents relating to the legal advice sought after January 1995 was upheld.
2)The claim was not upheld for copies of a letter setting out the proposal for the 1988 transaction.
One letter appeared to be advice offered by the accountants to the applicants.
 3)The applicants abandoned their claim for privilege with respect to handwritten notes summarizing share value and fair market value of assets which had been prepared by the accountants other than for the purpose of obtaining legal advice.
The claim of privilege was abandoned for a declaration of gift and minutes of a director's meeting in 1991. 4)It has been clearly established in case law that even though a client may look to his/her accountant rather than a solicitor for advice in relation to the law of taxation, the applicants must show the documents were protected by solicitor-client privilege and not merely accountant-client privilege. 5)Although solicitor-client privilege is defined in s232(1)(e) of the ITA, the issue had to be resolved in light of the common law test for privilege. 6)Privilege may extend to accountant communications where the accountant is acting as agent or representative of the client for the purpose of seeking legal advice from a solicitor.
Recent cases appear to diverge on the question of the circumstances necessary to found the requisite relationship of agency.
7)The accountants were clearly acting as agents for the applicants for the purpose of obtaining legal advice, as was found in Susan Hosiery.
They were at all times acting in a confidential capacity on behalf of and on instructions of the applicants.
8)Solicitor-client privilege extended to items of accounting information obtained for the purpose of receiving legal advice.
Notes prepared by the accountant and the interoffice communications summarizing discussions with the solicitor also fell within the scope of privilege.","[5, 8, 1, 2, 0, 6, 9, 13, 7, 19, 10, 21, 14]"

Smith for the defendantsJUDGMENT FOLEY J.September 19, 2003[1] William Mayer (Mayer) died on June 16, 1997.
His will directed that the residue of his estate be divided between two of his three children, namely, his son Garry Mayer, the plaintiff in this action and his daughter, Cheryl Pokol.
One of the estate assets was a Trimark mutual fund which Mayer had purchased in November 1996 for $60,000.
In June 1997 its value was $68,501.10 which was eventually distributed to the two beneficiaries.
[2] Garry Mayer by this action claims that the mutual fund ought never to have formed part of his father’s estate.
Each party gave notice of intention to cross-examine on the affidavits.
[4] The facts arising from the affidavits and cross-examinations which are not in dispute are:1.
The defendant, Nordstrom, is a chartered life underwriter and financial consultant who sells life and investment products through Canada Life Assurance Company and Dataplan Securities Ltd.
He and Mayer had a business relationship from 1981 to 1987 during which time Mayer purchased life insurance and made investments.

All of the elements of Ms. Smid's claim have been resolved with the exception as to whether Ms. Smid's injuries were caused by Mr. Rooke's negligence.
The parties propose to resolve the issue of causation by having this Court answer the following question:Did the motor vehicle accident cause or contribute to any of the plaintiff's injuries or damage?
Her claim arises out of a motor vehicle collision that occurred on a public thoroughfare within the City of Saskatoon on February 4, 1991 (hereinafter called the ""collision"").
Ms. Smid suffers from a chronic condition which makes it uncomfortable for her to distribute her upper body weight equally between her left and right buttock while seated in a motor vehicle.
To avoid discomfort, she turns her body slightly to the left in order to place a disproportionate amount of her body weight on her left thigh and left buttock.
At the time of the collision she was sitting in such a position in the driver's seat of her vehicle and had both hands on the steering wheel.
Within hours following the collision, Ms. Smid experienced back pain for which she sought immediate medical treatment.
She continued to experience pain and discomfort for a protracted period and consulted numerous medical practitioners for treatment of her problems.","Associates, which held purchase money security interests pursuant to its 1997 leases, applied under s.63 of the Personal Property Security Act for an order declaring the priority of competing security interests held by Associates and Humboldt Flour Mills in two reefer trailers.
Humboldt's security interests were acquired pursuant to a security agreement granted in 1996 on present and after acquired property as amended in 1998 to specifically include the trailers.
It also applied for an order giving directions respecting the exercise of the rights of the secured party with the prior interest.
At issue is what is meant by 'possession' in s.34(2)(a) and when Lake Air obtained possession or constructive possession of the trailers.
HELD: The application was allowed with costs from Humboldt.
 1)The parties filed an agreed statement of facts and focused on the priority issue as if the application had been brought under s.66. 2)'Constructive possession' means possession of the collateral by 'another person at the request of the debtor' as set out in s.34(2)(a).
What constitutes 'possession' of collateral by the debtor within s.34(2)(a) was in dispute.
Unless the property qualifies as 'collateral' a person cannot possess it as a 'debtor' within the meaning of the priority section. 3)The case law in Saskatchewan has interpreted 'possession' to constitute more than mere physical possession.
Sections 22 and 34(2) of the new Act are essentially unchanged except for the addition of the constructive possession.
S.22(2) restricts the scope of constructive possession somewhat but it applies only to s.22 not to s.34.
4)A person is not in constructive possession of collateral within s.34(2)(a) unless that person is a 'debtor' as defined, unless the collateral is 'collateral' as defined and unless another person 'obtained physical possession of the colateral at the request of that debtor'.
5)The first term of each lease agreement contained an acknowledgement by Lake Air that the trailer was delivered by Associates at the date and location set out in the lease.
Such a clause is inconsistent with Lake Air having actual or constructive possession at an earlier date.
Lake Air did not have constructive possession prior to December 1997 through either Bell or Mid-Canada.
Neither was in possession of the trailers at the request of Lake Air.
 6)The protection the Act gives to purchase-money security holders should be interpreted broadly.
To deny Associates priority over Humboldt would provide Humboldt with an unmerited windfall at the sole expense of Associates who gave full value for the purchase-money security interest it obtained from Lake Air.","[3, 1, 0, 9, 11, 4, 10, 12, 13, 6]"

for the applicant plaintiffD.C. Hodson for the respondent defendantsJUDGMENT FOLEY J.December 12, 2003[1] The applicant Danka Canada Inc. (Danka) seeks interlocutory injunctive relief framed in argument as follows:i) An interlocutory injunction until trial of this action restraining the Defendants, Ritchie Gifford, Clifford Kohuch, Kenneth Speed and Allan Currie from breaching the terms of their respective restrictive covenants in favour of Danka by taking employment with Brennan Educational Supply Ltd. in any position that involves the sales or service of photocopiers, printers, facsimile machines or related multi-function machines;ii) An interlocutory injunction restraining the Defendant Employees from competing, directly or indirectly, with Danka Canada Inc. until after their respective contracts of employment with Danka Canada Inc. have been terminated by the giving and expiry of a reasonable period of notice to quit;iii) An interlocutory injunction until trial of this action restraining the Defendant Employees or any individual who were employees of Danka Canada Inc. and who are hired by Brennan Office Plus or Brennan Educational Supply Ltd. after the date of this Court’s order from soliciting, directly or indirectly, the customers of Danka Canada Inc. and from performing any service work to equipment that was sold or leased by Danka Canada Inc.;iv) An interlocutory injunction until trial of this action restraining the Defendants, Garry Huntington, Robert Brennan and Brennan Educational Supply Ltd., from soliciting, directly or indirectly, the employees of Danka Canada Inc., from soliciting, directly or indirectly the customers of Danka Canada Inc. in respect of the sale or lease of photocopiers, printers, facsimile machines or related multi-function machines and from performing any service work for customers of Danka Canada Inc. in respect of any machines that were sold or leased to the user by Danka Canada Inc.[2] The relief so claimed has undergone modification from that asserted in the amended statement of claim as well as from that sought in the notice of motion.
This is neither surprising nor unusual given the time constraints placed on applicants seeking such relief and the factual nature of the circumstances.
[3] By a fiat of December 5, 2003, the application by Danka for interlocutory injunctive relief was dismissed with reasons to follow.
These are those reasons.
It also retained Garry Huntington, principal of General Recorders, as director of its Saskatchewan operation.
In result, some 30 Danka employees, primarily salesman and service technicians, took up employment with Brennan.
Most gave two weeks notice to Danka by resigning in the period October 21 to November 7.
[7] The entry by Brennan into the document processing market coupled with its hiring of Danka’s sales and service staff undoubtedly caused disruption and consternation for Danka as set out in its supporting affidavits.
(3) Injunctive relief until trial is necessary to protect Danka against irreparable damage and loss, mere inconvenience not being enough.","The petitioner sought retroactive child and spousal support of $47,367.
No children were presently dependent upon her and she was self-sufficient.
The parties married in 1963.
The mother was a homemaker until 1983 when they bought and operated a small town hotel which ultimately failed in 1990.
The petitioner alleged they separated in 1990 when the father left the province to seek work elsewhere.
He sent no money for two years until 1992 when he sent $3,200 and bought a washer and dryer.
She commenced a divorce action in 1996 which was adjourned sine die by consent.
The marriage was dissolved in June 1998.
The respondent did not keep records of money sent as he did not consider they had separated until 1993.
HELD: The claim was dismissed.
1)Nothing turned on the actual date of separation which was difficult to determine.
The mother was entitled to make a claim for support whenever she believed his contribution was inadequate, whether or not she perceived herself separated from him.
2)The primary purpose of a support order is not to compensate for past failure but to satisfy present need.
Making a retroactive order would not address that purpose.
She did not make a claim until 1996 and then did not prosecute her claim for another two years, at a time when neither she nor the children were dependent.","[0, 1, 2, 5, 7, 9, 3, 10, 27, 18, 22, 17, 13, 6]"

The German miller rejected some of the oats as having a high moisture content, the miller refused to pay the defendant, and the defendant refused to pay the farmer.
ISSUE[2] Did the plaintiff fulfill his contractual obligations to the defendant, and thus entitled to full payment of the contractual price?
BACKGROUND FACTS[3] The plaintiff (Wlaswich) is an organic farmer from the Kamsack region of Saskatchewan.
At the time of entering into this contract, he had the necessary certificates of conformity required to be a certified organic farmer in Canada, the United States and Europe.
Any reference to Hanowski in this judgment is a reflection of the operating mind of Bio Canada.
Hanowski had the real and apparent authority to enter into contracts on behalf of Bio Canada.
Hanowski represented Bio Canada at the trial.
That transaction was concluded successfully.
[4] Bio Canada wanted a sample of Wlaswich’s oats which was forwarded by Wlaswich to Bio Canada for inspection and approval, prior to entering into the contract.","Revenue Canada, which was owed $166,359.72 for goods and services tax for 1991-92 and $14,223.30 for 1991 unpaid personal income tax, and the Michaluks, who were owed $58,720.34 for a failed agreement and lease on their property in Manitoba, objected to the automatic discharge of the bankrupt.
The bankrupt contended that s241 of the Income Tax Act prohibits disclosure of tax information concerning both the bankrupt's common law spouse and the company of which she was sole director and shareholder.
The second preliminary issue raised was that portions of an affidavit were based upon information and belief as opposed to personal knowledge as required by Queen's Bench Rule 319 for a final matter.
HELD: A conditional order of discharge issued requiring the bankrupt to pay $1,750 from any source to the trustee by monthly installments of $100 per month.
Judgment interest would accrue on any arrears.
 1)This discharge hearing related to Nick Morin.
The relevance of the tardiness in remitting goods and services tax of his common law spouse's company was questionable.
The information was confidential and disclosure would be improper for these proceedings.
The principle and exemption contained in s295(5)(a) of the Excise tax Act would not allow disclosure of goods and services tax remittances in these proceedings.
2)None of the alleged facts raised pursuant to ss173(1)(a),(b),(d),(f) and (m) were proved.
It was not proven as outlined in s173(1)(f) that the bankrupt put them through unnecessary expenses by a frivolous and vexatious defence to the action.
The conclusion of the investigation conducted by the RCMP as a result of the superintendent's investigation order was that the evidence would not support a successful prosecution.","[4, 0, 1, 9, 10, 6, 5, 2, 7, 11, 13, 16]"

GREEN, J OVERVIEW:[1] In 2006, Sturgis Meats entered into a contract with Gardon Securities.
That contract covered both the installation of temperature monitoring equipment at Sturgis Meats and the month to month monitoring by Gardon Securities of the temperature in the freezer and cooler at this business.
Even with this dispute, Gardon Securities continues to monitor those temperatures at Sturgis Meats.
That monitoring is done by the Gardon Securities staff in Yorkton, based on information transmitted by the monitoring equipment over a telephone line from Sturgis Meats.
[2] The initial contract, in 2006, between the parties was for three years, and had a provision that the contract would renew thereafter.
The contract also states:Gardon Securities assumes no liability for delay or interruption of service due to any acts of God or cause beyond the control of Gardon including interruptions in telephone service.
Each of the invoices for these years contained a proviso saying: It is the responsibility of each customer to perform routine tests on each system (including components).","The applicant commenced an application pursuant to s19 of the Controverted Municipal Elections Act following the municipal election for mayor and counsellors at the village of Sandy Bay.

The respondents argued there was no jurisdiction to deal with the motion because the applicant had missed the limitation period for bringing this application as s19(1) of the Act states the application must be brought within six weeks after the election.
The fiat was granted beyond the time limit forty seven days later.
The applicant argued the time limit did not commence until after the completion of the judicial recount provided by s126-128 of the Local Government Election Act.
HELD: 1)Leave was granted to file further affidavit material proving the date the returning officer declared the results of the vote which was the crucial date for calculating the time limit for this application.
 2)The legislation is clear.
Section 103 of the Local Government Election Act states the deputy returning officer shall count the vote and provide a prescribed statement of results.
3)There was no evidence of the date the returning officer declared the results of the vote in accordance with s109.

This occurred on June 25, 2001.
The defendant had previously delivered to the plaintiff’s elevator 2.043 tonnes of flax which were applied to the contract leaving 297.957 tonnes undelivered.
That amount was to be delivered during the rest of June or July, 2001.

His demeanour was evasive and his subsequent behaviour was consistent with the contract having been reached.

Both testified.

that the defendant acted expeditiously to comply with its contractual obligation, on the basis of representations put forward on behalf of the plaintiff, to provide income replacement when the need was made apparent to it.

The policy was in effect for the period commencing August 1, 1997 and ending July 31, 1998 and provided coverage to Hurd except for those periods when he was in Saskatchewan.
[2] Hurd ordinarily resided with his parents at Melfort, Saskatchewan.
While home from Chicago during a study break Hurd had an accident while water-skiing following which he experienced chest pains.
On August 3, 1997 he consulted Dr. Nelson at Melfort who believed he had strained a muscle.
When the pain persisted, Hurd, on August 8, 1997, saw the family’s doctor, Dr. Lionel Lavoie.
[3] Dr. Kanthan resolved the pneumothorax by performing a thoracostomy, a procedure whereby a tube is placed into the pleural cavity, the chest area where escaped air is collecting.
The tube drains the air and allows the lung to re-inflate.
When Dr. Kanthan removed the tube the lung collapsed a second time whereupon the procedure was repeated, successfully so.
[4] On August 11, 1997, Dr. Kanthan discharged Hurd from hospital and reported to Dr. Lavoie that the pneumothorax was resolved and that follow-up treatment was not necessary.
[5] On August 12, 1997, Hurd returned to Chicago to continue his studies.","The Crown withdrew one count at the opening of the trial and the accused was charged with operating a motor vehicle while having a blood alcohol concentration in excess of .08 contrary to s.253(b) and s.255(1) of the Criminal Code.
In issue was whether the police officer had reasonable and probable grounds to make the breath demand; whether the demand met the requirements of the sample being taken by or under supervision of a medical practioner; whether the officer actually obtained information that taking the sample would not endanger the accused's life; whether the accused gave valid consent; whether the blood samples were taken as soon as practicable; whether the Crown could rely on the certificate where there was a reasonable doubt as to whether the physician took the sample himself or supervised a technician.
HELD: The accused was found guilty.
There was no basis on the evidence as a whole to exclude the Certificate of Analysis, which established the accused's blood alcohol level was 1.59 at the time of driving.
1)The officer had reasonable and probable grounds when he made the demand, including the accused was in the driver's seat; the odour of alcohol; the open bottle of beer; the nature of the accident.
2)Although the medical certificate could not be accepted as proof of the facts set out therein, the Crown did prove beyond a reasonable doubt by other evidence all the matters that could have been proven by the certificate.
There was a reasonable doubt as to whether the doctor addressed his mind to the facts and opinion to the truth of what he was certifying.
The doctor's mind was directed to the medical needs of the patient.
His evidence was based on normal practice - not specific memory.
There was no other logical conclusion that either the doctor or technician took the samples.
The doctor would not have given permission to take samples if there was any danger to the life or health of his patient.
3)Since the officer had reasonable and probable grounds to make a demand for a sample of blood, the accused's consent was not required.
4)The officer proceeded with all due diligence and without any necessary delay.
The blood was taken within a reasonably prompt time under all the circumstances.
 5)The accused's admission that the accident affected his memory of the events following it and had no recollection of having passed the other vehicle just prior and that he was not driving like he normally drove and was perhaps going too fast for the road conditions (the gravel road was a wash board but was not at its worst condition) were noted.","[0, 1, 2, 5, 6, 7, 4, 8, 10, 11, 13, 12, 14]"

Both parties made application to vary child support on the basis of changes (ups and downs) in the farming business.
The respondent wife, who recently purchased a house, also applied for lump sum spousal support which claim had been disallowed by the Court of Appeal.
Monthly spousal support terminated as wife now self-sufficient; child support increased due to increase in husband's income; lump sum payment of $8,000 awarded to wife to help pay her relocation expenses from move with husband given six months to pay lump sum, but monthly spousal support to continue until the $8,000 was paid in full.
Applications to vary should not be entertained simply because of the usual ups and downs of the farming business; the court must strive to average out the individual's ability to pay in such circumstances in order to ensure stability of payments for both parties.

At issue is the defendant's potential liability for failure to warn the plaintiff of the danger in using an airless paint sprayer.
FACTS On December 30, 1988, the plaintiff rented a paint sprayer from a shop called ""The Rent‑It‑Centre"" which is a tradename owned by the defendant.
No warning was given respecting any hazards in using the sprayer, and no warning was printed on the agreement.
After his painting project was finished, the plaintiff attempted to clean the gun with solvent in the manner which had been described to him.
He experienced difficulties.
The gun nozzle plugged and the paint and solvent dribbled out instead of spraying.
He became angry.
He bounced the sprayer on the floor and turned the switch on and off several times while activating the gun trigger.
A jet of paint and solvent mixture pierced the tip of the plaintiff's right index finger which he had unintentionally placed in front of the nozzle.

Naturally, the plaintiff wished to retain as much of the digit as possible.
He delayed his decision for about a week.","The divorce action was based on separation for more than a year.
 In issue were custody and access, child support, spousal maintenance, possession and division of matrimonial property.
HELD: 1)Divorce was granted.
The parties, married 19 years, had been living separate and apart since January 1998.
2)They agreed to joint custody of both children.
The son was to reside primarily with his father.
The daughter resided with her mother.
Access was essentially reciprocal on alternative weekends.
The children were to be together most weekends.
School vacations would be shared.
3)The father was to pay monthly child support of $485 based on his gross salary of $61,200 which included a $1500 car allowance.
Expenses for music lessons, band and extracurricular school activities did not qualify as a special or extraordinary expense.
The father was to contribute his proportionate share (73% to reflect spousal maintenance) of orthodontic expenses not covered by insurance.
4)Spousal maintenance of $900 was to be reviewable after December 31, 2003.
The mother's job advancement was impeded as a result of the marriage, specifically by frequent moves to accommodate her husband's job transfers.
She had worked out of the home for limited income to facilitate child rearing.
5)The parties agreed the matrimonial home would be sold and proceeds divided equally after payment of expenses of the sale.
Costs of any major repairs were to be split equally pending the sale.
The petitioner was entitled to occupy the property and was to pay the mortgage, insurance, utilities and other usual costs.
 6)It was inferred the value of the chattels was the same as that at the date of the marriage.
It would be inequitable to order a distribution of chattel property given as antiques or heirlooms by her parents valued in excess of $6,000.
The inheritance from her aunt who died almost a year after the separation was excluded.
The motor vehicles were divided in accordance with their value as of October 2000.
All other matrimonial property and debts and obligations were valued as of the date of the petition.
RRSPs were to be equalized as of October 15, 1999 by rollover.
7)The respondent was to convey one-half of the commuted value of his pension at date of the petition to a locked in RRSP in the name of the petitioner.
The balance in excess of the maximum amount transferable under the Pension Benefits Act resulted in an adjustment of $2,042.75.
The respondent was to assume any debts.
 8)No costs were awarded.","[1, 0, 3, 8, 9, 10, 6, 7, 17, 4, 13, 14, 18, 11]"

DEFENDANT Henri Chabanole for the plaintiffPatrick A. Kelly, Q.C.
for the defendantJUDGMENT BALL J. October 18, 2001[1] The plaintiff seeks damages for personal injuries sustained when she slipped and fell while grocery shopping in the defendant's Superstore in Regina on March 28, 2000.
The defendant places in issue:(a) Whether it is liable to the plaintiff for the injuries she sustained in this slip and fall accident; and(b) The degree of personal injury sustained by the plaintiff as a result of the accident.
FACTS [2] The plaintiff's claim followed the simplified procedure in Part Forty of The Queen's Bench Rules.
The plaintiff remained on the floor until an ambulance arrived.
The plaintiff subsequently consulted her family doctor, who prescribed more potent painkillers and recommended physiotherapy.
[3] On April 7, 2000 the plaintiff received the first of five physiotherapy treatments over a five week period at Regina Sports and Physiotherapy Clinic.
[4] Certain assertions in the plaintiff's affidavit relating to her injuries and treatment were inconsistent with the physician notes and medical reports filed in evidence and with information elicited during cross-examination.","The father was unemployed by reason of health problems and was in arrears on the December 13, 2002 child support order for $454 per month.
He was seeking damages against the federal government for alleged abuses suffered while attending an Indian Residential School.
The mother sought to attach the possible damage award for child support.
HELD: The first $50,000 of any settlement proceeds, after payment of reasonable solicitor fees and disbursements, shall be paid into Court by his counsel.
The Court agreed with the conclusion in Anderson that an order can be made with respect to damage awards even though, at the moment of the order, there is only a cause of action in existence and no precise amount of damages are known.
There was no question that a cause of action or chose in action is property and thus the subject of an order under the Family Maintenance Act s.8.
It is of no consequence that the order may be in another form such as money.
To adopt any different analysis would be to unnecessarily limit the remedial application of s.8.
Given the overarching purpose to ensure property is not wasted, thus impairing or defeating a claim under the FMA, it was logical orders can be made by the Court that are ancillary or a natural incident of the primary order preserving the property.
The mother was awarded costs of the application set at $350.","[0, 3, 1, 6, 5, 4, 8, 2, 10, 15, 11]"
415,"FACTS[2] The Defendants are the members of a partnership that operates an auto repair business in North Battleford.
The sole financial benefit for this activity was to go to Lionel Russell.
The only benefit that Triple R received was the opportunity to perform repair work for reward upon the consigned vehicles.
There was no sign or other indication that Lionel Russell was operating a business that was independent of the Defendant’s business upon the location.
he consignment agreement used in the present case showed the dealer to be “Triple R Auto Repair Sales and Consignment”.
It is noted that in the ordinary course of events, a purchaser would not see the consignment agreement.
The remuneration to Triple R is not set out on the document, but I am satisfied that it was to be 10% of the selling price.
Mr. Russell described this as a “lot fee.” Regardless of the label applied, it is compensation for finding a buyer and showing the vehicle.
This is the essence of a consignment relationship.
[4] On or about May 23, 2002, the Plaintiff went to Triple R looking for a car for his adult daughter to drive.
He had previously purchased a truck at this business.","The father, who was in arrears under an order requiring him to pay child support, applied to vary the support order which had been made less than a year before.
He failed to make the required financial disclosure and relied on a medical disability of which he gave no prior notice.
The judge allowed the application to proceed, over the objections of the mother, and reduced the child support obligation to $1 per month.
The mother appealed.
Appeal allowed;
the judge's decision to allow the application to proceed was procedurally unfair to the appellant and wrong in principle.
Only in rare circumstances should a party applying to reduce child support be heard absent that party making full disclosure.","[5, 8, 7, 4, 2, 10, 6, 11, 13, 12, 14]"

JUDGMENT[1] The plaintiff student argues that she was unjustly dismissed and so she sues the defendant business for wages that she would have earned had she worked to the end of the term of her employment.
The employer argues that the plaintiff was dismissed for cause.
Facts [2] The defendant (“Aquatain”) operates a business in Swift Current that does accounting work and that prepares income tax returns for its clients.
Mr. Hope, the president and director of the defendant company and the manager of the business, advertised for two positions in the April 17, 2004 edition of the local newspaper.
The ad stated that “(e)ducation in business or finance would be preferred.” and 2. a position as a receptionist for an undetermined period.
A “certificate in office automation or administration” was required.
On April 22nd, the plaintiff arranged to have an application for the position of summer student delivered to the defendant business.
[3] On April 29th, Mr. Hope interviewed the plaintiff.","Fulltext of judgment follows:
[1] This appeal from an order respecting custody and access to children cannot succeed.
The trial judge made no error of principle, and there was evidence to support his findings of fact.
He took all relevant matters into account and relied on no irrelevant matters.
Above all, upon a careful consideration of all of the evidence, we have not been persuaded that the interests of the children would be better served by the parenting regime proposed by the appellant.

(""A.
""), is the step-father of the plaintiff.
He pleaded guilty to a criminal charge of sexually assaulting the plaintiff.
On February 13, 1987, A. was sentenced to a term of ten months imprisonment, subsequently reduced on appeal to six months.
On April 4, 1994, the plaintiff commenced an action against A., claiming damages as a result of the sexual assaults.
A. did not defend the action.
The plaintiff has applied for judgment assessing her damages.
THE SEXUAL ASSAULTSThe plaintiff was born on […], 1975.
The sexual assaults commenced when the plaintiff was approximately eight years of age, and continued until she was eleven.
The assaults included digital penetration of the plaintiff's vagina, oral sex, intercourse, and attempting to force the plaintiff to have intercourse with her brother.
Many of the assaults occurred as the plaintiff was emerging from the bathtub.
The sexual assaults were revealed while the plaintiff was talking to a social worker on September 24, 1986.","This case concerns the fixture financing provisions of The Personal Property Security Act, 1993 (PPSA).
The respondent claims damages from the appellant Credit Union.
The claim arises from the Credit Union's delay in removing a Quonset in which the Credit Union held a security interest.
The trial judge found in favour of the respondent and awarded damages on the basis that the Credit Union became a tenant at sufferance of the respondent when it failed to remove the Quonset and therefore was obliged to pay rent.
The issue is whether the PPSA precludes a claim by a land owner against a financer arising from the financer's failure to remove a fixture within a commercially reasonable time after giving notice of its intentions in that regard.
HELD: Appeal allowed.
Cross appeal dismissed.
In light of the causes of action pled and the evidence brought forward, the respondent's claim against the Credit Union cannot succeed.
 1) Section 36 of the PPSA may speak exhaustively to the relative priorities of financers and land owners in fixtures.
It does not necessarily speak in that way to the full range of rights and claims that those parties might have against each other.
There is no principled basis on which a person with an interest in land should be denied meaningful relief when a financer, without excuse, acts in a commercially unreasonable manner by failing or refusing to remove a fixture after giving formal notice of its intention to do so.
2) It would have been improper for the respondent to deny permission to remove the building unless the Credit Union paid an amount in respect of the property taxes attributable to it.
Allowing a person with an interest in land to oblige financers to pay property taxes before realizing on their security would amount to a substantial realignment of the careful balance between the rights of fixture financers and holders of property interest reflected in s. 36 of the PPSA.
3) The Credit Union could not have been either a tenant at sufferance or a tenant at will of the respondent for the fundamental reason that there was no landlord and tenant relationship between them.
The respondent's claims in this regard fail.
4) The respondent has failed to present evidence that would allow this Court to quantify the benefit conferred on the Credit Union and to provide appropriate relief.
As a consequence, no effect can be given to the unjust enrichment argument.
5) In light of the conclusion that there was no tenancy at sufferance or tenancy at will, the cross-appeal fails.","[1, 0, 2, 5, 6, 9, 11, 12, 7, 8, 3, 14, 10, 16, 4, 18, 15]"

The requested relief cannot be granted unless the court has authority to order that a subdivision of land be effected outside the requirements of The Planning and Development Act.
HELD: 1) Even if this was a proper case for the making of a vesting order, there is a further difficulty presented by the fact that the applicant school division is asking the court to order that a subdivision be effected, as a pre-condition to the vesting order.
Whether under the former legislation or the present, the court is not free to subvert the statutory requirements in the exercise of its authority to make vesting orders.

While the court is precluded from directing the Registrar to effect a subdivision that is prohibited by the legislation, a resolution of the matter could be achieved if, for example, after adjudicating on all the rights and obligations at issue, the Court was prepared to direct that the pre-conditions to subdivision approval be met by a party to the proceedings.

The plaintiff alleges the contract price stipulated in the RTM agreement of June 26, 1992, and signed by both parties, was in error and seeks rectification of the contract.
The plaintiff has been building RTMs in the City of Yorkton since 1979.
An RTM as supplied by the plaintiff does not come with a basement.
It is the practice of the plaintiff to price an RTM and basement separately if a prospective purchaser seeks to have the plaintiff provide a basement as well as the RTM.
Of the 40 RTMs built by the plaintiff in 1992, no more than a half dozen involved supplying a basement.
The defendants dealings with the plaintiff were almost exclusively handled by Peter Skwerniuk who had been a commissioned salesman for the plaintiff for about 15 years.
The defendants had a set of blue prints and were wanting to have a home built to their specifications.
The plaintiff's claim depends upon what the defendants knew or ought to have known at the time the contract was drawn up on June 26, 1992.
The defendants acknowledge being provided with this information.","The applicant is a doctor enrolled in the orthopaedic surgery residency training program at the University of Saskatchewan (University).
He was suspended from the program since approximately March 2000.
There have been a number of legal proceedings between the applicant and the University since then.
An appeal committee of the University held that the applicant be allowed to resume his residency training on probationary terms.
This decision has not been implemented.
At issue is a College of Medicine policy governing students who are funded by third party organizations or governments.
The applicant is such a student.
His third party funding was depleted during the time he was suspended.
The College of Medicine insists he must find a third party sponsor prior to being allowed to resume his program.
The Lieutenant Governor requested that a judge of the Court of Queen's Bench perform her role as visitor in this matter.
HELD: 1) The court found the College of Medicine has not been objectively reasonable in the exercise of its discretion to insist that the appeal committee decision will not be implemented until such time as the applicant obtains third party funding.
The court found it did not properly or fairly apply the third party funding policy on the facts.
2) The applicant is entitled to relief.
The appeal committee decision will be implemented by the College of Medicine if the following conditions are met.
The applicant must enter into a written agreement with the College of Medicine whereby he agrees that the money he was paid while on suspension is prepayment for all of the services he will perform for the College of Medicine in the remainder of his residency, that he will not claim any salary or monetary benefits available to other medical residents pursuant to the PAIRS agreement, and he will indemnify the College of Medicine if it is required to make payments to him pursuant to the PAIRS agreement during the remainder of his residency program.
Further, PAIRS will enter into an agreement with the College of Medicine waiving the financial terms of the PAIRS agreement with respect to the applicant for the duration of his residency.

The action was under the simplified procedure in Part Forty of The Queen’s Bench Rules.
At trial, the affidavits-in-chief of the plaintiff’s witnesses were marked as plaintiff exhibits and the witnesses were then called for cross-examination by the defendant, followed by redirect questions from plaintiff’s counsel.
At the conclusion of the plaintiff’s evidence the affidavits-in-chief of the defendant’s witnesses were marked as defence exhibits, whereupon the witnesses were called for cross-examination and redirect examination.
The cross-examination is therefore critical to the assessment of credibility.
The cross-examination of the plaintiff took nearly two hours, exceeding the time suggested in the Practice Directive, but such extensive cross-examination seemed necessary to deal with the many issues raised by the plaintiff.
The Court took note of this and recognized that equal latitude may be required in the plaintiff’s cross-examination of the defendant’s witnesses.
Her role included decision making, especially in matters relating to the accounts.
It was transferred to the defendant as of October 1, 1997.
The plaintiff carried on her duties in much the same way as she had done previously.","A young person who suffered from considerable mental health issues and was in the permanent care of the Minister of Community Services applied to have the court exclude the public and the media from her court convened pre- sentencing conference.
The purpose of the conference was to assemble various professionals from diverse fields to discuss the complex issues surrounding the young person and to provide recommendations to the court as to an appropriate sentence.
Various of the professionals had expressed their concern as to their ability to participate in the conference if the media was present.
Application for access by the media denied; order granted excluding the public and the media from the pre-sentencing conference; the benefits of an exclusion order outweigh the deleterious effect of restricting the public's right to freedom of expression and the freedom of the press.
Although the court convened hearing is a public proceeding to which, prima facie, the open court principle applies, the attendance, cooperation and participation of the invitees to the conference (all professionals who were bound by laws, policies and agreements of confidentiality) was strictly voluntary and many, if not all, would be unable and unwilling to participate in a conference that was open to the public and the media.
The administration of justice was furthered by the court obtaining the best possible information from those identified as best able to provide it so that recommendations flowing from the conference would lead to the best sentence for the youth.
There were no alternative measures which would prevent or reduce the risk of non-participation by the professionals.","[1, 0, 4, 8, 9, 2, 18, 6, 12, 16, 5, 10]"

Johnson Seeds is a Manitoba corporation, and operates out of Arborg, Manitoba, and currently has approximately 20 employees.
Johnson Seeds purchases specialty crops from producers and contracts with purchasers, including other traders or packagers, for the resale of these specialty crops.
To secure the product for resale, Johnson Seeds will enter into contracts with growers prior to the seeding and harvesting of the same.
Always some flexibility is needed as the purchaser may alter the delivery times.
As well, the crops must be cleaned to meet the delivery standard required and Johnson Seeds must organize the operation of the processing plant to meet the needs of the purchasers.
Johnson Seeds has limited storage capacity so it is not possible for Johnson to take delivery from the growers as soon as the crops are harvested.","The deceased's cousin commenced an action for nervous shock after she observed the accident in which the deceased bicyclist was killed.

March 14, 1994 The plaintiff was injured in a motor vehicle accident on February 8, 1988, in the City of Regina.
Liability is not in issue.
The trial of the action concerned the level of damages to which the plaintiff is entitled.
Mrs. Wellman is now 72 years old.
She was 67 at the time of the accident.
Her injury was a whiplash injury which was according to medical evidence filed, substantially resolved over a period of about one year following the accident.
The difficult aspect of this case arises from the fact that Mrs. Wellman was involved in previous accidents and also suffered from diabetes, osteoporosis and hypertension.
She has delusions of a paranoidal nature which have made it difficult to obtain a clear picture of her subjective symptoms.
She was confined to a wheelchair from 1981 until 1983 following some back surgery and again in 1987.
She says that before the accident she could climb stairs with the aid of both handrails or with a cane and a handrail.","The tenants apply pursuant to s. 49(2) of The Residential Tenancies Act for leave to appeal a decision of the Court of Queen's Bench reviewing a decision of the Rentalsman.
HELD: Application allowed.
 1) The parties agree that the rent for July was paid on July 27.
The landlord then immediately applied for and was granted a writ of possession. 2)
The tenants advise that the landlord holds the equivalent of one month's rent as security for the payment of the last month rent of the tenancy.
The landlord claims it is a security deposit. 3)
The tenants claim they tendered the arrears on the basis that the landlord would not apply for a writ of possession and that the arrears were accepted on that basis. 4)
The Court of Queen's Bench Chambers judge dismissed the appellant's appeal the same day saying 'the rent for August has not been paid and not paid by required time, appeal is dismissed'.
5) The first issue on appeal is whether the Chambers judge erred in finding the Rentalsman had jurisdiction to make the order granting possession on the basis that 'the rent was 15 days in arrears when the Notice of Termination of the tenancy agreement was served and the tenant has failed to vacate the premises in accordance with the Notice' if the landlord accepted the rent in lieu of seeking a writ of possession.
The second issue on appeal is whether the Chambers judge erred in considering that the subsequent month's rent was not paid.","[0, 1, 4, 2, 3, 5, 6, 8, 7, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13]"

Ready and for the defendant, Ford Motor E. M. Kleisinger Company of Canada LimitedJUDGMENT BARCLAY J.
The action against Country Plaza Motors Ltd. (""Country Plaza"") was discontinued.
THEORY OF THE PLAINTIFFS The plaintiffs contend that the fire was caused by an electrostatic discharge through the U-shaped fuel tube in the Ford truck which was the subject of recall, along with 48,000 others, by Ford.
It was submitted that due to extremely cold weather conditions the electrical insulating qualities of the nylon fuel line were reduced to an extent that the accumulated static electricity discharged through the fuel line.
During this static discharge, pin holes would be created and gasoline would then leak out.
The vapour from the gasoline, being heavier than air, would settle to the bottom of the garage and would be attracted to the pilot light on the furnace.
The vapours would then be ignited by the pilot light.
There would then be a flashback to the area underneath the truck where the gasoline was pooled.
This location at the northwest corner of the garage would be where the fire originated as the combustible material under and near the Ford truck would ignite.","The Crown asks that the accused youth be detained.
The Crown concedes that there is no reason to detain the accused youth to ensure her attendance in court or to prevent further occurrences.
The Crown asks that she be detained because the crime is so horrible, the case is so strong and the public in La Ronge are so disturbed and shocked by the occurrence that to release the youth would cause a loss of confidence in the administration of justice.
HELD: The court does not keep a person in custody simply because they are accused of committing an offence.
There must be a necessary and substantial reason to keep a person in custody before they have a trial.
The accused youth will be released on strict conditions that will continue until her trial is complete.","[1, 0, 4, 13, 3, 10, 12, 7, 9, 14, 11, 5, 8]"

A.D. 1996 No.
The mobile home, and its contents, were insured with the defendant who has denied liability on the policy alleging that the plaintiff deliberately started the fire, or caused it to be started.
The plaintiff testified that he was awakened shortly before 6:00 a.m. by a buzzing noise from the smoke detector.
He found the mobile home already to be in flames and rushed to his grandparents' house to have them call the fire department.
He testified that when he returned to the mobile home, his brother, who also lives on the farm site, was present and they both attempted to gain access to the home but were prevented from doing so by the heat of the fire and heavy smoke.
Constable Bell of the Moosomin detachment of the R.C.M.P.
attended at the fire scene and took an initial statement from the plaintiff on that day.
In that statement the plaintiff stated the following:Smoke detector buzzed a few times and it woke me up.
My bedroom is at the west end of the trailer.
I had to come down the hallway to escape.
The fire was either in the living room or kitchen on the north side of the trailer.","FIAT: This is an application for an order striking out the plaintiff's claim in defamation pursuant to rule 173 of the Queen's Bench Rules.
HELD: The court declined to strike the claim.
1) Contrary to the submissions of counsel for the defendant, all essential elements of a claim in defamation are set out.
A reasonable cause of action is disclosed.
2) None of the affidavits filed speak to the circumstance wherein the impugned remarks were made.
Most importantly, there is no assertion by the defendant that the remarks were made in the course of her duties or were received by persons with a corresponding duty.","[0, 1, 3, 7, 4, 8, 9, 11, 5, 10, 6, 12]"

Based on the applicant's income, his child support payment is reduced from $500 per month to $425 per month.
 2) The applicant is in arrears in the amount of $56,365.60.

DEFENDANT (PLAINTIFF BY COUNTERCLAIM) - and -EMERALD PARK GOLF AND COUNTRY CLUB LTD. and THE TOWN OF WHITE CITY DEFENDANTSCounsel: Richard B. Morris, Q.C.
FACTS2) The plaintiffs Morley Cattell, Cheryl Mack, Craig Bosenberg and Paula Strassburg are neighbours and live in the community of Emerald Park just east of the City of Regina.
3) Until recently, the golf course was owned and operated by the defendant, Emerald Park Golf and Country Club Ltd. On January 12, 2005, the property was purchased by The Town of White City who entered into an agreement with Great Plains Leaseholds Ltd. and PW Lorch & Associates Ltd. for the continued operation of the course.
4) The plaintiffs, Cattell and Mack, acquired their lot in early 1997 and the plaintiffs, Bosenberg and Strassburg bought their home from the previous owners in February 2003.
5) In the span of approximately nine years, the plaintiffs, Cattell and Mack, have had approximately 1,000 golf balls per year enter their property.
7) The inconvenience is so great and the potential for injury so substantial that the plaintiffs have been prevented from using their yards during the seven months of the year that the course operates.","The respondent was charged with impaired driving contrary to s. 253(a) of the Criminal Code and driving while over .08, contrary to s. 253(b) of the Code.
The Crown appeals the acquittal on the charge under s. 253(b) of the Code.
At trial the Crown argued that, prior to searching the vehicle and having close contact with the accused in the police car, the RCMP officer did not have a reasonable suspicion that he had alcohol in his body and therefore did not make a screening device demand immediately.
On appeal the Crown submits that the trial judge accepted this and therefore there was no unlawful detention and the lapse of 17 minutes from the time he was placed in the back of the police vehicle until a demand was made.
The Crown submits that the trial judge was in error in concluding that the 17 minute delay was not warranted or necessary and that there was no breach of the accused's right to be free of arbitrary detention within the meaning of s. 9 of the Charter.
HELD: The appeal is dismissed.
It appears that the officer may have been anxious to search the vehicle in anticipation that more than just a charge of impaired driving could be supported.
Had he proceeded with a quick search of the vehicle and then proceeded with the demand in a short time period that may have been a reasonable violation of the accused's Charter rights.
It is obvious from the evidence that in the course of searching the vehicle, the police officer returned to the police vehicle where the accused was detained and he had a further conversation with him, following which he returned to continue his search of the vehicle.
In the circumstances, the delay of 17 minutes from when the police officer should have made the demand but did not and detained the accused in the locked police vehicle while he conducted a search of the accused's vehicle without arresting him, advising him of his rights and conducting a search of his vehicle is a violation of potentially three separate Charter rights.
The evidence of the subsequent breathalyzer and certificate of analysis is conscriptive evidence obtained following the breach of the accused's Charter rights and the trial judge properly ruled that pursuant to s. 24(2) of the Charter the evidence should be excluded and the charge dismissed.","[0, 1, 3, 9, 5, 8, 2, 14, 7]"

[2] The defendant resists the requested relief on the basis the plaintiffs did not validly exercise their right of first refusal.
(2) That the loan approval issued by Farm Credit Corporation is not an unconditional and unequivocal commitment to finance the purchase of the farm land.
[4] The defendant also counterclaims against the plaintiffs for rent it claims owing from the plaintiffs as over holding tenants.
Background Facts[5] The plaintiffs in 1988 surrendered to the defendant a considerable amount of farm land in circumstances which qualified them for the statutory right of refusal subsequently enacted in s. 27 of The Farm Land Security Act.
On March 24, 1997, the defendant accepted a written offer from a third party to purchase 14 quarter sections of the plaintiffs' previously surrendered land for a price of $629,280.00.
The letter dated March 24, 1997 stated in part as follows:If you intend to purchase the property, you must notify the Bank in writing within 15 days of receipt of this letter.
To effect this notification, please complete the top portion of the attached sheet and return.
If you do not intend to purchase the property, please complete the bottom portion of the attached sheet and return.","The two accused entered a guilty plea to committing an assault causing bodily harm contrary to s. 267(b) of the Criminal Code.

430,"ARNOT, J THE FACTS[1] Dennis and Anne Ens wanted to build a deck and a glass sunroom on the back of their home in Warman, Saskatchewan.
They attended a trade show in the spring of 2004 and met Mr. Doug Goertzen from Pacific Home Products Ltd.
The Defendant corporation is in the business of building decks and sunrooms and has been for 18 years.
Mr. Goertzen is the President and owner of the corporation.
Pacific Home Products Ltd. has built approximately 400 such sunroom additions to homes.
[2] Mr. Goertzen attended the Ens home in early April, 2004.
He had a discussion to ensure he knew what the Ens’ expected.
Mr. Goertzen attended the Ens’ home on May 5, 2004 with an amended quotation.
The total cost to the Ens was to be $11,847.53.
The Ens accepted the quote and a contract was made to supply and install a sunroom at the Ens home.
The Ens made a deposit of 20% which was $2,200.00 paid by cheque.
[3] Mr. Ens knew that Pacific Home Products Ltd. would be ordering the material to complete the project after they had received the deposit.
The project was to be completed in the summer of 2004.
Time was of the essence.","The first defendant was the lessee and driver of a motor vehicle that was involved in a motor vehicle accident with the plaintiff.
The second defendant was the lessor of the vehicle.
The plaintiff brought an action against both the lessor and lessee, arguing that the second defendant was liable, both as the owner of the vehicle under the Motor Vehicle Act and pursuant to common law vicarious liability, for the lessee's negligence.
The second defendant successfully applied for summary judgment, with the court finding that the lessor was not liable under the Motor Vehicle Act as the lease was not a 'rental contract' as defined in s. 62 of the Act and the lessor was not an 'owner' as defined in s. 2(ak) and the current state of the law did not suggest that a claim of vicarious liability had a real chance of success between a lessor and lessee.
Both the plaintiff and the first defendant appealed.
Appeal dismissed;
the reverse onus provision in s. 248 does not apply in this case; the argument that the lease was not a conditional sales agreement but rather a rental agreement had no real chance of success and the fact that a vehicle is subject to a lease does not change the fact that there is no vicarious liability at common law between the owner and the driver of a vehicle.","[3, 6, 1, 4, 7, 9, 11, 13, 5, 10, 2, 15, 12, 14]"

Following a voir dire and one-and-a-half days of trial, new evidence (which could be used to impeach the accused's credibility and contradict things she had told the police in the video statement) came to the Crown's attention.
The accused argued that the admission of this new evidence would adversely affect her approach to the trial as important tactical decisions had been made on the strength of the Crown's previous disclosure.
Mistrial declared; the accused is released from the undertakings and agreements made to date and has the right to re-elect her mode of trial.
The late disclosure breached the accused's ability to make full answer and defence owing to the decisions she had already made regarding her defence and trial strategy and prejudiced her in a number of ways, which prejudice could not be cured by an adjournment or other order at this late stage.
However, to proceed with the trial without the new evidence would be unfair to the Crown and compromise the court's 'truth seeking' function.","[3, 5, 4, 6, 8, 9, 7, 0, 13, 19, 17, 20, 24, 16]"

PLAINTIFF - and -LE BLANC AUCTION SERVICE LTD. and RITCHIE BROS. AUCTIONEERS (CANADA) LTD.
In the auction ring, where the auction is held “unreserved”, public impression is everything.
The auction must be clean, and it must appear to be clean, with each fall of the hammer signifying a sale to the highest bona fide bidder.
An owner of consigned property cannot bid, directly or indirectly, or allow another individual to bid on his behalf.
The guarantee was supplied by the defendant, Ritchie Bros. Auctioneers (Canada) Ltd.
The auction was to be conducted by LeBlanc Auction Services, a newly formed division of Ritchie Bros.
4) Ritchie Bros. had acquired the Saskatchewan company known as LeBlanc Auction Services Ltd., and the transaction was in the closing stages at the time the plaintiff was first approached to become a potential customer.
This raised questions as to which of the two documents contained the pith and substance of the parties’ agreement.
5) After the auction sale was concluded, the defendants refused to pay the plaintiff the guaranteed price.
Although these alleged breaches were the focus of considerable attention at trial, they are not central to my decision in the final analysis.
10) Finally, there is an issue concerning a combine sold “on terms” to a buyer at auction.","The testator failed to change his will (which appointed his ex-wife as the sole executrix and beneficiary of his estate) following his divorce.
He died shortly after amendments were made to the Wills Act providing that a divorce judgement nullified any bequests contained in a prior will of divorced parties.
The ex-wife (who had received one-half of the testator's property in the divorce) applied to have herself appointed as sole executrix and beneficiary.
Application granted;
although the parties' separation agreement included a waiver of any right to share in or administer the other's estate, it did not serve to revoke the will; nor did equitable estoppel apply in the circumstances.
The court adopted the reasoning in Re Thibault Estate (2009) and held that s. 19A of the Wills Act could not be read either retroactively or retrospectively.","[11, 7, 17, 3, 1, 6, 5, 26, 16, 14, 24, 12]"

A gun and many of the stolen items were found in the vehicle and all the occupants were charged with a number of offences, including robbery.

While at the police station, he pulled a ring that had been reported stolen out of his pants and placed it on his finger.
At his trial, one of the other men testified that he had pled guilty to the robbery; the driver testified that she had driven directly from her home to where the vehicle was stopped by the police, without stopping; and the complainant testified that he had been lured to the driver's house, where he was ambushed by her and three men, robbed and threatened.
Although his descriptions matched the two other males in the vehicle, he positively stated that the accused was not the third person.

HELD: Section 7(1) of The Small Claims Act provides that a Provincial Court Judge acts as a gatekeeper to insure that claims comply with the Act before they are issued.
In this role, the Provincial Court judge is exercising a quasi judicial function.
Counsel for the plaintiff has clearly indicated that the claim is a test case.
The plaintiff seeks declaratory relief.
A substantial amount of the claim involves an allegation of breach of contract, but neither the plaintiff nor the proposed defendants were signatories to the contract.
Accordingly, they would not be entitled to the benefit of the agreement.
As virtually all of the potential issues raised by these claims are declaratory in nature, they are outside the jurisdiction of the Provincial Court.
Any litigation over these issues must be done in the Court of Queen's Bench.","[0, 2, 1, 3, 4, 5, 6]"

(orally)[1] The proposed appellants applied to extend the time for filing a notice of appeal of a Court of Queen’s Bench trial judge’s order awarding costs to the proposed respondent payable by Spelliscy and Tapp, jointly and personally.
They propose to appeal essentially on the basis the award was punitive and inordinately high.
[2] I had orally refused to grant the extension for the reason I saw little chance of success on appeal.
Counsel for the proposed respondent advised the court the cost award was based on costs thrown away after the trial judge ordered a mistrial because of the prejudice caused by the proposed appellants’ address to the jury.","Under Part 40 of The Queen's Bench Rules (QBR), the plaintiffs commenced an action in 2009 against the defendant for the return of their deposit and the recovery of their costs for plans with respect to a residential construction contract.
The defendant denied the claim and affidavits were exchanged before a simplified trial date was set for May 2012.
The trial was rescheduled to June when counsel for the defence withdrew.
Just before the trial, the president of the defendant corporation requested that he be allowed to represent his corporation pursuant to Rule 10(2) of the QBR and notified the Court and the plaintiffs that his corporation had just been dissolved.
This development raised three issues to be decided before the simplified trial could proceed: 1) did the Court have jurisdiction to hear the simplified trial; 2) what is the status of the dissolved corporate defendant?; and 3) what is the appropriate process during the trial?
HELD: Regarding the first issue, the Court held that it had jurisdiction pursuant to s. 219(2) of The Business Corporations Act.
With respect to the second issue, the Court held that again, pursuant to its interpretation of s. 219 of the Act, that the trial should proceed and that the dissolved corporate defendant be allowed to defend the action on the ground that if liability continues, so should the right to defend the action.
As far as the third issue was concerned, the Court held that simplified trial would proceed and that the president of the dissolved corporate defendant would be permitted to represent it.
Since the parties had given notice that they wished to cross-examine the deponents of affidavits filed in each other's case, the Court ordered that the deponents be produced for the purpose of cross-examination.","[0, 1, 3, 2, 5, 4, 6, 7, 8, 9]"

I.
Introduction [1] The proposed appellants, McMillan LLP and Michael Friedman (collectively “McMillan”) are two of the defendants in the within action commenced by the proposed respondent, Melvin Schneider (“the representative plaintiff”).
In his statement of claim the representative plaintiff pled that he and others suffered financial losses due to negligence on the part of McMillan.
McMillan responded by seeking an order pursuant to Rule 173(c) of The Queen's Bench Rules striking the within action on the ground that it was devoid of merit.
They also opposed the certification of the within action on the basis that the relationship between them and the representative plaintiff was insufficient to found a recognized duty of care between a lawyer and non-client.
Consequently, no common issue existed upon which a class action could reasonably be certified.
[2] The learned Chambers judge dismissed the s. 173(c) application and certified the action as a class action against all defendants.","The defendant was charged with unlawfully harvesting forest products contrary to s. 79(1)(a) of The Forest Resources Management Act, unlawfully possessing forest products without a licence contrary to s. 79(1)(c) and unlawfully trafficking in forest products contrary to s. 79(1)(f) of the Act.
He was acquitted of the first two charges and convicted of the third.
He appealed his conviction.
He was fined $1,000 with a 40% surcharge.
The Crown appealed the sentence.
The appellant argued that since he was acquitted of the related charges, it followed that he should not have been convicted of trafficking.
The charges had arisen as a result of a lengthy undercover investigation into the activities of the appellant.
He was known to be harvesting fire kill in the Nesbitt Forest, which was Crown land.
He stored wood on his property and on that of a relative.
If the appellant was using it himself, he did not require a permit.
The undercover conservation officer purchased fire wood from the appellant, who told the officer that the wood was from Crown land in an answer to officer's question whether it was cut on private land.
The appellant did not testify at his trial nor did his relative and so the evidence of the conservation officer was uncontradicted.
The evidence presented on his behalf was from individuals who had purchased wood from the defendant.
The trial judge held that the charges against the appellant were strict liability offences and once the Crown had demonstrated beyond a reasonable doubt that the prohibited acts had been committed, the appellant had to establish on the balance of probabilities that he had been duly diligent and took all reasonable care to avoid offending.
With respect to the first two charges, the trial judge held that he was not satisfied that during the period described in the indictment that the Crown had proven the actus reus of the offences but that it had on the third count, based on the appellant's own words to the officer.
The appellant argued on appeal that his words could have been taken to mean that he was describing where he harvested wood for his own use and therefore his statement was not an admission that he sold wood to the officer or anyone else from Crown lands.
HELD: The Court held that the trial judge erred in his reasoning and conclusion that appellant was guilty of trafficking because he had not been duly diligent.
It is only if the actus reus was proven beyond a reasonable doubt that the considerations of whether due diligence had been proven would arise.
The conviction could not be maintained because the qualifying actus reus was not proven.
However, the other aspect of the evidence, which was not expressly considered by the trial judge and which would sustain a conviction, was if evidence established trafficking via another modality.
Since s. 2(dd) of the Act defines 'traffic' to mean 'to offer for sale, barter, deal, solicit or tradeÃ ' and s. 79(1) states that it is an offence to traffic in forest products from Crown land without a licence, then the offence is complete by offering the product for sale without a licence.
The appellant led no evidence to establish he had either the required permit to harvest forest products from Crown lands or a licence or any other form of authorization to deal in forest products.
Thus, the evidence established beyond a reasonable doubt that the appellant was guilty of trafficking in forest products contrary to s. 79(1)(f) of the Act.
The conviction was upheld.
Regarding sentencing, the Court held that it was important to deter other offenders.
The trial judge's sentence of a fine equivalent to the levy avoided (the provincial charge per cord of wood) was inappropriately low.
The Court set the appropriate fine at $5,000 plus a victim fund surcharge of 40% as required by s. 3 of The Victims of Crime Regulations.
If the fine was not paid within 60 days, the appellant would serve a term of imprisonment of 90 days.","[1, 5, 3, 8, 4, 7, 9, 6, 2]"

Non-Parties (Plaintiffs) - and -The Attorney General of Canada Prospective Respondent (Defendant) - and -The Presbyterian Church in Canada, et al.
Non-Parties (Defendants) - and -Merchant Law Group LLP Prospective Appellant (Non-Party)Before: Lane J.A.
[1] The prospective appellant, Merchant Law Group LLP (“MLG”), seeks leave to appeal an order of Gabrielson J. in Chambers dated December 11, 2012.
The Chambers judge was acting in his capacity as an Administrative Judge appointed pursuant to the Court Administration Protocol (the “CAP”) established as part of the settlement of the Indian Residential Schools litigation.
The parties are disputing MLG’s obligations under the VA and each had made an application to the Administrative Judge for directions.
[2] In issue is approximately $20 million in legal fees, disbursements and interest which MLG is claiming, and the prospective respondent (“Canada” or the “Government”) seeks verification of the claim.
Canada also argues the impugned order was a discretionary one attracting a deferential standard of review.
[5] There have been several judgments of the Administrative Judge dealing with the verification of MLG’s legal fees and disbursements, all of which provide a more extensive background to the issue before me.","The petitioner and the respondent had separated and had held a settlement meeting regarding the resolution of various issues.
The respondent filed a Notice of Objection to the petitioner's affidavit regarding the meeting and the appended exhibit that was entitled: 'Minutes of the Meeting'.
The petitioner stated that there was no agreement that what had been agreed upon in the meeting could not be used in evidence, although he acknowledged that not all outstanding issues were resolved in the meeting.
The other issues before the Court were the custody of the children, the parenting arrangements and whether the petitioner should pay interim spousal and child support and in what amount.
The respondent remained in the family home and sought an order for exclusive possession.
The 3 children of the marriage resided with her in it.
She had recently obtained a position as an educational assistant and would be earning $19,000 per year and the petitioner's annual income was $87,000.
The parties could not agree on who may claim the eligible dependant credit or AED for the children.
HELD: The Court held that because the parties had not reached agreement on all of the issues, the settlement privilege extended to the agreement.
Therefore, the exhibit and a number of sentences in the petitioner's affidavit were struck.
The Court ordered a shared parenting arrangement and gave the respondent an order for exclusive possession of the family home until June 2013.
The petitioner was ordered to pay $1,213 per month in child support and additional $186 per month to contribute to child care expenses and his proportional share of s. 7 expenses.
The petitioner was ordered to pay interim spousal support in the amount of $500 per month.
The Court reviewed the tax consequences to the parties, particularly in light of the shared parenting arrangement and noted that as the parties could not agree on who may claim the eligible dependant credit or AED for the children that that matter should be dealt with at the pre-trial conference.","[1, 0, 7, 2, 4, 5, 8, 13, 12]"

I understood that the custody portion of the young person’s sentence would run out before the next court date, on Monday, October 5th.
The Young Person was unrepresented and he, Crown counsel and the Court had no prior notice of this application such that we might address the issues in docket court that day.
I remanded S. T. T. to appear before me on Monday, October 6th.
On that date I ruled that he be released pending a full hearing of the application.
I indicated then that I would provide written reasons for my decision.
This decision addresses the procedure as well as the substance of the application.
Background[3] The Court was provided with a Review (Progress) Report in support of the application.
This in turn referred to psychological assessments and access was had to the Young Person’s file, specifically: a psychological assessment dated April 2, 2003 and the Pre-Sentence Report prepared for this sentencing, dated April 9, 2003.
The Crown filed a record.
[4] S. T. T. was born on February 12, 1985 and was 18 years of age when he appeared on this application.
The custody portion of the sentence expired October 5th and the community portion expires January 3rd, 2004.","Criminal Law – Strict LiabilityStatutes – Interpretation – Traffic Safety Act, Section 203(1)Traffic Safety Act – Motor Vehicle Offences – Passing Highway Workers or Equipment
The accused was charged with an offence contrary to s. 203(1) of The Traffic Safety Act, driving over 60 km/h passing highway workers or occupied highway equipment within a work zone.
The accused was charged as the owner of the vehicle, not necessarily the driver.
The offence was the result of a speed monitoring camera and the Act allows the Crown to complete their case without calling any witnesses.
The accused testified that he did not speed past any highway workers or equipment.
He said that he was following a pilot vehicle when he passed the workers and equipment and only sped up after the pilot vehicle turned around when there were no more workers or equipment.
The picture of the accused’s vehicle from the speed monitoring camera did not show any highway workers or equipment.
HELD: The person who tested and deployed the speed monitoring camera provided affidavit evidence that the picture was taken within a marked construction area but it did not say that the accused was speeding as he was passing highway workers or occupied highway equipment.
Section 203(1) specifies that there is only an offence for travelling at a speed greater than 60 km/h when passing highway workers or operating equipment.
The accused was found not guilty.","[2, 4, 8, 9, 6, 5, 3, 7, 11, 12, 14, 10]"

Parties are entitled to structure their legal relationships as they see fit.
The Court must determine whether the tax is payable based on the agreements as constructed between Husky and the third parties.
There was no evidence that Saskatchewan Finance and the third party contractors entered into an agreement to alter the nature of the contracts so that Husky paid PST when it would not otherwise have been obligated to pay.
The evidence established that Husky determined the way in which bids were submitted and the way Husky was invoiced.
In each contract, Husky required that the bid include a price for service and price for materials.
In each case, it was contemplated that PST was in addition to the price bid for the materials provided.
The contracts between Husky and the third parties all contain provisions and terms that provide for the sale of materials to Husky.
On the basis of the contracts, there was a sale of tangible property under the PST Act.
Husky was the user or consumer of the cement.
The third parties were providing materials and services to assist in the construction of the oil well.
Husky has failed to establish that the contracts were supply and install contracts.
Husky was the ultimate user and consumer of the tangible personal property.
Husky is not entitled to rely on mistake of law.
Husky has failed to establish on a balance of probabilities that it is entitled to a refund of the PST it paid on well cementing contracts between itself and third parties.

He was sentenced to a total of 35 months in prison.

The applicant rural municipality was granted an order in May 2014 by a Queen’s Bench judge that directed the respondent to comply within 60 days with an order of the applicant’s development officer.
That order had been made pursuant to s. 242 of The Planning and Development Act and required the respondent to comply with the zoning bylaw by desisting from operating an equipment storage yard on a parcel of land owned by him and to restore it to the condition it was in prior to his use of it.
The respondent had purchased the land in 2009 and immediately began storing equipment and leaving junk cars and other materials on it.
The applicant had tried to encourage the respondent’s voluntary cooperation with the bylaw but eventually issued the order.
After the court granted the order, the respondent took no steps to comply with it and in August 2014, the applicant applied for an order declaring the respondent to be in contempt of court.
The application was heard in September at which time the respondent submitted by affidavit that he had removed the old cars but believed that he was allowed to keep his equipment.
He requested that he receive additional time.
The respondent was given until December 2014 to comply with the order.
At the hearing he deposed that he had spent a significant amount of time and money removing materials from the land and that he had found out from his counsel that his belief regarding the permitted use of the land was incorrect.
Based on the appearance of the site, the applicant was not satisfied but agreed to adjourn the matter until May 2015 as nothing could be done during the winter.
When the matter was reviewed in May, the respondent had removed more equipment but said that he was not able to move it all as he had no place to put the rest of it.
The applicant requested that the court find the respondent in contempt and to impose appropriate penalties, authorize it to remove any remaining machinery and to add the costs of this removal and disposal to the taxes on the land and to make an order for solicitor-client costs in its favour.
HELD: The respondent was found to be in contempt of court pursuant to Queen’s Bench rule 11-16(3) for his failure, without reasonable excuse, to comply with the terms of the May 2014 court order.
The court authorized the applicant to remove and dispose of the equipment if the respondent had not done so within 30 days of the order issued.
The court awarded solicitor-client costs to the applicant in the amount of $15,000 because of the respondent’s continued and unjustified failure to comply with the zoning bylaw.
As the applicant might incur additional costs to remove the equipment, those costs would be added to the tax rolls of the property and become payable by the respondent if he had not purged his contempt within the allotted time.","[1, 2, 5, 4, 8, 7, 6, 9, 11, 10, 0, 15, 13, 3, 19]"

Kendall for the petitionerM.W.
Henderson for the respondentJUDGMENT GOLDENBERG J.
May 28, 1996 Angella and Archie Protz are husband and wife.
The relief sought is divorce, division of matrimonial property, maintenance and costs.
FACTSThe parties were married on July 23, 1960 when they were both 19 years of age.
They separated on December 10, 1991.
This action was commenced on August 10, 1993.
They have two adult children, a son and a daughter, who are both self-sufficient.
At the time of the marriage Mrs. Protz's occupation was that of key punch operator.
After the marriage she continued to work in that vocation.
At this time their daughter was born.
They had lived in Regina to that time.
At that time Mr. Protz's employment had been terminated and he was able to obtain employment as a salesman with the J.I.
Case company in Saskatoon.
As Mr. Protz wanted her to be at home until the children grew up she declined this position.
The world of technology waits for no one.","Family Law – Custody and Access – Best Interests of ChildFamily Law – Custody and Access – Interim – VariationFamily Law – DivorceFamily Law – Evidence – AffidavitThe parties were in a high-conflict situation and brought five interim applications with various requests.
They had three children, the youngest being born five days before a previous application.
At the initial application the respondent mother was living in the family home and the petitioner was living at the family cottage and expected to move into the new home when it was ready.
The petitioner did move into the home, which was a few blocks from the family home.
The youngest child was almost a year old and the petitioner was having increased parenting time with him.
The parties agreed to have a custody and access report prepared.
The issues were: 1) divorce; 2) registration of the middle child in Montessori school.
The respondent opposed the child attending the school because he was not yet potty trained.
The petitioner advised that the school was okay with the child not being potty trained; 3) to take the child to a speech therapist.
The parties ended up resolving the issue before chambers; 4) varying the existing parenting arrangements. 
There was an interim order from January 2015 made shortly after the third child was born.
The respondent had since hired a full-time nanny.
The respondent did not necessarily oppose the petitioner spending more time with the youngest child, but she wanted to be the one to control the developing of that time.
The petitioner wanted the child Wednesday afternoon to evening and Sunday from 11:00 am to 4:00 pm.
He also wanted increased time with the two older children so that he could get them to their necessary activities and so that they could continue to develop their bond with him; 5) arrears of child and spousal support; 6) the respondent’s request to return the 2005 vehicle.
The vehicle had been at the parties’ farm and was damaged beyond repair without insurance.
The petitioner then towed the vehicle to the respondent’s home; 7) objections to one of the petitioner’s affidavits; and 8) costs.
HELD: The issues were decided as follows: 1) the divorce was granted because the parties had been separated in excess of a year and no satisfactory reasons were argued for not allowing it; 2) the court held that it would be appropriate for the child to be enrolled in the Montessori school.
The cost of the program was ordered to be paid by the petitioner.
The parties were to agree on the child’s transportation to the school and if they could not agree the petitioner would transport him; 3) the court kept the issue under its jurisdiction so that either party could bring the matter back upon two days’ notice; 4) the pre-trial conference was months away and the court did not find it appropriate to have the matter of increased parenting time proceed to a pre-trial conference, as a stand-alone issue.
The court found that it was in the best interests of all the children to have further time with the petitioner as he requested.
The court also dealt with transportation for the hockey and the middle child’s skating; 5) counsel agreed that the issue of arrears due under the support provisions would await further discussion at the pre-trial conference with either party having leave to bring the matter back on two days’ notice; 6) the matter was adjourned sine die on two days’ notice; 7) the complaints were not generally well-founded; and 8) the petitioner was entitled to costs of $1,000 in any event of the cause.
The respondent was entitled to costs of $200 in any event of the cause.
The court declined to send the matter to the high-conflict mediation program.","[1, 2, 5, 4, 0, 7, 10, 8, 12, 9, 17, 6, 3, 13, 11, 15, 20, 23, 25, 19]"

Now to be decided is whether the order should be confirmed as an order of this court, or whether it should be terminated or varied in its terms.
The Victims of Domestic Violence Act came into force on February 1, 1995.
It is a novel piece of legislation intended to protect domestic antagonists from violence one against the other and, in an emergency, to provide immediate relief from a turbulent predicament.
The Act provides for two types of orders.
A victim's assistance order may include any number of remedies directed at securing the safety of the victim and the security of the victim's property.
""An emergency intervention order"" is the second type of available order, although curiously, it is the one that gets the legislation's first focus.
Not until s. 7 does the procedure for obtaining a victim's assistance order appear.
It is an extraordinary remedy to be granted only where serious and urgent circumstances indicate a need for prompt action to protect the victim.
It is upon this point that the order now under consideration founders.","Criminal Law – Evidence – CredibilityCriminal Law – Evidence – Expert Evidence – Blood Alcohol ConcentrationCriminal Law – Impaired Driving – Blood Alcohol Level Exceeding .08
The accused was charged with three Criminal Code offences: driving while impaired, contrary to s. 253(1)(a); driving over .08, contrary to s. 153(1)(b); and with failing to stop for a police officer as soon as reasonable in order to evade that officer, contrary to s. 249.1(2)).
As he was completing a traffic stop, an officer heard the accused’s truck in the early morning hours.
When the officer engaged his police vehicle emergency lights, the accused spun his tires, fish-tailed, and took off.
The accused failed to stop at two stop signs and eventually stopped in the driveway of his house.
The accused was arrested for the s. 249.1 offence and was given a breath demand after he failed as ASD.
He failed the ASD between 3:01 and 3:03 and the breath samples were taken at 3:55 and 4:17.
The accused admitted that he was drinking alcohol that evening, but denied being impaired.
He said he was not trying to evade the officer when he failed to stop for him.
He also said that alcohol he had just had was not in his system yet when he was driving, but was at the time of the breath samples.
The officer indicated that the accused had glossy, watery eyes, but his walk and speech were fairly normal.
The officer smelled alcohol coming from the accused, but was surprised he did not show more impairment given his driving.
The accused indicated that he had consumed six beer that day, but the officer noted more than six empty beer cans on the accused’s table when he was getting his shoes.
The accused indicated that he downed six or seven ounces of vodka just before driving at 2:45.
An alcohol expert and the accused testified.
The defence expert testified that the accused’s blood alcohol concentration (BAC) at the time of driving would not have been over .08 based on the drinking the accused testified to.
The issues were: 1) whether there was proof beyond a reasonable doubt that the accused’s ability to drive was impaired by alcohol; 2) whether the accused’s evidence raised a reasonable doubt that his blood alcohol concentration was over the legal limit at the time when he finally stopped his vehicle; and 3) whether the accused had reasonable excuse for not stopping immediately for the officer and whether his actions amounted to him evading the police officer.
The accused had nine drinking and driving convictions since 1982 with the most recent in 2007.
HELD: The issues were determined as follows: 1) the Crown did not prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the accused’s ability to drive was impaired; 2) section 258(1)(d.1) deals with the last drink defence.
The court had to be satisfied that the accused’s drinking was consistent with his BAC being not over .08 at the time of driving yet being consistent with the BAC’s in the Certificate of Analysis.
The court preferred the officer’s evidence over the accused’s, given the drinking affected his recollections.
The court was not satisfied that the defence provided a credible account of the accused’s alcohol consumption.
Given the findings, the court was unable to apply the expert’s opinions.
The court did not have a reasonable doubt regarding the accused’s guilt on the driving while over .08 charge; and 3) there was no doubt that the accused knew he was being pursued by the police and did not stop as soon as was reasonable in the circumstances.
The court concluded that the accused did not have a reasonable excuse for not stopping.

[2] The second application is brought by the respondent, Susan Feist, for an order varying the custody order of Mr. Justice R.D.
Maher, dated the 3rd day of August, 2005 by changing the primary residence from the petitioner to the respondent.
[3] In dealing with the second application first, the test for variation has been set out in cases such as Talbot v. Henry (1990), 1990 CanLII 2648 (SK CA), 84 Sask.
R. 170 (C.A.

25, the court states:[25] Thus there is a two-stage inquiry: (1) The reviewing judge must determine whether there has been a change in the condition, means, needs or other circumstances of the children.
In determining whether there has been a change, substantially different considerations apply.
The parties are not in pari passu, and the person seeking to vary the order bears the onus as described above of demonstrating a material change which will adversely affect the needs of the children.
If there has been no material change, the inquiry ends there and the order remains.","Criminal Law – Murder – Second Degree Murder – Conviction – AppealEvidence – Unsavoury Witnesses – Vetrovec Warning – Charge to Jury
The appellant had been found guilty of second degree murder following a trial before a judge and jury.
He appealed on the ground that the trial judge had failed to give the jury a Vetrovec warning regarding the testimony of his former common law spouse (S.S.) and a witness who had been his friend (W.D.) who was the source of the gun used in the shooting of the victim.
The appellant’s trial counsel had initially identified the need for the judge to issue the warning because W.D. had an interest in the outcome because there were outstanding charges against him and because there was the potential that S.S.would be charged too, she would also have an interest in the case as well.
During the pre-charge conference with defence counsel and the Crown, the trial judge noted that in giving the warning to the jury he would also have to convey a summary of the Crown’s confirmatory evidence.
The defence counsel then withdrew his application.
The victim had been a friend of the appellant.
According to S.S.’s testimony, the appellant and the victim had pre-arranged a meeting in an abandoned farmyard.
The victim worked as an automated teller machine (ATM) technician and as part of his job, he travelled between ATMs carrying cash.
S.S. did not see what happened between the two men but heard two gunshots and then saw the appellant and the victim point guns at each other.
She saw the victim on his knees pleading with the appellant and offering money in exchange for his life.
The appellant instructed her to collect the money and the victim’s cellphone and place them in his truck and while she was doing so, she heard another gunshot and saw the victim lying face down and the appellant standing over him holding a gun.
As she and the appellant left the scene, the appellant gave her the victim’s gun.
The appellant hid the other guns and the money at another farm site and then dumped the victim’s cellphone and ammunition in a farm field.
Apart from the handguns, none of the other items were ever recovered.
The witness remained in a relationship with the appellant for another four years following the crime until November 2013.
She was contacted by the police in February 2013 and denied any knowledge of the incident.
At trial, S.S. testified that she was afraid of the appellant and he had warned her that as an accomplice, she was as involved as he was.
When the RCMP contacted her again in May 2014, she again denied any knowledge but then told the officer what she knew because she felt safer and would receive protection from the appellant.
S.S. did not have a criminal record, nor was she charged with any offence arising from this incident.
The appellant testified that during the meeting in the farmyard, the victim produced two handguns and they began to test fire the weapons.
The victim suggested that they stage a fake robbery.
The appellant would rough up his friend and then take the cash from his truck.
The victim became quite aggressive after the appellant hit him too hard and began chasing him with one of his guns.
S.S. then took one of the guns and shot the victim three times.
She took $23,000 in cash from his truck because she had financial problems.
The testimony of W.D. was that the appellant had acquired two handguns, a Glock and a .22 calibre handgun, from him, ostensibly on behalf of another friend.
Several days later, the appellant returned both handguns and reported that after his friend began to shoot at him with the .22 calibre, he had returned fired and shot him three times.
On the appellant’s insistence, the witness changed the barrel of the Glock handgun several months later.
The police arrested W.D. and charged him with unspecified offences arising from the incident.
In the appellant’s version, he testified that the victim brought the guns to the meeting and assumed that he acquired them from W.D. He therefore returned them to W.D. after the incident and requested that he change the barrel on the Glock to protect W.D.
HELD: The appeal was dismissed.
The court found that the trial judge had not erred by not giving the Vetrovec warning.
It was not mandatory for him to do so regardless of the position of the defence counsel.
The judge was aware of the need for such a warning in the circumstances and after consulting with the Crown and the defence, he exercised his discretion to decide that he would not instruct the jury.
The judge was aware that the defence counsel withdrew his application as a tactical decision to avoid having the judge repeat the Crown’s confirmatory evidence to the jury.
The judge’s exercise of his discretion was entitled to deference.","[1, 3, 0, 2, 6, 7, 9, 10, 11, 12, 8, 14, 13]"

[2] On March 30, 2005, this Court made an order fixing the parties’ incomes and providing for ongoing support for Brett of $129 per month.
It also terminated Mr. Gore-Hickman’s payments for Brett as of that date.
The issue of whether these orders should be made retroactive was reserved and that is the sole issue now before the Court.

On February 28, 1992, Justice M. Y. Carter granted a judgment for divorce after trial in which the parties were given joint custody of their two sons with primary residence to be with their father.
This was done even though Mr. Gore-Hickman had primary residence of the children.

The applicant insurance company sought an order for interpleader pursuant to Queen’s Bench rule 6-75 regarding premium surpluses it held in the amount of $3,550,800 that were generated between 1990, when it issued a group life insurance policy to the respondent, Agricultural Credit Corporation (Ag Credit), and 2015, when Ag Credit terminated the policy.
The applicant requested that the monies be paid into court and that directions be provided as to how the determination of ownership would be decided.
Ag Credit took the position that the funds paid as premiums were Crown funds and thus any surpluses were the property of the Crown and properly payable to Ag Credit as its agent.
It argued that the interpleader order was unnecessary.
The purpose of the group life insurance was to ensure that outstanding loans made by Ag Credit to borrowers were paid in the event of the borrowers’ deaths.
Individual borrowers paid the premiums applicable to them by paying those amounts to Ag Credit, who remitted the payments to the applicant.
There was no clear direction regarding the surpluses in the policy or in the Superintendent of Insurance Guidelines or applicable legislation.
HELD: The application was granted subject to the court hearing further submissions from both parties regarding such things as whether the surplus should be paid into court or left to be administered by the applicant during the proceedings.
The court found that the insurance company was entitled to some form of interpleader relief and dismissed Ag Credit’s claim to the surplus.
It ordered that a representative be appointed to represent the class of insured clients in the proceedings in order to determine who was entitled to the surplus.","[1, 6, 15, 4, 21, 7, 0, 5, 30, 12, 17, 35, 18, 24, 9, 32]"

She is employed with a local auctioneer.
The respondent father, before, during and after the relationship, is part of a farming partnership with two brothers and two cousins running a mixed grain and cattle operation.

Issues[2] What amounts, if any, are to be added to the sources of income set out in the father’s total income in his T1 General form to come to the appropriate level of income for the purpose of calculating child maintenance payments?
The father’s income has fluctuated significantly in the last three years, and the inherent nature of farming is such that it is more appropriate in the circumstances of this operation to use a three‑year average.
In assessing each of the issues, I will deal with them on a year‑by‑year basis.

Unknown to Sebastian, McCallum Hill had arranged for coverage outside of that which is usually provided for in the policy.
The coverage was referred to as a “manual narrative”.
This special coverage covered loss or damage due to accidental breakage of their Swarovski collection.
The Homeowners made a claim under their house insurance policy.
SGI denied coverage on the basis of the exclusion in the policy; the loss was due to an accidental breakage, which did not constitute a “listed peril” as defined in the policy.
[4] The Homeowners sued Sebastian and TWC alleging negligence or breach of contract for failing to obtain the coverage for insurance as instructed by the Homeowners.
Further, the trial judge concluded that the insurer, SGI, owed a duty of care to both Sebastian and TWC, and the Homeowners, to properly underwrite and deal with the application for insurance.
The negligence of Sebastian and TWC is not disputed in this appeal.","The plaintiff claimed damages for injuries suffered as a result of his car being hit from behind.

He was married and had two young children.
Mr. Roberts had no criminal record and a pre-sentence report suggested that he was a low risk to re-offend.","The Respondent and the Applicant had a violent argument after which the Applicant and the child left the matrimonial home and moved to Transition House.
The Applicant sought and obtained an emergency intervention order under The Victims of Domestic Violence Act from a Justice of the Peace giving her exclusive occupation of the matrimonial home and restraining her husband from having any contact with her or their daughter during the currency of the order.
This order was then brought before a Queen's Bench Judge as required by s.5 of the Act for review.
The reviewing Judge refused to confirm the order and directed a rehearing as permitted by the section.
The matter then came before this Judge for the rehearing ordered.
HELD: Order vacated.
 1)An emergency intervention order is granted by a Justice of the Peace under s.3 of the Act without notice to the person whose conduct it restrains and without any representations from that person or on that person's behalf.
It is an extraordinary remedy to be granted only where serious and urgent circumstances indicate a need for prompt action to protect the victim. 2)Absent such urgency, the application should be one for a 'victim's assistance order' brought to a Queen's Bench Judge in Chambers under s.7 in accordance with The Queen's Bench Rules.
3)In this case the domestic violence complained of occurred on January 28.
There was no evidence that on February 1, 1995, Dolgopol was at risk of immediate harm.
There was by then no element of urgency and the application for relief should have awaited the regular Queen's Bench Family Law Division chamber sittings.
 4)The Court commented that it was unclear whether this rehearing was to proceed de novo or as a review but determined that the order should not stand in any event and therefore terminated it forthwith.","[0, 2, 3, 5, 6, 1, 4, 7, 9]"

(orally)[1] The respondent, a resident of Manitoba, was convicted of having in his possession a controlled substance for the purpose of trafficking contrary to s. 5(2) of the Controlled Drugs and Substances Act[1] (the “Act”) and was sentenced to a term of incarceration of nine months with a 10 year firearms prohibition.
The offence took place in Yorkton.
The sentencing judge refused to order forfeiture of the truck the respondent was driving when he was arrested.
[2] The respondent was nearly 22 years old at the time of the offence and had no prior record.
He was found to have in his possession some 241 ecstasy pills and some marijuana.
[3] The sentencing judge referred to authorities with an accused of a similar age, or with drugs of a similar street value.
The judge was satisfied the respondent was a low risk to reoffend and of no real danger to society.
[4] We are all of the view the sentence imposed was at the very low end of the range but, in these circumstances, find there is no basis for interfering with the sentence imposed.","The appellant was acquitted of communicating with another person for the purpose of prostitution.
A new trial was ordered on the basis that the Provincial Court judge included a requirement as an element of the actus reus for an offence under s.213 that there be a specific conversation with the respect to payment of money for specified sexual services.
The Queen's Bench judge concluded that this was an error in law and cited as a correct test that set out in R. v. Schmidt.
HELD: The proper disposition is to set aside the judgment and restore the decision of the Provincial Court acquitting the appellant of the offence.
1)On reading the entire oral judgment the court concluded that the judge was saying in effect that the evidence failed to convince her beyond a reasonable doubt that the offence had taken place.
2)The trial judge was incorrect in finding that under s.213 the actus reus must include a specific conversation specifying the sexual services and the money to be paid.","[3, 5, 4, 2, 8, 9, 12, 6, 1]"

Yellow Quill First Nation (Yellow Quill) applied for intervenor status in support of the position of the respondents.
[3] On October 7, 1997 when the motion was argued, the chambers judge, without giving reasons, granted Yellow Quill intervenor status and standing and ruled the affidavit evidence was admissible.
He also found, without giving reasons, that the project being constructed by KSS was a “development” as defined in The Environmental Assessment Act.
The application for mandamus was adjourned sine die.
We were able to identify two fundamental issues, the decision of which permitted us to determine the rights of the parties to this appeal and to render an oral judgment.
Notice of Appeal[5] KSS appeals the decision of the chambers judge on essentially the following grounds:1.","FIAT. The petitioner sought interim custody of his son.
The respondent contested that the petition for divorce was a nullity and Saskatchewan courts did not have jurisdiction to hear the divorce proceedings and lacked jurisdiction or ought to decline to exercise jurisdiction under the Children's Law Act.
Both parties made serious allegations against the other and there was substantial conflict in the affidavit evidence.
HELD: An order for interim custody was granted on the condition the petitioner continued to reside with his parents in Regina and that the child not be removed from Regina without further court order.
1)The respondent did not acquiesce to the child's residing in Saskatchewan such that it may be said he was habitually resident here for the purposes of the Children's Law Act.
 2)The seven factors listed in s15(1)(b) are conjunctive and the petitioner must satisfy them all.
With respect to (iii) a petition for divorce was commenced in July 1996.
3)The child had a real and substantial connection with Saskatchewan and it was appropriate to exercise jurisdiction pursuant to s15(1)(b).
Jurisdiction existed pursuant to s15(3) as the child had a closer connection to Saskatchewan then to Alberta.

The appellant, who is mentally handicapped, appeals the entrusting of custody of her five year old son to the respondents.
The child was born in July of 1989 and in May of 1990 the appellant and her child were placed in the home of the respondent [M.H.].
The child and his mother were placed with [M.H.]
and [A.H.] pursuant to a Family Support Services Contract whereby the Harrises were to ""spend individual time with [R.M.F.]
in supervising and teaching her to properly care for [A.]
[M.H.]
The child was in the care of the appellant and the respondents from May of 1990 to June 1992 and since that time solely in the care of the respondents.
The relationship between the appellant and the respondents broke down and she left the care of the respondents on May 30, 1992.
The facts are more completely set out in the judgment of Dickson J., which judgment is appealed from, in essence, on the following two grounds:1.","The only issue was the amount of monthly maintenance to be paid by the respondent for the one child.
The average income of the respondent over the past three years was approximately $180,000.
The applicant claimed her 1996 income of $128,000 was extra-ordinary as payment was received for projects completed in the previous two years.
The applicant claimed special monthly expenses of $1,200 to cover nanny and child care costs, $125 for medication, $25 for recreation and $200 for a university fund.
HELD: 1)The respondent was to pay $1,794 per month.
Section 4 of the guidelines was applicable.
The significant income of the applicant is a factor to be taken into consideration.
2)The applicant did not establish that the claims for recreation and the university fund were expenses that were 'special' or 'extra-ordinary'.
3)The respondent was responsible for 2/3 of the nanny and child care costs which were justified pursuant to s7(1)(c) of the guidelines.","[0, 1, 4, 5, 6, 3, 7, 8, 12, 10, 14, 13]"

IN THE COURT OF QUEEN'S BENCHJUDICIAL CENTRE OF PRINCE ALBERT BETWEEN:ZELMA LEE KORPESS APPLICANT- and - SASKATCHEWAN GOVERNMENT INSURANCERESPONDENTM. D. Popescul, Q.C.
Any benefits she is entitled to receive are in accordance with The Automobile Accident Insurance Act, as amended by The Automobile Accident Insurance Amendment Act, 1994, S.S.1994, c. 34.
She received a death benefit for herself and for her two children.
Because she took issue with the calculation of the amount paid, her counsel applied for a review of the decision as provided by the Act.
The review by the respondent, Saskatchewan Government Insurance (""SGI""), gave the same results.
THE ISSUEThe essence of Korpess' application is that SGI has not correctly interpreted the provisions of the Act for calculating the death benefit that should be paid to her as a surviving spouse.
She takes no issue with the calculation of the payment to her for the dependent children.
Oppositely, SGI contends that it is entitled to calculate the payment to the surviving spouse on the basis of the deceased's net income.
The method of calculating as defined by the Regulations simply clarifies that the income is based upon actual earnings of the deceased.","The two accused, both Metis, were separately charged in 1993 with six fishing offences relating to the use of nets.
The accused who had ten nets on two lakes at the time of seizure admitted to being commercial fisherman.
The Crown had stated to the defence that fishing for commercial purposes would not be an issue.
The trial judge dismissed the defence motion for a direction that the Crown comply with his undertaking that the issue was whether the Metis of Northwestern Saskatchewan have an aboriginal right to fish for food.
The Provincial Court Judge found both accused not guilty on three of the counts on the basis of standard criminal law defences but would have convicted on the other three charges but for the constitutional defence.
The Crown appealed the acquittals based on the constitutional defence.
Grounds for appeal included failure to distinguish between an Aboriginal right to fish for food and for commercial purposes; failure to find the accused were engaged in commercial fishing and that neither the accused nor their ancestors possessed an Aboriginal right to fish for commercial purposes; by concluding that scrip issued to Metis pursuant to s6(f) of the Dominion Lands Act and Order-Council did not extinguish any Aboriginal right to fish for food or commercial purposes; the trial judge erred by failing to conclude that the requirement to obtain a licence before fishing with a net was not a prima facie infringement of an existing aboriginal right to fish for food; in acquitting the accused when neither the Aboriginal rights defence nor equality rights defence had any application to the charge.
The Saskatchewan Metis Nation and National Council were granted Intervenor status.
HELD: 1)The first three grounds were dismissed.
The trial judge found that the Crown had not breached an undertaking, nor misrepresented its position with respect to the constitutional issue but implicitly found that the respondents had been prejudiced through the misunderstanding during pre-trial communications between council as to the issues that would be argued during trial.
The trial judge was entitled to find as fact that it was not the intention of the parties to confine the issue to commercial fishing.
2)Once it was determined the actual activity was fishing for the purpose of selling the fish, the only rights that could be said to be infringed were either the right to exchange fish for money or goods or the right to fish commercially (Gladstone).
The aboriginal right to fish for food was no longer relevant because the evidence did not establish that as the activity they were engaged in.
3)The trial judge's finding that an Aboriginal right to fish existed in Metis persons of northwest Saskatchewan separate and apart from the issue of aboriginal title was one he was entitled to make and should not be disturbed.
The case law makes it perfectly clear that aboriginal rights are site specific and the finding of a right in one group in one location does not establish the same right for another group in another location (Van der Peet).
4)There is no basis to distinguish between Indian and Metis people when considering whether a licensing requirement constitutes an infringement of the aboriginal right to fish for food.
5)The departmental policy which placed a higher priority on treaty Indian fishing than domestic licence food fishing for Metis persons constituted an infringement.
Once an infringement is found the onus shifts to the Crown to demonstrate that the regulation is justifiable.
The infringements could not be justified because they did not relate to any identifiable objective that made them necessary.
6)The trial judge should not have based his decision on the Charter when it was not part of the argument before him without first giving counsel the right to address the argument.
7)Since there is no requirement on a Metis person in the geographical area delineated to have a licence it followed that Regulation 27 requiring a person to legibly mark the licence number of the stakes was also an infringement that could not be justified.","[1, 0, 2, 8, 6, 5, 7, 10, 15, 3, 11, 14]"

[2] This self-represented tenant included, as grounds of her appeal, “procedural violations” and “misinformation as to the purpose of the hearing”.
[3] The court’s detailed review of the application and proceedings before the Hearing Officer, including the written statements and communications sent to the rentalsman by the tenant, reveal the tenant’s concern over the short notice that she received of the hearing held March 11, 2008.
This prompted the tenant to request, in writing, an adjournment so that she could make arrangements to personally attend the hearing.
A second issue revealed by the materials and presumably referenced by the other ground of appeal is the preoccupation, at the hearing, with evidence concerning the activities of the tenant’s boyfriend and the impact his actions had upon the premises and disturbances caused by him had upon another tenant and his daughter who also resided in the building.
It was the tenant’s position that she was caught by surprise by this aspect of the hearing since no reference was made to this specific complaint in the landlord’s application.
In a letter the tenant sent to the rentalsman’s office Monday, March 10th she stated in part:...","This was an appeal from a Supreme Court decision dismissing certiorari applications to quash three orders of the Labour Relations Board ordering the appellant to reinstate the respondents and pay them compensation for dismissing them due to their support of a union.
The appellant alleged that the Board's order should be quashed because it failed to give reasons for its decision.
Allowing the appeal and remitting the matter for rehearing,
that there is an implied duty on a tribunal to provide written reasons whenever substantial issues are involved and the reasons for the tribunal's decision are not obvious from a review of the issues and the record.
In this case, the order of the Board imposed significant financial liability on the appellant, and the issues were complex and the concerns of the parties were substantial.
As a result, the Board acted in a patently unreasonable manner in giving its decision without providing reasons.","[3, 5, 0, 1, 7, 4, 10, 6]"

QUEEN’S BENCH FOR SASKATCHEWAN Citation: 2011 SKQB 386 Date: 2011 10 17 Docket: Q.B.G.
The issue before the hearing officer concerned the tenants’ claim for damages and return of the security deposit arising out of the landlord’s notice to vacate.
Introduction[2] David and Thelma Huntley (the “tenants”) were given written notice to vacate their apartment unit on December 3, 2010 for a December 31st termination date.
The tenants reluctantly accepted termination even though it was short notice, and thereafter applied under the Act for the return of their security deposit and other damages.
[3] A hearing was convened on May 18, 2011 at which time the hearing officer heard evidence from the tenants, the landlord’s caretaker, and considered the written submissions of the owner, George Pantazopoulos.
The tenants testified to difficulties encountered by them with an end of December move.
Thelma Huntley is elderly and David (her son) had work commitments taking him out of town for five weeks commencing in January.
David’s evidence was summarized by the hearing officer as follows: “The tenant stated that the move was a nightmare and expense due to short notice.
They were advised not to use the bathroom.","An appeal of conviction on a charge of dangerous driving on the grounds the trial judge erred in holding that statements made by the appellant were not made pursuant to the Highway Traffic Act and therefore admissible in the criminal proceedings; and in holding the statements could have been made simply because the appellant wished to have his description of the accident presented to the police and therefore were voluntary and admissible.
The defence at the voir dire was that the statement by the accused that he was the driver of the vehicle was given pursuant to the compulsion of a statute, s 83 of the Highway Traffic Act, and as such was not a 'voluntary' statement.
Arguments during trial were based upon the application of common law principles of voluntariness.
HELD: The appeal was allowed, the conviction set aside and a new trial ordered.
During the appeal it was recognized that the question of voluntariness raised a s7 Charter issue which was not raised in the trial nor in the notice of appeal.
Objections to the admissiblilty of the accused's statements based upon the Charter raise a different issue and considerations from the application of common law principles and a different conclusion may have been reached.","[1, 0, 4, 6, 8, 2, 11, 7, 5, 14, 9]"

[2] On the last two counts, each was sentenced to one year less a day to be served in the community on each count, to be served concurrently, plus a 10 year fire arms prohibition.
On the first count, each was sentenced to serve one year, in the community, consecutive to the sentences for the other counts.
They were also made subjects to DNA orders and there was an order of forfeiture of a vehicle belonging to a third party.

These are those reasons.
The respondents were involved in this activity for at least 8 ½ months, from November 15, 2005 to August 2, 2006, when they were arrested.","Plaintiff applied for an order pursuant to s.55 of the AAIA requiring SGI to pay to the plaintiff the amount awarded to her in an earlier judgment.

A car-pedestrian accident occurred causing personal injury to the plaintiff.
The defendant was convicted of dangerous driving under the Criminal Code.
The plaintiff sued for battery and assault.
The defendant was noted for default on this claim and the damages were assessed at $37,717.35, $10,000 of which were punitive.
The plaintiff submits that s.102 of the Act should not deprive a citizen of the right to sue a defendant for injuries caused by assault, battery, fraud, or similar torts.

The plaintiff was precluded by s.102 of the Act from commencing a valid legal action with the result that the judgment obtained is a nullity.

The applicant's husband had given her personal letters, records and documents to his solicitor in 1995.
These documents were relevant to a defamation action brought by her children or their spouses.
The applicant argued that a fiduciary relationship was created when the documents were accepted which was close enough to a solicitor-client retainer to give rise to a need for confidentiality and that the public's confidence in the administration of justice would be undermined if any member of that law firm acted for the plaintiffs.

for the plaintiff (applicant) Donald Beveridge for the defendants (respondents) JUDGMENT ALLBRIGHT J. December 23, 2005[1] On February 8, 2005, the plaintiff commenced an action against the defendants seeking various items of specific relief and costs on a solicitor‑client basis.
Thereafter, the plaintiff brought a notice of motion dated February 8, 2005, seeking from the Court an order that the defendants provide an accounting in relation to specified items.
This order was consented to by counsel for the defendants.
[2] The defendants filed a statement of defence on March 7, 2005, and in paragraph 8 thereof pled the following:8.
[3] The plaintiff then brought a notice of motion returnable in Chambers on July 19, 2005, seeking the following relief:1.
The amended notice of motion also seeks an order pursuant to Rules 217, 173(e) and the inherent jurisdiction of the Court striking the statement of defence of all the defendants.
To that end, the plaintiff asserts a number of grounds as the basis for making such an order.","The defendant obtained a tender to bank, blend and load coal at the plaintiff's coal preparation plant.
In performing the contract, the defendant experienced equipment problems resulting in the plaintiff having to rent equipment from the defendant's predecessor.
The plaintiff terminated the contract without any prior warning or notice to the defendant and brought an action for reimbursement of monies advanced under the contract and expenses incurred for the equipment rentals.
The defendant counter-claimed for damages arising out of the termination of the contract, for services performed under the contract and for extras which had not been paid.
Plaintiff entitled to reimbursement for overpayments and equipment rentals; defendant entitled to fair and reasonable compensation for extras for which court awarded the sum of $10,000.
Both parties were in breach of the contract, the plaintiff's breach occurring because the volumes of coal supplied did not approximate the tonnages represented in the contractual documents.
The clause excluding liability for errors in the forecast did not excuse the plaintiff because the actual volumes were not even approximate to the forecasted tonnages and the rates bid by the defendant were directly related to the anticipated tonnages.
Absent evidence as to how the plaintiff arrived at the information used in the calculation of the forecasted tonnages, no negligent misrepresentation could be found, as there was no evidence that the information was negligently obtained.
In respect to claims where on the evidence there was a loss, but it was difficult, if not impossible to quantify, damages were awarded even where it could be said the amount is a matter of guesswork.","[8, 7, 10, 3, 5, 0, 1, 14, 2, 4, 13]"

Introduction [1] These appeals concern a referendum on the question of whether the University of Saskatchewan Students’ Union should join the Canadian Federation of Students (the “Federation”).
[2] The referendum was held in the fall of 2005.
A majority of students voted in favour of joining the Federation.
[3] The Federation and the Students’ Union now seek to overturn that order.
They argue Mr. Mowat had no standing to bring his application and that the Chambers judge made errors in his approach to the application of the relevant statutory provisions.
[4] I conclude, for the reasons set out below, that the appeals must be dismissed.
II.
Background [5] The Students’ Union governs undergraduate student affairs at the University.
It is incorporated pursuant to the Act.
[6] The Federation is an incorporated entity.
[7] Membership in the Federation and Federation-Services is governed by their bylaws.
It must then conduct a referendum on the question of whether it should become a full member.
In this regard, the bylaws provide for the establishment of a Referendum Oversight Committee consisting of two members appointed by the local student association and two members appointed by the Federation.
The Oversight Committee establishes the rules governing the referendum.
[8] In November of 2004, the Council of the Students’ Union passed a motion pursuant to which the Students’ Union obtained prospective membership in the Federation and Federation-Services.","The Crown appealed a conditional sentence of 2 years less a day imposed after the respondent pled guilty to three break and enters of dwelling houses and theft and possession of stolen property in February and March as well as two breaches of undertakings in March and June 2000.
HELD: The conditional provision was removed as time spent on electronic monitoring and post sentence efforts were considered.
A conditional sentence was not available in the circumstances.
The 38 year old had 49 prior convictions.
The sentencing judge noted the accused's 3.5 years of sobriety, community support, education and technical trade training, and positive pre-sentence report but failed to consider the gravity of the offences, the need for deterrence, and above all, protection of the public.
The respondent had no sooner finished parole than he began to commit these crimes.","[5, 8, 10, 3, 4, 6, 13, 14, 11, 18, 9, 12, 20, 22, 23, 21]"
470,"Counsel: Robert G. Kennedy, Q.C.
I.
Introduction[1] This appeal arises from a dispute between the appellant, Dr. Carlos Huerto and the respondent, Government of Saskatchewan, over the payment for medical services provided by Dr. Huerto to his patients.
[2] Over a period of approximately 10 years, the Government withheld payment in relation to what eventually amounted to some 12,000 of Dr. Huerto’s accounts.
It did so by using a particular billing code which indicated, in effect, that the accounts would not be paid until further information was provided.
[3] Dr. Huerto believed the Government’s use of the billing code was unlawful and chose not to provide additional information.
With one small exception, the claim was dismissed on the basis that the action was premature.
[4] Dr. Huerto appeals from the Queen’s Bench ruling.
The Government cross-appeals in relation to the limited aspect of the case in which Dr. Huerto enjoyed success at trial.
[5] I conclude, for the reasons set out below, that both the appeal and the cross-appeal must be dismissed.
The Legal Framework[6] In order to resolve this appeal it is necessary to understand the broad outline of the scheme which governs payment for physician services in Saskatchewan.
In this regard, s. 18(2) of The Saskatchewan Medical Care Insurance Act, R.S.S.","The Crown sought leave to appeal a conditional sentence of 9 months of time served plus 2 years less 1 day, including 3 months on electronic monitoring, and 2 years probation with a 10 year firearm prohibition on each charge to be served concurrently.
The sentence was imposed for robbery with threats of violence contrary to s.348(1)(b) and s.334(2) of the Criminal Code which were committed in March 2000 while the accused was on probation.
The appellant and co-accused were convicted of breaking and entering a private residence.
The accused took $25 from the premises and held the 68 year old victim while the co-accused went to look for a knife after threatening to cut off his fingers.
The following day the two accused used threats of violence while robbing a pharmacy and a witness testified the accused yelled to the co-accused to kill the victims.
The co-accused who was convicted of assault received 7 years in prison for the robbery concurrent with 5 years for the B &amp; E. The 23 year old aboriginal who had a Grade 3 education had a prior record of 42 criminal convictions including eight violent or weapons related offences.
HELD: Leave was granted.
The appeal was allowed.
The sentence of 4 years in prison on each charge to be served concurrently took into account time served on remand and electronic monitoring.
The sentence was demonstrably unfit and fell outside the range of sentences previously imposed.
The sentencing judge relied solely on the principle of rehabilitation, essentially ignoring the other sentencing principles including the level of gravity, the principle of deterrence, the need to denounce such acts, the sentence imposed on the co-accused, and the need to protect the public.
A sentencing circle was inappropriate given the level of violence, his risk to re-offend, his consistent ignoring or refusal to follow court orders, and the fact that a penitentiary term was called for in such circumstances.
He had violated various forms of community release orders including bail and probation 16 times.
He had a history of drug and alcohol abuse and had not attended treatment.","[7, 9, 12, 10, 1, 3, 4, 6, 18, 11, 15, 5]"
471,"[1] This appeal stems from proceedings under The Family Property Act, S.S.1997, c. F- 6.3, initiated by Deborah Ruskin, a nurse, against Leith Dewar, a doctor.
The two had lived together for several years.
She sought judgment distributing their property or its value equally between them.
[2] He contended the value of the house was exempt from distribution because he had acquired it before the commencement of the spousal relationship between the parties.
Alternatively, he contended the gift and loans served to reduce the value available for distribution.
[3] The trial judge disagreed.
With that, Dr. Dewar appealed, saying the trial judge had erred in both respects.
[4] Whether the trial judge erred in either respect is best considered in light of the material facts, the relevant provisions of The Family Property Act, and the distribution made by the trial judge.
That will serve to identify the issues and set the stage for their analysis.
I.
The Material Facts[5] The parties, both of whom then resided in Vancouver, met in the summer of 1991 and began dating.
[15] At trial she sought to have the property owned by each of the parties, or its value, distributed equally between them.","FIAT. The plaintiff sought an order pursuant to Queen's Bench Rules 344 and 388 directing the manner in which monies paid into court pursuant to garnishee summonses and other monies should be distributed between the parties.
He requested two 1999 orders be amended to the extent necessary to give the relief requested.
The brothers had been involved in a dispute over the division of farming assets since July 1999.
A third party commenced legal action in QB No.3510/99 against the brothers and garnisheed revenues from the Pregnant Mare Urine operation for approximately 1 year.
The brother's application for an injunction to permit him to take over the operation was dismissed in the January 12, 2001 fiat.
His application to set aside the garnishee summonses was granted and all sums paid into court and interest were to be returned subject to provisions in fiat QB No.2259/99.
The plaintiff alleged the breach of conditions in the previous orders entitled him to bring this application.
HELD: The application was dismissed with costs of $750 payable forthwith.
The plaintiff was essentially asking the court to sit on appeal.
The orders were clear.","[8, 4, 11, 6, 13, 2, 10, 7, 3, 12, 14, 44]"
472,"The company was dissatisfied with the Assessor’s determination of fair value and appealed the assessment to the local Board of Revision, then to the Assessment Appeals Committee of the Saskatchewan Municipal Board.
The appeals were allowed in part, but the company remained dissatisfied.
So it applied for leave to appeal to this Court under section 33.1 of The Municipal Board Act, S.S. 1988-89 c. M-23.2.
It obtained leave to appeal on several grounds alleging error of law on the part of the Committee.
All relate to the determination of the fair value of the building and, more particularly, to the market adjustment factor used in that determination.
[2] The City Assessor determined the fair value of the building by the replacement cost method prescribed by The Saskatchewan Assessment Manual.
This method was described as follows by Sherstobitoff J.A.
in Cadillac Fairview Corp. v. Saskatoon (City), 2000 SKCA 84 (CanLII), [2000] 11 W.W.R.
10 The market adjustment factor, or MAF, is intended to modify what would otherwise be a ""fair value"" derived alone from replacement cost, less depreciation.
[4] Document 4.1.6 requires an assessor, when determining market adjustment factors by the sales comparison method, to “determine…the sale price” pertaining to the sale of comparable properties.","FIAT. After a decree nisi of foreclosure had issued but before expiration of the redemption period, one of the defendant registered owners (the former husband) applied for judicial sale of the matrimonial home.
The joint owners separated in 1999 and are involved in an acrimonious family law court action.
The wife has exclusive possession of the property.
The Credit Union as first mortgagee opposed the application.
The co-owner did not participate.
HELD: The application was dismissed.
1)This is not the proper forum to attempt to affect a family property settlement.
The husband was not entitled in these proceedings to a possession order.
The wife prevented every attempt to show the property to prospective owners.
There was no reason to assume she will be any more cooperative with a court appointed realtor.
The Credit Union did not request immediate possession.
2)The court's entitlement to order a judicial sale at any stage of foreclosure proceedings before a final decree issues is no longer questionable.
The court reviewed the history of the statutory authority for a judicial sale in a mortgage foreclosure proceedings.
The 1852 Chancery Procedure Amendment Act was repealed in 1881 and replaced by Ordinance 51, Rule 1, which became law in the NWT by virtue of the Judicature Ordinance No.6 of 1893.
It is now found in s.70 of the Queen's Bench Act in its modified form.
Deciding whether it is 'necessary or expedient' within the meaning of s.70 of the Queen's Bench Act is, however, a judicial exercise.","[7, 8, 4, 6, 3, 5, 9, 10, 24, 15]"

With respect, I am unable to agree.
I see no basis for setting aside the decision of Justice Maher, who on a variation application ordered the appellant (father) to pay his proportionate share of six of eleven extracurricular activities which the children were registered in and participated in at the time the application was made.
The background information is set out in the reasons of Justices Smith and Maher.
[2] In the respondent’s variation application, she requested an increase in the basic child support payment, including retroactive child support, and a determination of the eligible expenses and proportionate share of s. 7 expenses that each party should pay.
Concurrently, the appellant applied for specified changes in the parenting arrangement.
[3] On the evidence before him, the Chambers judge was satisfied the increase in income of the appellant, since the date of the consent order, constituted a material change of circumstance.
He concluded the appellant’s income was $147,000 and the respondent’s income was $53,744.68.
Maher J. ordered the appellant to pay basic Guidelines child support of $2,532 per month.","The mother of a child applied to have the court set aside its decision granting permanent care and custody of the child to the Agency.

[1] This case concerns the fixture financing provisions of The Personal Property Security Act, 1993, S.S. 1993, c. P-6.2 (“PPSA”).
The respondent Gari Holdings Ltd. claims damages from the appellant Langham Credit Union Ltd.
The claim arises from the Credit Union’s delay in removing from Gari’s land a quonset in which the Credit Union held a security interest.
The trial judge found in favour of Gari and awarded damages on the basis that the Credit Union became a tenant at sufferance of Gari when it failed to remove the quonset and therefore was obliged to pay rent.
[2] In order to resolve this appeal it is necessary to consider whether the PPSA precludes a claim by a land owner against a financer arising from the financer's failure to remove a fixture within a commercially reasonable time after giving notice of its intentions in that regard.
If that issue is decided in Gari’s favour, it will also be necessary to consider the merits of the specific claims advanced by Gari against the Credit Union.
I.
Facts[3] Gari leased a vacant lot (“the Property”) in Nipawin to Lakeland Leisure Products Ltd.
Prior to the Building being constructed, Lakeland granted a security interest in it to a financing company.
That interest was then assigned to the Credit Union and registered in the Personal Property Registry.","The defendant applied to have evidence found during a search of his premises excluded on the basis that the search warrant was invalid.

Kivela”), against his employer the City.
[2] The grounds of appeal in respect of the City are as follows.
➢ The Tribunal erred in law in ruling that Mr. Kivela made his complaint within the Code’s limitation period.
➢ The Tribunal erred in law in failing to recognize the legal significance of Mr. Kivela’s resignation from his employment with the City.
[4] During oral argument it became clear that the main issues on the appeal were the duty to accommodate and the alleged resignation of Mr. Kivela.
[5] Both the City and CUPE take issue with certain findings of fact made by the Tribunal.
Here the appeal from the Tribunal is only on a question of law (s. 32 of the Code).
By inference this denies the existence of any appeal on a question of fact.

127 of 2003, J.C. of Melfort Heard: November 1, 2007 Disposition: Appeal Dismissed Reasons By: The Honourable Mr. Justice Cameron for the Court CAMERON J.A.
The action arose out of burns suffered by the appellant while participating in a demolition derby run by the Bjorkdale Lions Club with the assistance of the Bjorkdale Fire Department.
In consequence, she dismissed the action, with costs to the respondents.
[2] The appellant then brought this appeal, contending that Justice Rothery had erred in granting the motion to withdraw the case from the jury.
Alternatively, the appellant contended that she had erred in her award of costs.
So, the issue reduces to whether she applied the test correctly in light of the evidence.
[4] The evidence adduced by the appellant may be taken for the purposes at hand to have established the following, though it may be noted that there were a number of inconsistencies and weaknesses in the evidence, especially in the testimony of the appellant.
[5] The appellant was an experienced demolition derby participant, assisted by a four-man pit crew.
[6] While participating in the demolition derby in issue, the appellant suffered burns of varying degree to various parts of his body.","The deceased made a Will appointing her only son, the appellant, as executor.
In her Will, she left her home to her son, and divided the rest and residue between her two daughters, the respondents.
The deceased transferred title to her house to the names of herself and the appellant jointly.
She also transferred some bank deposits totalling approximately $57,000 into the joint names of herself and the appellant and designated him as the person entitled to receive payments under a RRIF totalling approximately $29,000.
After her death, the appellant took the position that the bank deposits and the proceeds of the RRIF did not pass under the Will but were given to him for the benefit of the deceased's grandchildren and himself.
He paid out about $45,000 to the grandchildren and himself, but nothing to his sisters, the residuary beneficiaries under the Will.
The sisters brought action against him, claiming the funds were part of the residue of the estate and obtained a judgment to that effect against him.
He appeals against that judgment.
HELD: Appeal dismissed with costs.
 1) Section 75 of The Queen's Bench Act does not apply to this case. 2)
The trial judge carefully reviewed the evidence and the law respecting the presumption of advancement and the presumption of resulting trust.
The judge did not mention the possibility of and express trust in favour of the grandchildren.
She must have considered whether an express trust existed because that was exactly what the appellant's evidence suggested and exactly what the trial judge rejected in her findings of fact.
Since the funds in question were not given to the appellant as a gift, and were not given to him in trust for the grandchildren, they must of necessity revert to the estate.
In the case of the bank deposits, the funds would revert to the estate on the basis of a resulting trust.
In the case of the RRIF, the funds would revert to the estate on a different basis.
Since there was no gift to the appellant, and no trust in favour of the grandchildren, the monies must revert to the estate.
3) While the appellant characterized this issue as being one of mixed law and fact, it was essentially one of fact alone, the issue was what the deceased intended when she transferred the bank deposits and designated the payee of the RRIF.
The standard of review in respect of such an issue is palpable and overriding error.
The judge made no such error.
 4) The appellant asked for relief pursuant to s. 57 of The Trustee Act in respect of the money paid by him to the grandchildren.
The appellant says he paid the monies to the grandchildren in the honest belief that he was carrying out the wishes of the deceased.
The appellant knew from the outset that his sisters disagreed with his position and intended to take proceedings against him.
The appellant's actions in distributing the funds without at least getting directions from the Court were imprudent for a trustee.
The circumstances do not justify, on any equitable basis, compelling the innocent respondents to bear the loss to them occasioned by the trustee's imprudence","[1, 7, 2, 5, 3, 8, 9, 11, 13, 15, 12]"

[1] This is an appeal from a judgment in which the trial judge held that the sale of farm land by the then 79-year-old appellant was valid and that her solicitor in the transaction was not negligent.
[2] The appellant sought below to set aside the transaction under various heads of contract law including duress, undue influence, unconscionability, equitable fraud and mistake.
[3] The facts briefly are that the appellant, a widow, agreed to sell four quarters of farmland, including a residence and some grain bins on the land, to the respondents, the Clements, by a lease option agreement.
There was no interest.
[4] However, the appellant was permitted to reside in the house for her lifetime if she paid the utilities and the property taxes until December 31, 2006.
[5] It is not necessary for us to comment on the analysis the trial judge did of each of the potential attacks to the validity of the contract as against the Clements.
The issues raised in the grounds of appeal are factual and the sole matter of significance before us was whether the standard of review in H.L.","Fulltext of judgment follows:[1]
It will not be necessary for us to hear from the respondent.
The appellant has failed to persuade us that Mr. Justice Koch erred in any material respect.
In other words, we see no tenable basis for interfering with his decision.
[2] The debtor clearly committed an act of bankruptcy under ss. 42(1)(e) of the Bankruptcy and Insolvency Act, R.S.C. 1985, c. B-3, as a result of the sheriff's return of nulla bona to the respondent's writ of execution against the debtor.
[3] That left Justice Koch to consider whether to dismiss the petition pursuant to ss. 43(7) of the Act or to stay proceedings on the petition pursuant to ss. 43(11).
[4] As for the first, the debtor did not satisfy Justice Koch that he was able to pay his debts or that there existed other sufficient cause to dismiss the petition.
Based on the evidence adduced by the debtor, we are of the view there is no basis to conclude that Mr. Justice Koch should have been satisfied of these matters.
[5] As for second, concerning ss. 43(11), we note that the subsection contains discretionary power to stay proceedings.
That, of course, serves to narrow the basis for intervention on appeal.
We cannot say Justice Koch erred in any requisite respect in the exercise of this discretionary power.

[3] The respondent argues that there was no error of law nor unreasonable finding of fact by the trial judge, and that his conclusions are not so clearly wrong as to make the decision unreasonable.
[4] The trial judge found that the appellant admitted owing $1,685.86 to the respondent who accepted that amount as being the correct quantum of his counterclaim; judgment was given to the respondent for that amount.
There is no issue taken about that part of the judgment.

They also agree that the subsection is a right of first refusal clause.
It is clear that the subject matter of the clause is a 'Participating Interest in the Program Land or a Project Area'.
HELD: Appeal dismissed orally.
The appellant relies on the words in parenthesis 'the Parties being absolutely prohibited from selling, assigning, transferring, conveying or otherwise disposing of any interest other than all of part of its Participating Interest' to establish its case that the voting agreement contravenes the terms of the joint venture agreement.
However, subsection 14.01, with the words in parenthesis deleted, creates a complete right of first refusal.
In our view, the words in parenthesis, rather than being intended to create substantial new contractual obligations, were intended, as is buttressed by the parenthetical structure, merely to recall to the parties their dedication of assets to the joint venture, and their inability to dispose of them qua separate assets.
Thus, the phrase in parenthesis is mere surplusage in that it does not add or subtract substantively to subsection 14.01 or the joint venture agreement as a whole.

October 16, 2001[1] It had been established that these two matters would be tried together and there are no substantive differences between the cases on the issues that determine the rights and obligations of the parties.

[3] There are two contracts that play in this case:0 The contract between the City of Regina and Triple P Holdings operated by the defendants;0 The contract of January 21, 1997, between the respective plaintiffs in each action and the same two defendants in each action.
[4] The plaintiffs have constructed their cases in reliance upon the overall affect of both contracts with specific emphasis on the contract of January 21, 1997.","DIGEST
The appellants were convicted of several offences pursuant to the Health of Animals Act and Regulations resulting from their handling of elk and from obstructing inspectors.
The total sentence imposed by the trial judge was $69,000.
HELD: 1)
The sentencing judge was aware that the appellants had been previously convicted in 1990 of transporting wildlife without the prescribed documents.
The sentencing judge determined that the fines must be sufficient to deter the appellants and the general public.
The sentencing judge was also aware that the appellants are leaders in the elk industry.
This is a factor that would require a sufficient fine to set an example for others in the industry and within the appellants' community.
 2) In this case of fifteen convictions, the maximum fines prescribed are $750,000.
The total fine of $69,000 for placing elk in danger and for obstructing inspectors cannot be considered disproportionately high.
Given the need for the sentencing judge to address deterrence in a public welfare statute, the court could not find the sentence was 'demonstrably unfit'.
Oppositely, it is both appropriate and fit.
3) Other than varying the default provisions to the statutory default times outlined in s. 734(8) of the Criminal Code, this appeal is dismissed.","[0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 7, 8, 9, 6, 13, 10, 12]"

(orally)[1] This is an appeal from a dismissal of an application to quash the decision of Arbitrator Ish interpreting an agreement entered into between the appellant and respondent.
[2] The judgment centered on a clause governing retroactivity of pay: NOTE ON RETROACTIVITY All employees on staff at September 3, 1999 shall be eligible for retroactive wage adjustments based on all paid hours with any employer.
Employees who have retired from any employer during the term of the agreement shall be eligible for retroactive wage adjustments based on all paid hours up to and including the date of retirement.
[Collective Agreement January 1, 1998 to March 31, 2001 at p. 67]The respondent suggested, and the arbitrator accepted, that the phrase “any employer” referred to the employer for whom the employee was working on September 3, 1999.","The accused applies for relief pursuant to the Charter on the basis of post-charge delay denying her the right to have her trial in a reasonable time.
HELD: There was a Charter breach and the appropriate remedy is a stay of proceedings.
 1) The length of delay in this case from the date of charge to the date of trial is approximately 31 months.
The Supreme Court proposed as a general guideline a delay of 8 to 10 months in Provincial Court as acceptable.
This is consistent with the reality in Buffalo Narrows, where trials are set within 6 months of entering a plea. 2) 12 months of the delay can be attributed to the accused.
6 months was deducted from the delay for inherent time requirements in arranging for the accused's appearance in Court.
The remaining delay of 13 months is either attributable to the Crown or caused by factors outside the control of the accused.
3) In this case the accused has suffered actual prejudice in that the delay in bringing this matter to Court from the time of swearing the Information to the date of trial has prejudiced the accused's ability to make full answer and defence and her right to a fair trial.
While the restrictions on employment opportunities caused some prejudice, this could have been overcome by applications to amend her conditions of release.
4) There have been four trial dates set on these charges, resulting in a lengthy delay to a verdict being reached.
No explanation is offered for the adjournments except for the last adjournment caused by bad weather.","[1, 3, 2, 0, 4, 5, 6]"

As of September 2007, the petitioner has arrears of about $2,900.
He now applies to set his child support obligation and deal with the arrears.
The petitioner claims he has been paying too much in child support under the Guidelines.
HELD: 1)
In terms of ongoing support, it is appropriate to determine the petitioner's income on the basis of the three year average of his employment income being $21,834 and add to that the $5,100 in rental income for a total of $26,934.
The petitioner is actively engaged in farming.
He pursues reasonable off farm income.
In the absence of something further, the Court was not prepared to impute income.
He shall pay child support of $221 per month.
 2) In terms of the payor's ability to pay at the time the arrears accrued, the petitioner says he was paying in excess of his legal obligation.
It is true that if one looked to his employment income the table amount would be approximately half of the $300 per month non-taxable that the petitioner agreed to pay back in 1992.
However, one cannot ignore the fact that he agreed to pay it.
He did nothing to seek to change this obligation in all of the intervening years.
The petitioner's farming operation affords the petitioner an opportunity to manage his financial affairs.
By reporting a farm loss each year, the petitioner in fact pays less tax on his employment income than he would otherwise pay.
In the circumstances the Court was not prepared to rescind any of the arrears.","[1, 2, 0, 6, 4, 9, 8, 11, 13, 12, 7, 16, 15, 20, 18, 21, 17, 14, 19, 28, 31, 27, 25, 34, 33, 38, 10, 36, 24, 23, 26, 45, 44, 22, 37, 30, 52, 29]"

2 as described in that order.","The corollary relief judgment provided that the parties would share parenting of their two children approximately equally.
Child support would be based on the difference between what each party would otherwise have paid if the shared custody arrangement had not been in effect.
The wife now applied to have the amount paid by the husband increased due to his increase in income and a decline in her income.
Following the divorce, the wife had opened her own business which only produced negligible income and in each of the past four years, she had withdrawn between $10,000 and $14,000 from her RRSP, which amounts she argued should be not considered when calculating her contribution to the children's support.
She also sought to have the court go back to when the parties first separated to have the husband pay any deficiency which the court might find.
The husband requested that the court impute income to the wife on the basis that she was intentionally underemployed by continuing to operate a business that failed to produce a reasonable level of income.
Application granted in part; monthly amount of child support payable by the husband is increased based on his increased income; the wife's RRSP income was considered in the calculation of child support as it had been a recurring income figure over the past four years; no income imputed to the wife but if she could not draw a reasonable level of income from the business within the next year, it would be open to the court to reconsider this issue.
Given that the previous variation order was a consent order and both parties had legal counsel at the time and had not appealed that order, the court was not prepared to retroactively vary its terms.","[1, 2, 3, 0, 7, 5, 9, 12, 8, 4, 16, 17, 13, 15]"

2402IN THE QUEEN'S BENCH PROVINCE OF SASKATCHEWAN IN BANKRUPTCYIN THE MATTER OF THE BANKRUPTCY OF BRENT ASHTONBETWEEN:THOMAS BURKE MOODY, PATRICK MOODY and DARREL MOODY PETITIONERS- and -BRENT ASHTON RESPONDENT J.M.
FACTSThe Petitioners are three brothers from the District of Perdue, Saskatchewan who carry on a family farm operation and who operate a family-owned farm implement dealership business.
In 1985, the accountant for the Petitioners was Lorne Broten of the Saskatoon accounting firm of Chamberlain, Broten & McKenzie.
Mr. Broten recommended to the Petitioners that they become involved in certain real estate partnerships, in order to derive certain tax advantages.
Relying upon Mr. Broten's advice, the Petitioners invested in these partnerships.
The two real estate partnerships in which the Petitioners invested were known as ""Key West Carleton"" and ""KW Properties"" (""the Partnerships"").
The acquisition and operation of the Properties by the Partnerships have been financed by various lenders (""the Lenders""), including Royal Bank of Canada and Federal Business Development Bank.
In order to obtain waivers of The Limitation of Civil Rights Act, R.S.S.
1978, c. L-16, in respect of the Mortgages, the Lenders have required that title to the Properties be held in the name of various nominee corporations controlled by the Partnership.","FIAT: The applicant seeks an order setting aside a wage assessment certificate issued by the Director of the Labour Standards Branch (the Director) and filed with this Court.
The applicant disputes liability for the amount set out in the wage assessment and claim that he inadvertently and innocently missed the time within which to file an appeal.
The issues are whether this Court has jurisdiction to set aside the Director's certificate filed with the Court of Queen's Bench, if so what criteria ought to be applied in determining whether the Court should exercise its discretion and whether the applicant has satisfied the criteria.
HELD: 1) Even though an appeal from a wage assessment to the appeals board and an appeal from an adjudicator to the Court of Queen's Bench both require 'appeals' within '21 days', an appeal to the Court of Queen's Bench is a true appeal while an 'appeal' to the appeals board is essentially a request for a de novo hearing.
Consequently, this Court concludes that the consequences of missing the time limitation are not necessarily the same.
2) This Court does have jurisdiction to deal with an applicant's request, on a director appeal, because it is not a 'true appeal' that questions a decision made by an independent adjudicator after a hearing.
Accordingly, the reasoning of this Court in Farmers of North America Inc. v. Langridge, 2004 SKQB 375, is not applicable.
A finding that this Court is without jurisdiction to set aside a judgment, obtained without any independent adjudicative process, regardless of the basis upon which that judgment was obtained, is inequitable and at odds with existing practices and procedures.
Section 62.4(4) of The Labour Standards Act states that a certificate filed pursuant to s. 62.4(3) has the same force and effect as if it were a judgment obtained in the Court of Queen's Bench for the recovery of a debt.
This Court certainly would have jurisdiction to determine whether or not the applicant's application to open up a noting for default should be granted pursuant to Rule 114(3), Rule 271 and Rule 346.
It follows that this Court is able to look behind the filing and examine the circumstances under which that judgment was entered.
The Court of Queen's Bench is a superior Court charged with the administration of justice and enjoys inherent as well as statutory jurisdiction.
This inherent jurisdiction cannot be removed by either level of government without constitutional amendment.
3) It is fair and equitable to apply, by analogy, the principles and resulting rules formulated relating to opening up a default judgment to the applicant's request to set aside the judgment registered in circumstances where he has failed to file an appeal disputing a wage assessment to the registrar of appeals.
 4) The evidence is that the applicant is a businessman running a commercial enterprise in Foam Lake.
It is expected that somebody in his position would have the savvy to read, review and understand the document, or at least seek assistance from someone who could help him.
The applicant either failed or declined to read, or chose to ignore, the plain language of the documents served on him by registered mail.
This amounts to wilful blindness at the very least.
Numerous cases hold that wilful blindness is not sufficient reason to set aside a noting for default.
In these circumstances the Court is not prepared to exercise its discretion in favour of setting aside the Director's certificate filed as a judgment of this Court.","[0, 5, 6, 7, 4, 3, 1, 12, 10, 13]"

for the appellant Ms. Catherine A. Sloan for the respondent Mr. Neil R. McLeod for the Intervenor, Sask.
Introduction[1] Two female employees of Cadillac Fairview Corporation Ltd., a unionized employer, filed complaints with the Saskatchewan Human Rights Commission alleging sexual harassment and discrimination in their employment contrary to The Saskatchewan Human Rights Code.
[1] The Code prohibits an employer from discriminating against an employee on the basis of sex.
Subsequent to the employee’s complaints, a Board of Inquiry was appointed under the Code to investigate the alleged discrimination.
[2] Cadillac Fairview contends the Code has no application to a complaint of sexual discrimination arising out of the employee/employer relationship governed by a collective bargaining agreement which provides for the resolution of all disputes by final and binding arbitration.
It further contends that an arbitrator appointed under the provisions of the collective agreement and s. 25(1) of the Act has exclusive jurisdiction to resolve the complaint.
The terms and conditions of their employment were governed by the terms of the collective agreements in force from time to time during their employment.
At no time did these complainants file a grievance under their collective bargaining agreement in relation to the alleged discrimination.","The action, originally filed in 2000, concerned allegations of breach of - fiduciary duty, trust, industry regulations/standards, contract; and claims of negligence and malpractice.
These claims related to the actions of an investor formerly employed by the defendant.
The matter had languished at a slow pace for many years.
The evidence showed the plaintiffs had taken three years to reply to a demand for particulars.
There was also delay when the defendant requested a change in the plaintiff's counsel (because of a conflict of interest).
The defendant applied to dismiss the plaintiffs' action, claiming want of prosecution under the Rule 28.13 of the old Civil Procedure Rules (1972), and asserting it has suffered significant prejudice as a result of the delay such that it will be impossible to properly defend the claim.
Application dismissed.
While there has been inordinate delay (eight-and-a-half-years) attributable to the plaintiffs, the defendant is also responsible for some of the delay (another two-and-a-half-years).
While the plaintiff's delay could be considered inexcusable if viewed in isolation, the defendant's contribution to the delay is not irrelevant.
There were actions on the part of the defendant that could be interpreted as acquiescing to the delay.
After considering the case law concerning the circumstances in which a presumption of prejudice will arise as a result of the passage of time, the court found no presumption of prejudice here.
On the facts, there is not a sufficient causal connection between the delay/blameworthy conduct and the prejudice.
There is a significant documentary record of the transactions.
The defendant has been in contact with its former employee and could have taken the opportunity to discover him sooner.
The defendant's failure to act to secure the evidence available to them at time mitigates the effects of the passage of time.
While there is a possibility of some prejudice should the matter proceed, the defendant has not established it will suffer serious prejudice.
Even if there was serious prejudice, the balance of convenience weighs in favour of the plaintiffs given that dismissing the action would leave them with no other recourse.","[1, 4, 0, 7, 11, 2, 8, 18, 10, 14, 6]"

The purport of the challenges are summarized as follows.
First, that the Board has no jurisdiction to issue a subpoena duces tecum or to make production orders without considering the relevance of what is sought to be produced.
[4] Third, that the Board has no jurisdiction to order the production of documents that are irrelevant to the issues that are properly before the Board.
Fourth, that the use by the Board of its powers to permit UFCW to discover documents in a “fishing expedition” for an ulterior purpose unrelated to the issues, is an abuse of process.

3 and 4 of The Public Inquiries Act, R.S.S.

It also submits that the patently unreasonable standard of review applies to the application, not the correctness standard of review.
What constitutes the record of the Board proceedings in this particular case?
What is the applicable standard of review in this case?","This is an appeal by the tenant, pursuant to s. 72 of the Residential Tenancies Act from a decision of the hearing officer appointed under the Act, who, pursuant to ss. 58, 68, and 70 of the Act, ordered that the landlord be given possession of the tenant's rental unit and that a writ of possession be issued to place the landlords in possession of the rental unit.
HELD: The Court reviewed the facts and found the tenant had not raised any true issues as to the jurisdiction of the hearing.
It was the Court's view that the hearing officer had jurisdiction to hear and determine the matter in issue.
The notice of appeal and arguments presented by the tenant all relate to the facts as found by the hearing officer and contain no error of law.

Elash on behalf of the plaintiffR.B.
Morris & P.E.
Bood on behalf of the defendantsJUDGMENT KYLE J. November 7, 1995The facts of this case are relatively simple.
When, in 1973, his son, Thomas Davidson Jr., granted an option to purchase to the plaintiff, as represented by his agent, the agreement contained the following paragraph:(11) It is understood and agreed between the Parties hereto that there are four (4) wellsites for the production of petroleum and/or natural gas located on the South Half of 14- 4-5-W2 and Roadways thereto and that all benefits and advantages and rentals and emoluments to be paid or derived pursuant to such surface leases are not being transferred to the Optionee but have been reserved by the predecessor in title of the Optionor of the Second Part and the Optionee covenants and agrees to enter into a separate agreement with the Optionor of the Second Part and with the Executors of the estate of Thomas Davidson Senior with reference to the reservation of such surface leases.
The option was exercised and a fee simple title was issued to the plaintiff in 1973.
The title was encumbered by, inter alia, caveats protecting the surface leases but there was no reference to the rent charge reserved or excluded by the option agreement.
During this period a review conducted pursuant to surface lease legislation required the consent of the landowner and the plaintiff gave that consent.","FIAT: Each of the defendants and third parties (collectively the 'applicants'), apply to stay either permanently or on an interim basis the plaintiffs' claim commenced pursuant to The Class Actions Act.
The stay applications seek the same discretionary order of the court pursuant to s. 37(1) of The Queen's Bench Act, 1998 and/or Rule 173 of the Queen's Bench Rules.
The plaintiff's action claims damages for injuries that are alleged to have been caused by the testing and application of herbicides at a Canadian Forces base in New Brunswick.
To date 11 statements of claim have been filed across Canada, 9 by Merchant Law Group (MLG).
MLG has proceeded with various stages of the class action proceeding which it has commenced through the various jurisdictions in Canada as it has considered to be to the best advantage of the plaintiffs which that firm represents or seeks to represent.
Now Saskatchewan is the clear preference.
Many of these strategic decisions are driven by the nature of state of class actions legislation in the various jurisdictions in which claims were commenced.
The applicants claim these strategic decisions are and do constitute an abuse of process.
They claim they are a costly expenditure of time and money.
The applicants have already participated in certification hearings in Newfoundland and New Brunswick.
The issue on this application is whether the Saskatchewan action should be stayed permanently or on an interim basis with or without conditions on the basis of abuse of process.
HELD: The applications to stay, on either an interim or permanent basis, the Saskatchewan action are dismissed.
1) The Court has concluded that virtually all, if not all of the concerns raised by the applicants in support of their stay applications are intended to be, and for that matter, mandated to be considered by the court during the certification application of this class action.
 'Traffic control' as between the nine or ten existing class actions commenced in the other provincial jurisdictions is the responsibility of this Court upon certification as now required by s. 6(2) and s. 6(3) of the Act.
The objectives and relevant factors by which the court is to be guided and which it must consider involve the very considerations upon which the applicants base their stay applications.
They include avoiding, where possible, the risk of irreconcilable judgments, the promotion of judicial economy, the consideration of the law applicable, the stage each action has reached, the plan for the proposed multi-jurisdictional class action and the location of the representative plaintiffs, class members, evidence and witnesses.
The discretion granted by the legislature to the court with respect to any certification orders it may issue as outlined in s. 6.1 of the Act is very broad.
That discretion must be exercised having regard to the criterion set out in s. 6(2) of the Act.
That may prompt a conclusion that deference should be given to an existing class action commenced in another jurisdiction.
The discretion of the court is further circumscribed by the objectives and relevant factors set out in s. 6(3) of the Act.
The concerns raised by the applicants in support of their stay application have been eclipsed.
They are not specifically and legislatively required to be addressed by the court at the certification stage and after a certification hearing has been conducted.
2) Even if the criteria in Englund v. Pfizer Canada Inc., 2007 SKCA 62; were to be applied to the consideration of the stay applications presently before the Court, the Court would be inclined, in any event, to dismiss the stay applications in the facts and circumstances of this case.
There are many differences between the proposed Saskatchewan class to be certified, its inclusiveness and exclusiveness, the nature of the injuries claims for, the substances alleged to have cause those injuries and the enumerated defendants or third parties in the actions commenced in each of the other jurisdictions.
That alone, without the assistance of s. 6 and the other amending provisions of the Saskatchewan Act, distinguish this case from those criteria which the Court of Appeal applied in Englund to reach the conclusion that the action should be appropriately (but conditionally) stayed.","[1, 0, 3, 5, 4, 8, 9, 2, 12, 7]"

(b) Is the loss one which is covered by insurance, within the meaning of the Lease?
(c) Did the Landlord cause or contribute to the loss?

Sole custody to the mother, with supervised access for a period of time (to reintroduce the father to the child), moving to increasingly longer periods of daytime access.
The father must complete a parenting course to better learn how to meet the child's various needs.
There was insufficient evidence to show he is unable to protect the child from her severe nut allergy.
There was insufficient evidence to establish he is a flight risk.
Even if he had threatened to flee with the child, it is relevant that he lacks the means to do so.
While there has been unpleasantness and some violence between the parties, the evidence does not establish domestic violence of a nature that would require supervised access on an ongoing basis.","[4, 6, 5, 19, 10, 20, 7, 2, 8, 17, 9, 0, 26, 22, 23, 21, 30, 15]"

INTRODUCTION[1] This is an application for judicial review of the decision of a labour arbitrator released on July 21, 2000 in respect of a grievance arbitration heard in Sydney, Nova Scotia on May 10, 2000.
The arbitration involved the interpretation of certain seniority provisions of a collective agreement between the parties which was effective on October 1, 1999 and expires on September 30, 2002.
[2] The grievor was Ms. Kathy Fraser.
She was a member of the respondent union and had been employed at the Delta Sydney hotel since 1989 in various capacities.
At the time of the grievance, she was employed in the front desk department of the hotel.
BACKGROUND[3] The essential facts surrounding this matter are not in dispute.
She recognized this when she took the job.
Her hotel seniority, of course, remained unchanged which was greater than that of each of the three above named employees.
This resulted in a reduction of the hours of work allotted to Ms. Fraser by the hotel, based on its application of the departmental seniority list under Article 14:05.
[7] Ms. Fraser considered that any reduction in work hours should instead have been predicated on hotel seniority which she held over all three of these employees in her department.","The father appealed from the decision of the Chamber's judge which varied the custody provisions of a consent judgment.
The father had been unsuccessful in arguing for a shared custody arrangement in the Court below.
The father argued that the Chamber's judge erred in her application of the best interests of the children and failed to apply the principle of maximum contact by applying a presumption in favour of the status quo and finding that the wishes of the children were irrelevant.
For the first time on appeal, the father also argued that there was insufficient uncontroverted evidence before the Chambers judge to allow her to make a proper decision.
HELD: The appeal was dismissed.
It is implicit in the Chamber's decision that there was sufficient evidence before the Court to reach a conclusion about the best interests of the children and to find a change in circumstances.
No error was made on this issue.
The Chamber's judge correctly applied the test to determine the best interests of the children as articulated in Gordon v. Goertz.
The Chamber's judge correctly concluded that the Act does not provide that the maximum contact principle alone provides a sufficient basis for ordering shared parenting.
She addressed this principle in the context of the children's best interests.
There is no evidence that the Chamber's judge stopped her inquiry at the status quo and that she did not assess the children's best interests against the proposed new circumstances and its impact upon them.
The Chamber's judge was entitled to give limited or no weight to the wishes of the children.
There is no material error or misapprehension of the evidence.","[0, 1, 8, 3, 5, 4, 6, 7, 11, 12, 16, 18]"

Partnership Agreement provided for resolution of disputes by arbitration.
Respondent sued appellant who defended, provided some documents and agreed to discovery, but refused substantive answers citing the Agreement.
More than two years after suit started, appellant applied for stay.
Issue: Did Chambers judge err in refusing stay?
Result: Leave granted but appeal dismissed.
Chambers judge did not err.
Appellant had defended and taken steps in the proceedings which precluded right to apply for stay under s. 7 of the Arbitration Act.

and Fichaud, J.A.
concurring.
At the conclusion of the hearing, the parties were advised that leave to appeal would be granted but that the appeal would be dismissed, with reasons to follow.
These are the reasons.
Clause 25 of the agreement provided that all disputes between partners relating to the business of the partnership would be arbitrated under the Arbitration Act, R.S.N.S.","Employees were entitled to wage adjustments under the collective bargaining agreement.
The plaintiff union brought an application for an interlocutory injunction requiring the defendant to pay employees who were retiring in 2010 their wage adjustments in the current calendar year.
This was an issue because it would affect pensions and retirement dates.
In the alternative, the union argued the employer should pay the entitlements before the year end on a 'best approximation' basis or be required to proceed to an expedited arbitration.
The defendant brought a motion to strike or dismiss the plaintiff's motion under Queen's Bench Rules 99 and 173 on the basis that the issues raised were terms and conditions of the employment contract and outside the jurisdiction of the Court according to the terms of the collective bargaining agreement.
HELD: The defendant's application was dismissed because the Court has residual discretionary jurisdiction to grant relief not available under a statutory arbitration scheme.
The plaintiff's application for an injunction was also dismissed.
While there may be a serious issue to be tried, the pleadings do not set forth a strong prima facie case.
While there might be some irreparable harm to some employees, in general terms the losses can be dealt with through damages.
It would be impossible for the defendant to meet a deadline two weeks away because of the complexity of the calculations.
It is not appropriate to grant an injunction requiring the defendant to make payment before the end of 2010 and it is not reasonable to make payments based on best approximation.
The Court has no jurisdiction to force arbitration on the parties.","[3, 1, 4, 2, 7, 6, 5, 8, 9, 11, 10, 17, 14, 15, 18, 20, 13]"

The application proceeded on an Agreed Statement of Facts.
Mr. Francis had made a number of assignments of book debts, some general and some specified to the various claimants.
The learned trial judge held that s. 89(1) of the Indian Act, R.S.C.

The Agreed Statement of Facts further states that payment was directed by Francis to be made to his lawyer in trust for the benefit of Eastland.
There are problems with the Agreed Statement of Facts with respect to the claims of Martin and Eastland as the actual documentation does not appear to support what the parties agreed were the facts.
CIBC did not make any representations on the appeal to this Court from Mr. Justice Edwards' decision.

There are factors that suggest there is a presumption in favor of proceeding by way of an application (Rule 6.02(3)).
The respondent failed to show that, on balance, an action is the preferable route.
While not all of the witnesses will be ascertained quickly, the important ones can be, which is all that Rule 6.03(5)(a) requires.
The hearing should be predictable in scope and length and ready to be heard within months.

[2] In the decision under appeal, Justice Wilson set out the history of the relationship between the parties and made several findings of fact respecting the residence of the appellant during the marriage and for the year prior to the commencement of the divorce proceedings.
See: 2007 NSSC 305 (CanLII).
The judge concluded that the appellant was ordinarily resident in Texas for at least seven of the twelve months prior to November 7, 2006 when the petition was filed in Nova Scotia.
The order of Justice Wilson sets aside the petition for divorce and declares that all interim orders, interlocutory orders, execution orders, and judgments in the proceeding are void.
Included in the orders declared void are interim orders giving custody of the eight year old child of the marriage to the appellant, and providing for access, child support and spousal support.
As well an order has issued releasing the respondent’s interest in the Nova Scotia matrimonial property, subject to accounting at a later date.

The applicants were partners in an architecture firm that provided design drawing and specifications for the construction of the Education Building at the University of Saskatchewan.
The building was substantially completed in 1970.
In 1985, stone panels fell off the exterior of the building.
In 1986 the respondent commenced an action against its insurer for coverage of the loss.
In 1991, the insurer commenced an action against the applicants in order to preserve the respondent's right to relief.
In 1997, the Court determined the respondent was not entitled to coverage from its insurer.
The respondent commenced control over the litigation against the applicant in 1997.
Between 1997 and 2010, documents were exchanged, discoveries were held and an unsuccessful settlement negotiation was held.
In 2010 all of the defendants applied to have the respondent's claim dismissed for want of prosecution.
The Chambers judge struck the claims against all the defendants except the applicant.
HELD: Leave to appeal was granted because there was some merit to the applicant's arguments that they had been treated inconsistently and that key witnesses were no longer available to testify because of death or mental or physical disability, which would prejudice the applicant.
Secondly, the issue of delays in litigation is important and the case will present an opportunity for the Court to clarify the legal framework pertaining to such matters.","[3, 6, 8, 4, 9, 7, 5, 10, 15, 18]"

INTRODUCTION [1] The matter before me for determination concerns the disposition review involving the respondents’ children, K.B.
born [in 1990] and C.B.
born [in 1993].
At the outset of this hearing, the Children’s Aid Society of Cape Breton Victoria (the “Agency”) sought to have its involvement terminated, while L.M.
requested the continued intervention of the Agency.
During summations, the Agency consented to its continued involvement with the child C.B., but sought the termination of its involvement with the child K.B..
The respondent, T.B.
did not participate at this disposition review, although he had participated in previous hearings.

The officer may not have drawn the presence of a telephone book to the accused's attention.
The officer dialed the number for Legal Aid duty counsel for the accused and the accused spoke with Legal Aid duty counsel prior to providing breath samples of 190 milligrams and 180 milligrams.
The accused never indicated that he wished to contact other counsel.
HELD: Following a voir dire, the accused's application to exclude evidence was dismissed.
The accused had not succeeded in establishing on a balance of probabilities that the accused's right to consult counsel under s. 10(b) of the Charter had been violated.
The accused was entirely disinterested in consulting with counsel as was his right and was clear and unequivocal in his waiver of rights to counsel.

1990, c.5.
The Minister is requesting 13 Orders of Production for records prepared by and in the possession of persons and organizations who have provided services to the Respondent.
[2] The application of this Rule first requires the court to determine whether the document “might be compelled at a hearing”.
A document that is relevant to a proceeding and not subject to exclusion is compellable.
After determining whether a document is relevant the court must determine whether the document is to be excluded, which, in the context of this proceeding requires an examination of the Respondent’s right to claim privilege in respect to the documents requested.
[5] A document to be relevant must contain material that will prove or support a fact or proposition put forward by the party seeking the document.
This provides the document’s connection to the proceeding.
It is not enough to say that a document about a party exists and therefore it must be provided.
The information in the document must relate to a fact or proposition at issue.
If there is no such relationship, the document is excluded as irrelevant.","The accused's neighbour disliked the accused and alleged that the accused drove his vehicle into hers.
The police arrested the accused and found a fob that operated the locks on the doors of the vehicle and the engine hood of the accused's vehicle was warm.
The accused was charged with hit and run and impaired driving.
HELD: The Court found the accused not guilty of both charges.
The Court found that the police breaches of the accused's Charter rights were numerous.
The approximate 11 minutes of investigative detention was not an infringement of his rights but the combination of the officers' failing to inform the accused of the reason for his arrest and not giving his rights to counsel without delay, coupled with the illegal search and seizure of the fob and keys were in total breaches serious enough to bring the administration of justice into disrepute.
The Court excluded the evidence of the fob and keys which further weakened the circumstantial case against the accused to the extent that the Crown failed to prove the accused was the operator of the motor vehicle.","[9, 4, 0, 8, 5, 18, 20, 10, 17, 19, 21]"

PUBLISHERS OF THIS CASE PLEASE TAKE NOTE THAT s. 94(1) OF THE CHILDREN AND FAMILY SERVICES ACT APPLIES AND MAY REQUIRE EDITING OF THIS JUDGMENT OR ITS HEADING BEFORE PUBLICATION.
At the conclusion of the hearing before us we indicated the appeal was dismissed with reasons to follow.
These are the reasons.
[2] The facts are scant, as acknowledged by the appellant, because the only evidence before the chambers judge was the usual documentation provided to a court with an application for an uncontested adoption.
[3] The appellant is currently 25 years old, was not married at the time of her daughter’s birth in June 2000 and remains single.","The accused was convicted of aggravated assault after stabbing another person several times in the mid-section.
The Crown brought a dangerous offender application.
The accused was 22 years old at the time of sentencing.
His prior criminal record consisted of mostly youth convictions.
The offender was a known member of an aboriginal gang.
The evidence suggested he was somewhere in the middle of the gang hierarchy.
The accused had professed some desire to leave the gang.
He had written an article directed at other youth warning them of the pitfalls of gang affiliation.
The article was published in a book distributed to at risk youth.
The accused had looked into getting help to leave the gang, but admitted on the stand that he was not prepared to take steps to leave because he might need protection from the gang in the penitentiary.
While incarcerated, he had gang drawings confiscated from him and he had been jumped by members of a rival gang while in custody.
The accused had shown some initiative in taking anger management courses and had completed his GED while incarcerated.
HELD: The offence was a serious personal injury offence within the meaning of s. 752 of the Criminal Code.
The criminal record together with the evidence heard at the hearing establishes that when the accused has committed violent offences he has been under the influence of alcohol or drugs, under supervision by court orders in the community, has used a knife or had one in his possession and most of the offences were a result of the accused's affiliation with the Indian Posse gang.
The Crown has established a pattern of repetitive behaviour within the meaning of s. 753(1)(a)(i).
Dr. Holden assessed the accused and found him to be a high risk to re-offend violently.
The Crown has also proven that the accused constitutes a threat to the life, safety, and physical or mental well-being of other persons as set out in s. 753(1)(a)(ii).
The accused was declared a dangerous offender.
However, the Court found that given the accused's youth, the fact that he had not had any of the intensive programming that is available in a federal institution and the fact that there was some chance the accused might leave the gang, a determinate sentence and long term supervision order would adequately protect the public.
In imposing a determinate sentence, the Court also considered that the accused's acts of violence, with the exception of the predicate offence, had generally resulted in less than severe injuries to the victim and the accused had voluntarily taken some steps to address his issues while incarcerated.
The accused was sentenced 6 years or 72 months in custody, less credit for remand, to be followed by a 9 year supervision order under s. 753.4(b).","[0, 1, 2, 3, 6, 8, 7, 11, 5, 14, 13, 12, 4]"

It held that although it had concurrent jurisdiction with the Federal Court regarding habeas corpus applications, it declined jurisdiction in this case to grant a remedy because habeas corpus could not be used to review a decision of CSC made within the confines of its jurisdiction.

The petitioner, on the other hand, was found to be a truthful and reliable witness.
The court was also impressed with the petitioner’s witnesses because they were close family members, long-time friends, and her live-in partner.
By contrast, the respondent’s witnesses were friends seen from time to time, neighbours, and his mother.
The court found the respondent’s mother to be evasive and guarded at times.
To determine custody the court reviewed the factors set out in s. 8 of The Children’s Law Act, 1997.
The petitioner was found to be the primary parent of the child since his birth.
The court was left with a degree of uncertainty as to the day-to-day activities of the child when he was with the respondent.
The quality of the child’s relationship with the petitioner was found to substantially exceed that of the respondent’s relationship with the child.
The court accepted that the child said disturbing things upon his return to the petitioner from the respondent.
The child’s need for a stable, reassuring, and positive home were found to be met in the petitioner’s home.
The court indicated that decreasing the respondent’s time with the child may ameliorate the adverse effect on the child’s emotional needs.
The child was also found to be afforded more social fulfillment in the petitioner’s care.
The petitioner also had more constructive plans for the child’s future.
The respondent’s negativity towards the petitioner was found to negatively impact his ability to parent.
The court concluded that it was in the child’s best interests to primarily reside with the petitioner.
The petitioner was granted sole custody of the child so as to minimize further conflict between the parties.
The respondent was given unsupervised access every other weekend.
The court added $5,000 to the petitioner’s line 150 income for the personal component of her vehicle expense deduction.
After determining the respondent’s income the court found that the s. 3 Guideline child support due by the respondent to the petitioner was $676 per month and that he should be responsible for 37 percent of the s. 7 expenses.
The petitioner did not request child support but instead asked the court to consider it in the distribution of property.
The respondent discharged the onus of establishing a common-law relationship of two or more years.
The respondent’s pension value available for division was found to be $11,663.97.
 The court did not find an extraordinary circumstance to warrant an unequal division of the family home.
The value of the home was $360,000.
The court used the date of application to determine the amount owing on the home.
The petitioner also had rental properties and was given an exemption of $90,641.43 for those properties.
After taking into consideration all of the property and exemptions, the respondent failed to prove that he was entitled to any distribution under The Family Property Act.

THE APPLICATION:[1] This is a disposition hearing under s. 41(1) of the Children and Family Services Act respecting the child, D., born [in 2003].
THE ISSUES:[2] 1.
Placement.
Consideration of parenting plans of the paternal and maternal grandmothers as to placement under the Act for the long term best interests of the child.
THE FACTS:[4] The parties agree that the child is in need of protective services.","HELD: This was an extraordinary event for all of the accused and nothing in the evidence suggested that they required rehabilitation or that incarceration would assist in rehabilitation.
The victim did not provide a victim impact statement, but the court concluded that the event would have been terrifying for him.
The gravity of the offence was high given the maximum sentence of life imprisonment.
The court found the following mitigating factors: 1) guilty pleas; 2) the event was not planned in advance, it was prompted by alcohol use; 3) the assault was serious but brief; 4) the accused were all employed and contributing members of society; 5) the accused all accepted responsibility for the offence; and 6) the accused all complied with strict release conditions for three years.
The aggravating factors were: 1) s. 348.1 of the Criminal Code was applicable to all accused even though their level of participation differed; 2) they entered the victim’s residence by breaking a window; 3) the crime was intense; 3) two of three accused had weapons and used them on the victim; and 4) the victim had some lasting injuries from losing three to four teeth.
The court was prepared to extend leniency to the accused; however, some period of incarceration was found necessary to meet the objectives of deterrence and denunciation.
A.H. was sentenced to 10 months incarceration, J.M. to 11 months incarceration, and N.F. to 12 months less a day incarceration for the break and enter charge and one year consecutive incarceration on the s. 85(2) charge.
All accused were given an 18-month probation period to follow their incarceration.
Terms of the probation included counselling as required and no contact with the victim.","[1, 0, 2, 4, 5, 7, 6, 12, 14, 3, 16, 10, 11, 19, 15, 13]"

The mother does not trust the agency's interventions because of her past experiences.
When she was a youth, the mother was in the care of the agency and resided in several foster and group homes.
[6] The child was apprehended in April 2004 because of unsafe and unhealthy living conditions in April 2004.
Only the psychological father and the 17 year old male youth were home at the time the child was taken into care.","HELD: The order was granted.
Following the expiry of the current temporary order, the court found that the children were in need of protection pursuant to s. 11 of The Child and Family Services Act.
As the father had taken no steps to deal with his anger, violence and alcohol issues, the children continued to be in need of protection as they were likely to suffer physical harm at his hands.
Their psychological well-being required that they remain in protection to allow them to deal with the trauma they had suffered while they were in his care.
Therefore, the court found that because the children were doing well in foster care and did not wish to be returned to their father and that the expert had advised against them having any further contact with him, it would make a permanent order rather than a long-term order.","[7, 10, 1, 9, 2, 5, 13, 8, 16, 15, 11, 4, 18, 14, 23, 25, 19]"

The crown, the young person and the parent argue that the conference should not be open to the public and the media.

The court found that a term permitting an appeal from an arbitrator’s decision on an error of law did not fall into the category of the obvious and was not the same as an implied term, such as that of good workmanship in contracts for repair.
The contractual language used by the parties was clear that they intended to resolve disputes by final and binding arbitration.
Even if it had found that the parties had not contracted out of s. 45(2) of the Act, the application for leave would have been dismissed because the proposed grounds of appeal did not raise a pure issue of law.","[0, 6, 3, 5, 9, 7, 10, 2, 21, 13, 12, 19, 22]"

MacDonaldPlace heard: Sydney, Nova ScotiaDate heard: December 16, 1996Decision released: January 13, 1997Counsel: Sheldon Nathanson, for the Applicant/Plaintiff MACDONALD, J:This is a Chambers Application wherein the Applicant seeks approval of the Court for a settlement reached on behalf of the infant plaintiff in this matter.
The matter was set down for hearing on December 16, 1996 and the Court was presented with the application and affidavits of Dennis Richard Costello and Sheldon Nathanson as the applicant's counsel.
A brief summary of the facts as supplied by counsel reveal as follows:On or about the first day of December, 1992, Josh Francis Costello was waiting for a school bus to pick him up outside the Balls Creek Elementary School.
Josh Francis Costello was attending the Balls Creek Elementary School which is within the district of the Cape Breton District School Board, in the County of Cape Breton, Province of Nova Scotia.
As the bus driven by William Brian MacKenzie came into sight, Josh Costello and the other children approached the usual boarding sight.
The bus pulled up to the boarding sight and stopped.
The medical reports on file indicate that the infant plaintiff suffered a crush injury to the right leg below the knee.","The accused was charged with the commission of sexual assault, sexual touching in relation to a 16-year-old and possession of child pornography.
The accused came to police attention via a report by the complainant.
She reported that the accused was often viewing a pornographic website while in her presence.
The police prepared an information to obtain a search warrant (ITO).
The ITO stated that the search would provide evidence of the accused’s viewing of pornography in the presence of the complainant, bolstering the complainant’s credibility.
The ITO did not reference possession of child pornography.
The ITO sought only a search of the “search history on the computer”.
The issued warrant authorized a search of the accused’s computer and related devices and media, as well as documents pertaining to occupancy of the home and control of computer equipment.
The complainant subsequently alleged that the accused had taken photos of her in the shower.
The police did not amend the ITO to include a search for photos.
The police executed the search and seized, inter alia, a laptop, an iPhone and CDs.
The police delivered the material to a computer forensic specialist at the RCMP and requested a complete forensic search of the computer and phone to obtain a general search of the Internet history, pictures of the complainant and messages between the complainant and the accused.
The police knew that the search of pictures was not included on the search warrant.
The RCMP did not review the terms of the warrant prior to completing the examination and examined the entire contents of the laptop and phone.
The accused submitted that his s. 8 Charter rights had been violated by the search and applied for exclusion of evidence pursuant to s. 24(2).
The application proceeded by voir dire.
The evidence was apparently located on either the accused’s laptop or cell phone, but the nature of the evidence obtained was not disclosed at the voir dire.
The following issues were raised: 1) What is the correct procedure to be used to challenge evidence seized pursuant to a search warrant; 2) Was the Crown able to call amplification evidence and have it considered in support of the search and seizure conducted; 3) Did the ITO set forth reasonable and probable grounds that the items sought were evidence with respect to the commission of an offence; 4) Did the ITO use boiler plate clauses; 5) Did the ITO establish reasonable and probable grounds that the items were likely to be found in the place to be searched; and 6) What was the extent of a search of a computer or computer device.
| HELD: Evidence of the accused’s search history was validly obtained.
Other evidence was beyond the scope of the search warrant and obtained by violation of the accused’s s. 8 rights.
The court held: 1) There is a two-step inquiry to be made when real evidence is seized during a search.
The first step is an inquiry into constitutionality, and the second is reached only after a constitutional infringement has been established.
Both inquiries impose an onus on the person claiming infringement.
The standard of proof is the balance of probabilities.
Challenges to constitutionality of warranted searches may involve either or both a facial and a sub-facial attack on the authorizing warrant.
The record examined on facial review is fixed: it is the ITO, not an amplified or enlarged record; 
2) In attempting to enter evidence of the complainant’s allegation that the accused took pictures of her in the shower, the Crown relied on an argument that the ends justified the means.
This amplification evidence sought to allege a whole new offence and area of search.
It was not admitted;
3) The point of this voir dire was not to determine admissibility of evidence outside of the search warrant context.
There was no requirement that evidence sought in support of allegations made be directly connected to a complainant or the actual subject matter of a complainant;
4) The ITO did not use impermissible boiler plate clauses when read in its entirety.
However, it did not set forth reasonable and probable grounds that text messages were evidence with respect to the commission of an offence;
5) The ITO provided sufficient description.
It was reasonable to infer that search history meant search history of the accused with respect to the websites defined in the ITO.
Further argument was required on whether text messages could be included; and 
6) Police are not entitled to rummage through entire contents of a device searching for other evidence.
The ITO sought only the search history.","[0, 2, 3, 4, 6, 5, 10, 1]"

It found that the time between service of the statement of claim and the default judgment was not sufficiently long to prevent the defendant from defending the action.

The trial judge had found the respondent, who had taken a sleeping pill and was drunk at the time of the assault, did not have the intent to commit the assault.
Allowing the appeal,
that voluntary intoxication cannot be considered as raising a reasonable doubt as to intent in a general intent offence unless the degree of intoxication is so extreme that the accused did not even possess the minimal intent to perform the actus reus because his state was akin to automatism or insanity.
The Court noted that no medical evidence as to the affect of the sleeping pill with the alcohol was adduced, nor was there any evidence concerning the strength of the pill or the amount of alcohol consumed and concluded that the evidence supported the conclusion that the respondent appreciated the circumstances of the assault, even though he could not remember it afterward.
The Court set aside the acquittal and entered a verdict of guilty pursuant to s. 686(4)(b)(ii) of the Criminal Code as it had concluded that the respondent 'should have been found guilty but for the error in law'.","[3, 0, 2, 4, 6, 1, 5]"

[3] Joellen Huntley and her parents brought action against Andrew Larkin and his mother, who owned the vehicle, alleging negligence in the ownership and operation of the vehicle.
They also named Theodore Hogeterp as a defendant.
Mr. Hogeterp was a farmer who owned land on both sides of the road at the site of the accident.
The plaintiffs contend that he owned the dog in question and they allege negligence in failing to keep his dog off the highway.
[4] The defence of Mr. Hogeterp is that he was not the owner of the dog in question.
The defendants have cross-claimed against each other.
Evidence on the application for summary judgment:[5] Mr. Hogeterp submitted that there was no evidence supporting the claim that he owned the dog that ran onto the highway, and therefore the claim against him should be dismissed summarily.
The evidence presented by Mr. Hogeterp on the summary judgment application consisted of his affidavit and two affidavits of Michelle Kelly, one of his lawyers.
Mr. Zaun is an investigator retained by the plaintiffs.","The respondent had undertaken the residential development of certain lands bordering the appellant's property and constructed roadways which it proposed to convey to the Department of Transportation, who agreed to accept with the consent of owners of property where water would drain from the road.
When the appellant refused to consent, the respondent applied to the municipality for proceedings under the Ditches and Water Courses Act, which failed to achieve agreement.
The respondent then filed a requisition with the county clerk pursuant to s. 7(1) of the Act which allows for the appointment of a municipal engineer.
The engineer filed a report in which he concluded the respondent was entitled to open a ditch on the appellant's land, subject to certain conditions.
In this action, the appellant appealed pursuant to s. 12 of the Act.
Allowing the appeal,
that the Act appears to assume that landowners will agree that a ditch benefits their land and provides a mechanism for apportioning cost.
However, it does not give an engineer authority to expropriate land or take any interest in it, nor does it provide a means by which the appellant is forced to accept the ditch.
Further, the common law prohibits the use of another's property to solve one's drainage problems.","[2, 4, 3, 11, 1, 14, 15, 17, 13, 10, 16, 28, 12]"

(CanLII).","The defendants permitted a private building to remain on public reserve lands contrary to s. 197 of The Planning and Development Act, 1983 and the zoning bylaws of the Resort Village of Echo Bay.
They contended the bylaws were inapplicable.
They conceded the activities may be an offence under the provincial statute, but submitted the selective prosecution should be stayed as an abuse of the legal process, and a violation of their right to 'equal protection and equal benefit of the law without discrimination' under s. 15 of the Charter.
Legislation required 10% of land intended for subdivision to be given to the province.
This land was designated as 'public reserve', and its use was limited by s. 197 of The Planning and Development Act, 1983.
Most public reserves were not developed by the government, but rather by cottage owners.
Some cottage owners asserted the public was able to use the construction on public reserve, and allowing such access made such construction things that 'facilitate the use of the reserve as a public recreation area' under s. 197(f) and were legal.
In Echo Bay, the subdivision plan created a public reserve in front of cottage lots, vested in the province on October 25, 1983.
The provincial Department of Municipal Government ('Department') was to determine what fell within s. 197.
The province had no policing mechanism for violations.
The Department acted as if maintaining the reserves was the municipality's responsibility, even though the province held title.
In August 1986, Mr. and Mrs. Taillon built a boathouse on public reserve.
They did not seek permission, as their realtor said they could treat the land as part of their lot.
Their neighbour Mr. Zeah complained to Mr. Brickwell, the Senior Planner of the Department.
This resulted in an enquiry into if the defendant's activities violated s. 197 or the municipal zoning bylaw.
On October 28, 1986, Mr. Brickwell told the mayor that Department officials inspected the site and asked council to request the Taillons remove the structure.
Council advised the Department on November 24, 1986 that it was not their land or responsibility.
Mr. Brickwell informed council of proposed legislative amendments that would give title and enforcement responsibilities to municipalities.
In June 1989, council asked Mr. Fraser to produce authority to construct his boathouse and if not, they would issue a stop work order under the zoning bylaws, even though they believed they did not apply to public reserves.
Council was trying to avoid future problems once they heard of the amendments.
They received no response and issued an order.
Mr. Fraser then contacted Mr. Brickwell who told him there were numerous violations, but enforcement was lacking.
Mr. Brickwell said he did not demand the boathouse be removed because, in his view, his Department did not police public reserves.
On October 21, 1989, council passed a motion to turn the prosecution of violations of s. 197 over to the RCMP.
The province was the landowner and enforcer of the Act, so it was appropriate for the RCMP to assume prosecution.
The RCMP declined, and Mr. Brickwell informed council his Department would not act.
On January 31, 1991, an amendment to The Planning and Development Act passed which allowed municipalities to take title and passed responsibility for prosecuting offenders to local councils.
Echo Bay took title on July 6, 1992.
On February 21, 1991, council's solicitor requested the defendants and the Fosters to remove their boathouses by June 31, 1991.
The Fosters complied, but the defendants did not.
On November 16, 1991, council proceeded with the action.
Although council believed the boathouses were illegal, the Taillon boathouse was assessed for property taxes.
Council believed they must prosecute offenders to fulfill their duty to uphold the law, discourage further violations, and ensure public reserve lands were open for public use.
The defendants believed either none or all violators should be prosecuted.
Council stated it was wiser to prosecute only boathouses to obtain the court's opinion.
If council was correct, it may not be necessary to prosecute others because they might comply with the law as expressed by the court.
If the court did not agree, council should not incur any further expense.
Council asserted prosecution of boathouse owners was appropriate as boathouses caused the complaint, and they were clearly private.
The defendants view their selection for prosecution out of a numerous violators as unfair and discriminatory within the prohibition of s. 15 of the Charter.
HELD: A municipality may further restrict uses of reserve land, but it cannot allow uses not permitted by s. 197.
Taxing the boathouse was immaterial and did not imply approval.
The defendants were not misled as to their legal rights by a person in authority.
The Taillons could not have believed the opinion of the realtor; they knew they did not own the land.
Mr. Brickwell's comment that there were numerous violations being ignored could not be taken to mean the defendants were able to build on public reserve.
It was an opinion that they might escape prosecution.
The case turned on whether it was an abuse of the legal process to prosecute the defendants when other violators were ignored or a case of violating their rights under s. 15 of the Charter.
How unfair it was depended on how many violators were overlooked which turned on the reading of s. 197.
John Nanson, the Principal Planner of the Community Planning Services Branch, believed things on public reserve available to the public were not violations of s. 197.
The court did not accept this view as it allowed citizens to determine what constituted a 'public facility' and required council to launch civil actions to remove private construction.
If this was intended, no offence would be created in the first place, and the titleholder would just be left with civil remedies.
An interpretation which allowed private citizens to effectively turn public reserve into private land defeated the legislation's objective.
The fact that the titleholder was the province or a municipality and the use of the word public indicated the legislature wanted the government authority to decide what constituted a public facility.
It cannot be public unless it was authorized or actually built by the government authority and was open for public use at all times.
If the legislation was interpreted as Mr. Nanson suggested, then there were fewer violators.
This made council's decision to prosecute only boathouses less unfair, and it did not give the defendants a defence as the boathouses were not open for public use.
They constructed a private building on public reserve contrary to s. 197, therefore the boathouses were illegal under s. 221(1)(a)(ii) of the Act.
The defendants were guilty unless prosecution was stayed as an abuse of process or because it violated s. 15 of the Charter.
Council prosecuted defendants whom they saw as committing clear violations.
To prosecute all violators initially would add expense at no benefit.
A decision on boathouses was likely to lead to the desired clarification of the law.
They had a complaint upon which they had a duty to act and wanted a test case to determine the legal position.
Selective prosecution, per se, is not an abuse of process; rather it depends on the circumstances.
The defendants must show they were singled out unfairly, not just that they were singled out.
There was no such evidence.
Stopping prosecutions for abuse of process is a power only to be used in the 'clearest of cases' (R. v. Keyowski).
The defence must show that proceeding exceeds 'the limits of the community sense of fair play' and the administration of justice is best served by stopping the prosecution.
In R. v. Rourke, the SCC said there was no general discretion to stay proceedings because they were considered 'oppressive'.
In R. v. Jewitt, the SCC adopted the test from R. v. Young that 'there is a residual discretion in a trial judge to stay proceedings where compelling an accused to stand trial would violate those fundamental principles of justice which underlie the community's sense of fair play and decency, and to prevent the abuse of court's process through oppressive or vexatious proceedings'.
Picking out defendants to prosecute from a pool of offenders to ascertain the legal position of the parties because one of their group has been the subject of a complaint did not violate 'the community sense of fair play and decency'.
The defence relied on Regina v. Miles of Music Ltd. where the court said that 'no cause can fall within the category of the Ã¦clearest of cases' unless it can be fairly said that the cause of the apparent unfairness complained of can be Ã attributed to either the police or the Crown or both'.
The defence said council not only did not prosecute, but did not investigate whether others were in violation.
The court acknowledged this was so, but accepted the motivation was that council believed Mr. Nanson, and they did not currently intend to prosecute all violators.
The defendant's real complaint was the decision to only prosecute boathouse owners.
Council was trying to ascertain the law, so they could fulfill their duty to uphold it.
The court found council proceeded against the defendants because it seemed sensible and financially responsible to do so, not because of any male fides.
The municipal bylaws were not applicable to public reserves, but it made sense to seek the court's opinion on their applicability since council was going ahead with the action.
The fact that one count was laid under the bylaws did not violate the community sense of fair play, but if it did, this would mean that count should be stayed.
Council rightly attempted to get others to prosecute which caused a reasonable delay and did not prejudice the defendants.
Any unsatisfactory delay was caused by the Department and not council.
The Charter gives a right to a trial within a reasonable time, but this applies after a charge is laid.
The delay by the province occurred pre-charge.
There was no unreasonable post-charge delay or abuse of the legal process.
Section 15 of the Charter is not limited to the enumerated types of discrimination, but it does not prohibit all discrimination.
It must be commonly accepted discrimination abhorrent to the basic principles of society with no reason that justifies a breach of such principles.
It was not discrimination contrary to s. 15 to select individuals to prosecute as a test case where it was not done for improper reasons.
 'Equal protection and equal benefit of the law' did not mean one was entitled to have prosecution stopped until all violators were prosecuted.
Picking out boathouse builders was not an example of discrimination prohibited by s. 15.
The defence argued the law was not allowed to have unequal impact because of irrelevant circumstances (Law Society of British Columbia v. Andrews).
This case should not be read so broadly.
In the court's view, the proceedings should not be stayed because there was no violation of s. 15, and if the court was wrong, it was not 'appropriate and just' that such a remedy be granted, as required for relief under s. 24 of the Charter.","[13, 10, 21, 22, 14, 25, 9, 27, 11, 19, 29, 31, 30, 3, 0, 8, 5, 24, 35, 38, 39, 34, 42, 20]"

Counsel: Michael Coyle and Thomas MacEwan, for the appellants Thomas Jarmyn, for the respondentReasons for judgment: [1] This is an appeal from an interlocutory order dismissing the appellants’ demand for particulars of a general damage claim.
[2] In an action initiated in the Supreme Court, Twin Mountain Construction (the respondent) has claimed that Norma Milne and Murray Tweedie (the appellants) “negligently or fraudulently” misrepresented the boundaries of a parcel of property that the appellants sold to the respondent.
Alternatively, the respondent claimed breach of contract.
Since 1996 the respondent company had, with permission of the appellants, used the property for composting, the creation of topsoil and sand excavation.
The respondent says, in essence, that because the property is materially less than the size it was represented to be, its plans to extract sand or otherwise develop the property are negatively affected.
[3] The appellants (defendants in the Supreme Court action) demanded better particulars of the damages (Civil Procedure Rule 14.24).","The 21 year old appealed his conviction of armed robbery, the sentence of three years imprisonment and a ten year s.100 order.
HELD: The conviction appeal was dismissed, the sentence appeal was allowed and one year incarceration with a ten year s100 order were imposed.
The Crown was correct in characterizing the incident as technically a robbery which was at the low end of the scale of seriousness.
What originally would have been a shop-lifting became more serious because of the altercation between the clerk and the appellant.","[2, 1, 3, 6, 0, 4, 10, 7, 5, 9]"

One of the defendants, Dow Chemical, sought a declaration that the Court of Queen's Bench did not have jurisdiction to hear the action and to have the service ex juris set aside.
Dow Chemical argued that there was no causal connection between it and the plaintiff's damages.
HELD: The application was dismissed.
The plaintiff was awarded her taxable costs in any event of the cause.
It must be assumed that the allegations have a factual basis and liability may rest with the defendant, Dow Chemical, in both tort and contract, therefore it was considered appropriate to assume jurisdiction.
 1)The Court did not have jurisdiction over the defendant on the basis of common law.
The defendant is not resident in Saskatchewan and has no direct or real connection to the province.
2)The plaintiff is assumed to have suffered damages in both contract and tort.
Applying Queen's Bench Rule 31(l)(f)(g) and the Moran case, the Court should assume jurisdiction absent any reason to the contrary.
3)Three of the four main topics in the statement of claim have reference to Dow Chemical: the failure to inform certain regulatory bodies and the public at large about the risk of breast implants; marketing and distributing the implants which were of non-merchantable quality and breach of warranties.
4)The final plea was that Dow Corning and Dow Chemical were in reality one and the same entity.
It was thus suggested that the corporate veil should be pulled aside and any wrongful acts of Dow Corning should be treated as those of Dow Chemical.
This differs significantly from vicarious liability where no fault is attributable to the third party but liability attaches because of the relationship.
If fault were found to be directly attributable to Dow Chemical there would be a causal connection.
5)The allegation that Dow Chemical breached its duty to disclose the inherent risk suggested a link between the alleged failure to disclose and the injuries.

:This is an appeal from a decision of a judge of the Family Court declining to rescind an order in 1993 for permanent care and custody of the appellant's granddaughter.
Unfortunately, the adoption plans did not materialize because the agency lost confidence in the appellant's parenting skills.
The appellant has a drug dependency problem and by June of 1995 was hospitalized.
At that time, the appellant's husband reported the problem to the agency it sought its intervention because he alone could not care for the child.
These rules were available for application by the Family Court at the discretion of the judge by virtue of Rule 1.04 of the Family Court Rules.","The surviving spouse of the insured deceased, who died in a motor vehicle accident, took issue with the calculation of the death benefit paid for herself and her two children which had been reviewed and approved by SGI.
At issue was whether the weekly income replacement benefit referred to in Division 5 of the Act had a separate and distinct meaning from the income replacement benefit in Division 4.
HELD: SGI's decision was set aside and SGI was directed to recalculate and pay the death benefit to the surviving spouse and dependent children in accordance with the directions of the court.
 1)The Interpretation Act requires legislation be given a fair, large and liberal construction to best assure the attainment of its objectives and that definitions given apply to the entire statute and regulations unless a contrary intention appears in the statute or regulations. 2)The phrase income replacement benefit (IRB) used in s136(1) is not analogous to the IRB in s146(1).
There is no requirement to use the formula in s136(1) to calculate the surviving spouse's death benefit.
S146(1) is a self-contained formula.
3)Because the Act is silent on a maximum yearly employment income the actual income earned is the sum that is used to determine the IRB in s146(1).
The ordinary meaning of a death benefit being one-half the weekly IRB is that the payment is made on a weekly basis.
4)The IRB as calculated in s146(5) is the same as the IRB in s 146(1).
5)Leave was granted for the parties to bring the matter back, if required, with respect to the interest on benefits not paid.","[0, 2, 1, 3, 4, 5, 7, 8, 9, 12, 11, 6, 13, 16]"

135399IN THE SUPREME COURT OF NOVA SCOTIA[Cite as: Canada Life Mortgage Services Ltd. v. Leeside Estates Ltd. et al.
(Orally):[1] The origin of this action was a mortgage foreclosure commenced by Canada Life Mortgage Services (""Canada Life"") against Leeside Estates Ltd. and Byung K. Lee.
According to the pleadings the defendants (and I will refer to them collectively throughout this decision as ""Lee"", whether in their capacity as defendants or as plaintiffs by counterclaim) planned to construct an apartment complex at Kentville, Nova Scotia.
Lee also retained the services of Kentville lawyer R. Peter Muttart, Q.C.
[2] The mortgage to Canada Life fell into arrears during construction of the apartment complex and Canada Life commenced this foreclosure action.
Lee denied (in his personal capacity) that he is a mortgagor and denied liability as a guarantor and in addition, has accused Canada Life of acting in such a manner as to cause the failure of the project.
[3] Lee's counterclaim against Canada Life and CMHC is for breach of contract, breach of fiduciary duty to Lee, or for negligence.
Lee's claim against the other defendants by counterclaim includes negligent misrepresentation, breach of fiduciary duty, breach of contract, negligence.
[4] Mr. Muttart acted for Lee in various legal aspects of the development.

HELD: The appeal was allowed and the acquittals ordered by the trial judge were restored.
There was no basis to overturn the findings of fact made by the trial judge.
The appeal judge misinterpreted the decision of the trial judge who properly considered the issue of income before dealing with mens rea.

[6] THE RECUSAL MOTION: As indicated, Ms. Stephen made a motion at the outset of the taxation hearing requesting that I recuse myself.
[7] The basis of the motion was that there was a reasonable apprehension of bias on my part.","The issue on appeal was reduced to whether the security holder, Lanson, authorized Nickel to sell the mobile home as contemplated by s28(1) or, if not authorized, did he sell the mobile home in the ordinary course of business as contemplated by s30(2).
Lanson loaned Nickel $16,000 to purchase a mobile home and registered their financing statement giving them a security interest in the mobile home.
The trial judge found that Lanson knew that Nickel would either rent or sell the home but that upon a sale Nickel would repay the loan in full.
Nickel sold the home but did not disclose the sale to Lanson.
The purchaser, SP Trucking, did not require financing and did not search the Personal Property Registry. SP Trucking sold the home to Rempel who obtained financing from the Credit Union which registered a financing agreement claiming a security interest in the home and its proceeds.
Lanson attempted to seize the home.
The trial judge found Lanson's security interest continued and took priority over that of the Credit Union as Lanson had not authorized the sale to the trucking company and that Lanson had no interest in releasing the security interest until he received payment in full.
 HELD: 1)Section 28(1) reiterates the common law principle of nemo dat quod non habet.
The debtor's right to deal with collateral is subject to the security interest granted to the creditor unless certain things occur- ie. the secured party authorized expressly or by implication the dealing with the security.
2)The trial judge was in error in finding the secured party, Lanson, had to authorize the buyer, SP Trucking, to deal with the property and that the buyer must know of the authorization.
Section 28(1) does not contemplate an authorization to a third party to deal with the collateral.
The fundamental issue was whether the authorization was subject to the pre-condition of payment in full.
3)The authorization to sell must be given before the sale.
Lanson clearly gave Nickel express authority to deal with the security which would include resale.
The fact the debtor failed to pay the secured creditor did not invalidate the sale to the buyer.
 4)Canadian Commercial Bank is restricted to cases where the secured party agrees with the buyer to release the security interest on the express condition that the obligation is satisfied in full and makes it clear to the debtor he does not intend to rely simply on the proceeds.
There is a distinction between a conditional authorization and an authorized sale subject to conditions that the proceeds be remitted to the secured party.
5)The trial judge clearly found that Lanson authorized the dealing.
It followed that the security interest did not continue in the collateral and the title passed to the buyer.
The Credit Union acquired the collateral free of the security interest of Lanson and Lanson's rights against Nickle were restricted to the proceeds.
 6)By declining to deal with the matter of s30(2), the appellate court was not to be taken as approving of the reasons of the trial judge. 7)The appellant was awarded costs on double Column V.","[5, 7, 9, 2, 6, 8, 10, 12, 13, 3, 11]"

[1] On December 30, 1994 a violent head on collision occurred on the Trans Canada Highway near Woodstock, New Brunswick between two tractor trailers driven by the plaintiff Robert Fowler and the defendant Michael Magoon respectively.
Mr. Fowler was seriously injured in the accident and brought this action for the recovery of damages from Mr. Magoon and his then employer, Schneider National Carriers Inc.[2] By earlier disposition, the issues of liability and damages were severed.
The issue of liability only was tried before a civil jury on April 3-7, 2000 as a result of which it was found that the accident was caused by the negligence of the defendants.
The jury further found that there was contributory negligence on the part of the plaintiff Robert Fowler on account of his failure to wear a seatbelt.
In its verdict, the jury apportioned liability between the parties in the division of 57½% / 42½% in favour of Mr. Fowler.
[3] Following the trial, an Order for judgment was taken out directing the defendants to pay to the plaintiffs Robert Fowler and Kim Fowler 57½% of their damages to be assessed.
With a judicial assessment of damages several months away, the plaintiffs have now brought application under Civil Procedure Rule 33.01(A) seeking an interim payment from the defendants.","The accused who had plead guilty to a charge of dangerous driving causing death sought a conditional sentence to be served in the community.
Various witnesses gave conflicting accounts of the driving leading up to the accident and the accident itself.
Two vehicles driving at a high rate of speed, one in the left lane and one in the right hand curb lane passed vehicles stopped at a cross walk, the later striking and killing a pedestrian.
The vehicles had been observed pulling around other vehicles whenever possible and 'jousting' with each other.
HELD: A sentence of 90 days to be served intermittently in a provincial correctional centre was imposed.
Conditions of probation included restraint from the consumption of alcohol and non-prescription drugs for 24 hours prior to attendance at the centre.
An 18 month probation order required him to perform 200 hours of community service and to enroll in a defensive driving course.
He was prohibited from operating a motor vehicle for three years and was to pay a surcharge of $250.
 1)The Saskatchewan Court of Appeal had not to date considered the question of whether it was appropriate that a sentence of imprisonment be served in the community where the offence is that of dangerous driving causing death.
It has consistently endorsed sentences of incarceration for the offence of impaired driving causing death.
Alternatives to incarceration were rejected as not adequately reflecting the gravity of the offence and as not serving to deter either the offender or the general public from committing like offences.
2)The driver's lack of attention together with excessive speed caused the accident.
Alcohol was not involved.
He stopped to render assistance whereas the driver of the second car which had been racing with him left the scene of the accident immediately.
Principles of general and specific deterrence, rehabilitation, denunciation, protection of the public and maintenance of public confidence in the administration of justice were to be considered.
3)Specific deterence had to be emphasized in view of the driver's subsequent convictions for two speeding offences.
The accused had six speeding convictions.
He had a minor youth record involving mischief.","[1, 0, 5, 6, 8, 4, 9, 7, 3]"

The dispute between the parties has arisen under the Natural Products Marketing Act, chapter 308, R.S.N.S.

This Statute which authorizes the regulating of production and marketing of particular natural products in Nova Scotia is administered by the Natural Products Marketing Council, one of the Respondents, represented on this interlocutory matter by The Attorney General.
The Board requested the Council to hold a “show cause” hearing.
After making that request there was a procedural breakdown between the Board and the Council with respect to how that hearing would proceed, with the Board seeking and being denied, an adjournment.

BATEMAN, J.A.
: [1] This is an appeal from the decision of Justice John M. Davison of the Supreme Court, in chambers [reported at [2000] N.S.J.
No.37 (Q.L.
)], dismissing the appellant’s application, inter alia, to set aside a recovery order issued by the Prothonotary.
BACKGROUND: [2] The appellant, Paranet Services Inc. carrying on business as Atlantic Business Systems (“ABS”) agreed to provide materials and labour to construct a home for the respondent, Robert Brett Barefoot, in Sapporo, Japan.
Whether the shipment of a fourth container was contemplated is in dispute.
The first two containers were shipped in September and October, 1999.
This amount was wired by Mr. Barefoot to ABS on October 26, 1999.
That order was issued ex parte by the Prothonotary pursuant to Civil Procedure Rule 48.01.
[4] ABS applied, pursuant to Civil Procedure Rules 48.06 and 48.08, for interlocutory relief from the recovery order and for security for costs.
That application was heard by Justice Davison.
It is from that dismissal that ABS appeals.","The petitioner obtained an ex parte order under the Family Maintenance Act which restrains the Attorney General from paying any money owing under an action in Queen's Bench to the respondent and his solicitor and restraining the respondent from disposing of any monies received in the action.
The respondent applies to have the order set aside.
The respondent argues that a restraining order under the Act is a preservation of property order and should not be granted because the petitioner has not met the tests that govern the granting of such orders.
He submits that the criteria for the granting of a preservation order is the same as for a interlocutory injunction.
The respondent argues that before the Court can exercises its discretion and grant an order, is should have some evidence that the party being restrained would defeat a claim under the Act.
HELD: The Court is satisfied that the respondent's personal claim for damages is the only asset the he has to satisfy the claim under the Act.
Without prejudicing the applicant's claim, the Court will arbitrarily determine that the sum of $40,000 will likely be sufficient security.
For the time being, the order will attach to the first $40,000 of funds received by the respondent, if and when any amount becomes payable to him.
The parties may apply to vary this amount in future.
Costs are reserved to be dealt with on the hearing of the application for maintenance.
The Court is not satisfied that the jurisprudence with respect to injunctive remedies based on inherent jurisdiction of the court applies to an application under s.8 of the Act.
If the criteria for granting a restraining order under the Act were meant to be the same, there would be no need for the unique provision of the Act.
As s.8 was enacted to provide a solution where none had existed, the Court must primarily look to the statute itself for a determination of the appropriate considerations.
Section 8 of the Act grants the Court the authority to restrain the disposition of assets and creates a new, but limited, form of injunctive relief with this remedy being available solely to prevent the impairment or defeat of the Act.
The statute does not require the Court to be satisfied that the respondent is hindering or defeating a claim.
When a respondent has only one asset that could reasonably satisfy a claim, his dependents and society as a whole have an interest in ensuring that the asset will be used for such purpose.","[1, 3, 4, 5, 8, 6, 7, 9, 0, 15, 12, 23, 26, 25, 13, 10, 28]"
523,"The court issued a 71 page decision on May 16, 2008.
The last paragraph of the decision stated:I will accept written submissions on costs if the parties request such relief.
However I will state that this is one of those cases where there is no clear winner.
Also, I find that both parties contributed to the circumstances that led to this trial.
[2] Notwithstanding these words Force Construction Limited indicated that they wished to make submissions on the recovery of costs, disbursements and pre-judgment interest.
[3] On September 8, 2008 I received submissions from Ms. Campbell.
She advances the position articulated by the court, that is, “that the parties should bear their own individual costs.” Alternatively she proposes a set off approach.
[4] On September 29, 2008 I received submissions from Force Construction Limited.
They point out that they made a Rule 41A formal offer to settle on May 25, 2007 in the amount of $67,800 ($60,000 plus HST).
This offer was not accepted by Ms. Campbell and she recovered $64,147.85 after trial.
[5] The question is whether my after trial perception should be disturbed as a result of the above submissions.

Heard: November 26, 2009, in Halifax, Nova ScotiaCounsel: Beth Newton, for the Applicant/Defendant Allen Fownes, for the Respondent/Plaintiff By the Court:[1] C & R Sterling Farm, one of the defendants in the main proceeding, moves for an order terminating an attachment order against it, pursuant to Rule 44.10.
Sterling farm also seeks a change of the place of the proceeding, from Halifax to Windsor NS.
Background[2] The main proceeding involves a dispute between the plaintiff, Sierra Forestry, and the defendants, with respect to a contract by which Sierra agreed to harvest timber and wood fibre from about 275 acres of land owned by the defendant Sterling Farm.
[3] According to the statement of claim, after harvesting began, the plaintiffs entered “a formal Timber Cutting Agreement and Lease” relating to the same property.
This agreement was dated October 18, 2006.
The plaintiff claims that the October 2006 agreement referred to the wrong parcel of land, and seeks rectification, on the basis of mutual mistake, in the main proceeding.","The appellants motion to strike the respondent's statement of claim was dismissed on the ground that questions of law are not matters to be brought before the court on an application to strike.
The Chambers judge also accepted the respondent's submission that the extent of the immunity of administrative boards and their members from actions such as this based on their alleged malice and bad faith is, as yet, unclear in Canada.
Allowing the appeal in part,
that the Chambers judge erred when he concluded that all questions of law, including questions where the law is clear, should not be brought before the court in an application to strike, when he concluded that the constitutional question posed by the respondent had not yet been answered by the courts, and when he determined that the extent of the immunity of the appellant Board and its members, except for the Chair, was unclear.

In issue was whether the assessor erred in law by misconstruing or misapplying the provisions of the Assessment Manual in determining the MAF for the appellant's shopping centre properties by using a single sale to calculate the MAF; and by creating as a commercial building neighbourhood the grouping of fully enclosed shopping centres which encompassed the entire city.
HELD: 1)The assessment was set aside and the matter was remitted to the assessor to be dealt with according to the manual.
Both issues were dealt with in Cadillac Fairview v. Saskatoon (TWL CA00074) and the same reasoning applied. 2)The appellant conceded that the question of whether the various expansions of the shopping centre resulted in abnormal functional economic obsolescence was a question of mixed law and fact and was thus beyond the scope of this appeal.
3)The second branch of the appeal was dismissed.
Whether the committee erred in law by saying the definition of functional obsolescence did not apply to an add-on type of construction was beside the point since that was not the ground for the decision.
The decision was not the result of any wrong interpretation of the manual but was the result of the appellant's failure to establish to the committee's satisfaction the facts on which it based its case.
The decision was therefore beyond the Court of Appeal's jurisdiction to review.
 4)There was no order as to costs as success was divided.","[2, 4, 3, 7, 9, 5, 17, 14, 8, 13, 20, 26]"

Counsel: John Rafferty, Q.C., agent solicitor for the appellant Sarah L. Harris, for the appellant E. Roxanne MacLaurin, for the respondentReasons for judgment:I.
INTRODUCTION:[1] Mr. Garth sued the Halifax Regional Municipality for negligence.
Years later, he decided he should amend his action to add a new claim against a new defendant.
By then, the new claim was barred by a limitation period.
held that he did not have authority under the Civil Procedure Rules to grant it and dismissed Mr. Garth’s application.
[2] Mr. Garth appeals.
[3] In my view, the Rules gave the judge a discretion to grant the amendment.
I, therefore, conclude that he erred in thinking that he had no authority to do so.
That leaves the question of whether the amendment should be granted.
The proposed defendant was not given notice of the application to add it as a party.
I do not think we should deal with the amendment application on its merits without giving the proposed new defendant an opportunity to be heard.","The accused was charged with operating a motor vehicle while his ability to do so was impaired and while over .08 (breath sample readings were 160 and 150 mg) contrary to s. 253(a) and s.253(b) of the Criminal Code, respectively.
Issues arising during the trial included whether there was a breach of his s.8 and s.9 Charter rights to be secure against unreasonable search or seizure, and not to be arbitrarily detained; if there was a breach, was there a remedy under s.24(2); whether the evidence was sufficient to prove the offence of impaired driving beyond a reasonable doubt.
The police officer concluded that he had reasonable and probable grounds for the breath demand based upon the accused sleeping through two green traffic lights, a strong smell of alcohol, and his somewhat bloodshot or glassy eyes.
HELD: The accused was acquitted of both charges.
1)The evidence was sufficient to establish breaches of s.8 and s.9 of the Charter.
The Certificate of Analysis constituted conscriptive evidence which, on balance, would not have been discovered by alternative means.
Its admission into evidence might render the trial unfair and bring the administration of justice into disrepute.
In the absence of the Certificate of Analysis, the evidence was not sufficient to prove the offence under s.253(b) beyond a reasonable doubt.
2)The strong smell of alcohol and somewhat bloodshot or glassy eyes were not sufficient to conclude there were reasonable and probable grounds for the demand.
The court is required to examine the evidence as a whole.
Every case will depend a great deal on its individual circumstances.
It was not reasonable for the officer to assume that the vehicle not moving at the lights was a reliable indicator of impairment for these purposes.
The evidence of slurred speech was not reliable as there was nothing in the officer's notes regarding slurred speech, nor had it been included in the investigation documents.
The accused did not have any problems with balance or manner of walk, was cooperative throughout, and did not have any difficulty understanding his rights and the breath demand read to him from a printed card.
The officer did not ask the accused whether he had been drinking.
3)The nature and quality of the evidence of a strong smell of alcohol, and eyes which were somewhat glassy or bloodshot, in the context of Stellato, was so frail as to leave a reasonable doubt as to impairment.
The 'classic' signs of impairment (erratic driving, strong odour of alcoholic beverage, glassy and bloodshot eyes, slurred speech and unsteadiness on one's feet) was not intended to be an all-encompassing list, and its application will very much depend on the circumstances of a given case.","[2, 7, 13, 3, 15, 6, 4, 5, 1, 11, 17, 18, 14, 10]"

After discussion with HRM, this application was withdrawn.
This was followed by a further application for a development permit November the 30th, 1999 which was simply to add living space to the existing single unit dwelling.
This was granted December the 24th, 1999 on the condition that all R2 general residential zone requirements were met and the plan was revised to show an addition to a single family dwelling and such plans indicated for example, one kitchen.

HELD: The application was adjourned to June 7.
1)The homestead provisions of s.44 had no application in this case.
The land was not being put to any farming use prior to August 1992 and the respondent's house at the time fell into the category of 'simply a dwelling in isolation' (Bank of Nova Scotia v. Blair).

[2] This is an application advanced by seven applicants for an order pursuant to Civil Procedure Rule 56 in the nature of certiorari to quash the decision of the Board to close the two schools.
All seven applicants are parents of children attending Northbrook, and none of the applicants have children attending Notting Park.
The senior staff of the Board comprise the Executive Council, which is the strategic and policy formulation body for the Board.
There are procedures whereby members of the Executive Council prepare reports which are vetted by the Executive Council prior to being forwarded, on behalf of the Superintendent, to the elected members of the Board for consideration.
[5] Each area is divided into “families of schools” which are grouped on the basis of the sixteen high schools for which the Board is responsible.

Counsel: Agnes MacNeil, for the Appellant Respondent in person Edward Gores, Q.C., for the Attorney General of Nova ScotiaReasons for judgment: I.
INTRODUCTION:[1] At the root of this appeal is the question of how much “elbow room” the courts should give the Securities Commission to carry out its regulatory duties.
In my view, the short answer in this case is quite a lot.
Mr. Potter applied to the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia for certiorari to quash that investigation.
A number of procedural issues arose.
His order gave rise to this appeal by the Commission.
[4] The chambers judge essentially granted Mr. Potter’s application and dismissed the Commission’s.
[5] The Commission seeks leave to appeal.
Its main submission is that the underlying judicial review application is improper and premature and that, as a result, the procedural orders under appeal should not have been made.
In short, the Commission says that Mr. Potter ought, in the first instance, to take his complaints about the investigation to it, not to the courts.
[6] For the reasons which follow, I agree with the Commission’s position.
ISSUES:[7] Although many issues are raised on appeal, it is only necessary, in my view, to deal with two of them:1.
Should we consider the appropriateness of the underlying judicial review application on this interlocutory appeal?","The defendant had a 25 year lease in a shopping centre which provided that the defendant would only use the premises for the purposes of the business of the retail sale of a complete line of food products, as well as general merchandising, as carried out by the rest of the majority of its stores.
The defendant proposed to open a pharmacy on the premises.
Another tenant in the shopping centre already operated a drug store and their lease provided that no other tenant would operate a drug store in any part of their premises.
The other tenant brought an application for a interim injunction against the defendant.
The receiver of the shopping centre also brought an application for a declaration that the defendant could not operate a pharmacy on its premises.
The defendant objected to the receiver's application on the basis that it involved controverted issues of fact requiring a trial.
Application for interim injunction dismissed on the basis that the applicant had not established irreparable harm; the receiver's application could proceed as an application as the potential for a factual dispute was insubstantial; defendant provided with the option of either accepting an adjournment to allow time for further investigation, the conduct of discoveries and the presenting of any further evidence or moving for the court's further consideration.","[2, 4, 11, 6, 17, 3, 9, 15, 20, 5, 23, 8, 24, 19, 18]"

[2] The written release of decision February 17, 2005 left counsel to attempt to reach agreement with respect to costs and disbursements failing which the court would receive representations from both parties which have now been received.
[3] The originating notice action in this matter was filed July 21, 2003 and therefore the new tariff of September 29, 2004 does not apply, (Little v. Chignecto Central Regional School Board (2004), 2004 NSSC 265 (CanLII), 230 N.S.R.

Each of the three Informations sworn by an RCMP officer alleged the accused and his 19 year old daughter committed incest contrary to s.155, and a 7 month old child was born as a result.
The Informations deposed that the Crown had obtained a DNA sample of the person who claimed to be the natural mother of the 19 year old.HELD: 1)No case was found dealing was a similar application regarding a possible charge under s.155.
The words of s.487.05 were analyzed to determine its proper meaning and interpretation.
'Bodily substances' is not defined in the general definition s.2 nor the DNA definition s.487.04 of the Criminal Code. Assuming, without deciding, that it is proper to conclude that the child is a victim, there has been no bodily substance found or obtained from the child or from anyone else, and accordingly no portion of s.487.05(1)(b) is applicable.
Subparagraphs 487.05(1)(b)(ii), (iii) and (iv) all refer to a bodily substance found or obtained on or within the body of a victim or some other person involved with the offence; 487.05(1)(b)(i) and (iv) refer to bodily substances found or obtained at or related to the place where the offence was committed.
Nothing in s.487.05 suggests that a blood sample of a child born of an alleged incestuous relationship, which is not in the possession of the Crown and remains in the child, is a bodily substance found or obtained within the meaning of s.487.05(1)(a).
2)There were numerous deficiencies in the Informations.
The paragraphs did not set out the basis or source of the officer's information, the relationship of the parties to the named informant, nor why the information was considered reliable.
There should be some indication as to how the DNA analysis will establish that the adult male is the natural father and how it will negative any suggestion that the parents of the baby are 'strangers' genetically speaking.
The qualifications of the RCMP officer who will take the blood samples and of the corporal who trained him should be set out.
The paragraphing format was confusing.
3)A DNA warrant application would be premature.
The custodial parent or parents are in the legal position of being the persons who can give informed consent to the taking of the baby's blood.
It may be appropriate at some point to order a sample be obtained.
It was questionable whether it was in the best interests of the administration of justice to make such an order now.","[0, 1, 2, 3, 5, 4, 7, 6, 8]"

[3] NSPI sought summary judgment for AMCI’s alleged failure to supply the requisite tonnage in quarters 2, 3 and 4 of 2004.
In a decision released on May 14, 2007 the court granted summary judgment to NSPI for the 56,634.99 tonnes which AMCI failed to supply in quarter 2.
It refused to grant summary judgment for either quarter 3 or quarter 4.
The decision left it to counsel for the parties to try to reach an agreement on costs.
Unfortunately they could not do so thus leaving it to the court to decide.
[4] In addition to costs of this application, the court has also been asked to rule on costs of another application brought by AMCI to compel production.
The parties ultimately reached a compromise thereby avoiding the need for the hearing of this second application, but only after discovery of the affiant who had provided an affidavit in support of the application.
[5] The affiant was an expert retained by AMCI to provide an opinion with respect to the commercial reasonableness of the purchase of substitute coal by NSPI.","An appeal of conviction for operating a motor vehicle while impaired by alcohol (Criminal Code s.255 and s.253) on the grounds of misdirection in finding there was sufficient evidence beyond a reasonable doubt as to impairment; an incorrect inference and failure to give correct legal effect to the facts as found including the lack of evidence of impairment at the material time while he was in care or control of the vehicle.
HELD: The appeal was dismissed.
1)There was no palpable or overriding error in the assessment of the evidence or in the interpretation or application of the law to the evidence.
Findings of fact concerning the essential elements of care and control and impairment were supported by the evidence.
The law outlined Shuparski and authorities cited within were properly applied when determining the appellant had care and control.
 2)Stellato was correctly applied along with the tests and observations outlined in Landes and Hall in concluding his ability to operate the vehicle was impaired by alcohol. 3)While Burdett reflects the current state of the law governing circumstantial evidence, it remains subject to the rule in Hodge's case (1838).
However this rule does not apply here because there was some direct evidence concerning his ability to operate the vehicle during the first time frame (R.v.Comba).

Mr. Leahey proposes that the court fix costs in the amount of $15,000.00 plus disbursements.

[2] In anticipation of collection proceedings, Ms. Mabey brought a Divorce Act application against Mr. Mabey.
While she cited various forms of relief, the tenor of the application was retroactive.
Pre-trial conference discussions led to Ms. Mabey filing an originating notice seeking the same relief in contract.
She seeks consolidation so that there would be one hearing.
That is the application before this court.
[3] Ms. Mabey’s Divorce Act application seeks relief in several forms.
She also seeks declaratory relief, exemplary or punitive damages and costs.
[4] The spousal support waiver in this couples corollary relief judgment and the lack of any material change in circumstances takes spousal support out of the picture.

[2] Steven and Jody Johansson were injured in a single vehicle accident while passengers in a vehicle driven by the other plaintiff, Maria Johansson.
The accident occurred on October 25, 1998.
[3] Both Steven and Jody Johansson were paid damages for the injuries they sustained.
The amount paid to each of the plaintiffs was acknowledged in writing and they each signed a release acknowledging full and final settlement of any claims arising from the accident.
[6] GMCL’s motion for summary judgment is against Steven and Jody Johansson only.","After the court released its decision but before an order was issued, the court received a letter from the respondent in which it was stated that he had not been served with the applicant's application and supporting material.
The applicant had previously provided the court with a sworn Affidavit of Service indicating otherwise.
The respondent was provided with the judge's assistant's name and phone number and given a date by which he was to contact the assistant.
The assistant was not contacted but the respondent sent a second letter to the court enclosing a document entitled 'Affidavit' which again stated that he had not been informed of when the hearing was to take place.
A telephone conference was arranged but the court was unable to contact the respondent at the set time despite numerous calls and messages from the court.
The applicant now sought additional costs due to the time counsel had taken to prepare for the telephone conference.

BACKGROUND:[2] In 1996 the Plaintiff was charged with seven drug and weapons related offences.
In 1997 he was charged with possession of proceeds of crime and possession of a narcotic for the purpose of trafficking.
Prior to being charged in 1996, the AGC obtained a search warrant and a restraint order from this court pursuant to section 462.32 and 462.33 of the Criminal Code of Canada.
These orders prohibited the Plaintiff from disposing of or otherwise dealing in any manner with any interest in his residential property at 47 Granite Cove Drive, Five Island Lake, Nova Scotia.
[3] A number of these charges were stayed on November 17, 2001.
[4] On May 21, 2009, the Plaintiff filed a statement of claim against the AGC alleging that he suffered damages as a result of the “improper withholding of his real and personal property” by the Defendant.
In response the AGC brought a motion for summary judgment on the pleadings.
[5] Justice LeBlanc dismissed the statement of claim in its entirety but without prejudice to the Plaintiff’s right to file an amended statement of claim.","Wal-Mart Canada applies for an order pursuant to Rule 664 and Rule 673 of The Queen's Bench Rules of Court quashing the orders of the Board.
The orders require Wal-Mart Canada to discover and produce documents.
Wal-Mart Canada says that the Board does not have the jurisdiction to use the subpoena or make the disclosure and productions orders in the manner in which it has done.
Wal-Mart Canada also applies for an order declaring s. 9 of The Trade Union Act unconstitutional.
HELD: The orders of the Board are quashed with costs payable forthwith to Wal-Mart Canada by UFCW.
The application for an order declaring s. 9 of The Trade Union Act to be unconstitutional and of no force and effect is dismissed without prejudice to Wal-Mart Canada to bring its application back.
1) The Court concluded that a review of the transcript was essential to the proper determination of the issues raised by the application and that it must be considered part of the record.
 2) The case law has determined that orders made by the Board that in reality are document discovery orders, are orders made without jurisdiction to which the applicable standard of review is one of correctness.
3) The Board abused its jurisdiction and power to issue the subpoena duces tecum in two respects.
First the Board issued the subpoena without any prior consideration as the relevance of the documents that it compelled Wal-Mart Canada to produce.
The subpoena was issued before the hearings commenced.
There is no evidence that the Board exercised its discretion judicially in considering the issue of relevancy.
It is unlikely that the Board even scrutinized the subpoena or it would have likely required the scope of it to be narrowed.
Second, the subpoena was far too generalized and amounts to an order to discover documents.
The Board must restrict its consideration to evidence that is relevant to the issues before it.
It is precluded from making its decision on the basis of irrelevant or improper considerations.
4) The Board exceeded its jurisdiction and abused its power in making the discovery and production orders it did.
The comments of the Court with respect to the subpoena duces tecum apply in principle to the Board's discovery and production orders.
The orders were not production orders but directed Wal-Mart to comply with the subpoena duces tecum.
 5) The requirement that evidence, including documentary evidence, be relevant before it can be properly considered, is a substantive issue that goes to the heart of the legitimacy of judicial or quasi-judicial dispute determination.
It is an important consideration in determining whether there has been a denial of natural justice where there has been reliance on improper considerations rather than relevant evidence. 6)
Some of the documents sought are in the possession and control of a third party non-resident American corporation.
Additional factors and procedures should at least have been considered such as the 'likely relevance' of the documents to an issue.
Solicitor and client privilege was raised with respect to some of the documents yet the Board ordered the production of those documents without ruling on the issue or without providing a means by which the confidentiality of the documents could be maintained until a ruling was made.
7) The Board has demonstrated a reluctance to give up its perceived powers of discovery despite two previous decisions of the Court of Queen's Bench and the Court of Appeal.
If it interprets this decision of the Court in the same fashion, an order to reconsider the issues would be of little value to the applicant.
The only feasible option is to grant the relief that is sought by quashing the two orders.
 8) Wal-Mart Canada submits that the Board has already interpreted s.9 of The Trade Union Act very broadly so that its effect violates s. 2(d) of the Charter.
Wal-Mart Canada submits this is evidenced in two ways.
First, by the manner in which the Board has permitted the proceedings to be conducted and second, by the focus of the hearing on the alleged anti-union philosophy of Wal-Mart Canada instead of on whether or not Wal-Mart Canada has in fact influenced its employees to bring their applications against UFCW.
If the Board has interpreted s. 9 of The Trade Union Act in accordance with UFCW's submissions, then such an interpretation appears to be on a collision course with s.2(d) of the Charter of Rights.
If s. 9 of the Act has the effect of restricting freedom of expression between an employee and an employer that does not constitute interference or coercion, then s. 9 may well violate s. 2(d) of the Charter and if not saved by s. 1 of the Charter, is unconstitutional.
However, Wal-Mart Canada's application respecting the constitutionality of s. 9 of the Act is premature in the sense that the Court did not have a sufficient factual foundation or context to properly measure s. 9 of the Act against s. 2(d) of the Charter.","[0, 2, 6, 4, 5, 11, 9, 8, 3]"

Issue: Whether interim injunction should issue in advance of motion for interlocutory injunction.
Result: Interim injunction issued.
Factors in CPR 41.04 satisfied.
In particular, an urgency existed in the sense that the Defendant had resigned only weeks earlier and the opening of the new business was imminent.
The Plaintiff had not had sufficient time to gather all the evidence it wished to present on an interlocutory motion.
Considering all the circumstances, it was just to issue the interim injunction.

Background:[2] The Plaintiff operates the only drug store in the semi-rural community of Berwick.","The appellant was convicted of driving a motor vehicle while his licence was suspended.
The appeal centred upon the adjudicator's acceptance of the police officer's evidence and the reliability of that evidence versus the defence witnesses who testified that the appellant's son was actually the driver of the vehicle.
Appeal allowed; verdict of acquittal entered.
The adjudicator erred by failing to address whether the appellant's evidence raised a reasonable doubt as to his innocence, particularly on the central issue of whether the appellant was the only person present in the vehicle.
But not making a finding on this critical issue, this tended to suggest more strongly that the adjudicator engaged in an either/or analysis in accepting the evidence of the Crown's witnesses over that of the four defence witnesses; the adjudicator should have made clear findings of credibility based on the evidence before him.","[1, 3, 2, 4, 6, 5, 7, 8, 10, 9, 11, 13, 12, 15, 0]"

Heard: October 18, 20, 2011, in Halifax, Nova ScotiaCounsel: D. Mark Gardiner, for the Applicants Myra Jerome, for the Respondents By the Court: Introduction[1] The Bowsers were successful as Respondents in a Chambers application which was heard for a full day on October 18, and a half day on October 20, 2011 - see 2011 NSSC 450 (CanLII).
They claim solicitor client costs, or in the alternative costs under Tariff “C” of $3000 to which they say a multiplier of four should be applied for a total of $12,000 costs plus disbursements of $302.75.
Background[2] On May 12, 2011, the Sheas filed a Notice of Application in Chambers.
Included therewith was the Affidavit of the Sheas sworn November 23, 2010, comprising twenty-three paragraphs and Exhibits “A” through to “U”.
A review of the file confirms that the Bowsers received advice from the scheduling office of this court on May 16 that the hearing had been set for June 23, 2011.","This appeal arises from proceedings under The Family Property Act.
The couple had lived together for several years.
She sought judgment distributing their property.
The property included a house in Vancouver, which he had acquired some years earlier with the financial assistance of his parents.
The trial judge found that the respondent had acquired the house after the commencement of the spousal relationship and then went to hold that the petitioner was entitled to an equal share of its value with no reduction owing to the gifts or loans from his parents.
The respondent appealed.
HELD: Appeal allowed by the majority.
Lane J.A. wrote in dissent.
Majority: 1)
The Vancouver property was acquired after commencement of the spousal relationship.
The value of the property did not qualify for exemption under s. 23(1)(a) of the Act.
There are a number of facts that merit emphasis.
The respondent received $125,000 from his mother before the spousal relationship started.
He still had that amount on hand when the relationship commenced.
He used the money as a down payment on the purchase of the Vancouver house shortly after the relationship commenced.
By establishing these facts, the respondent established the requisite conditions for the grant of an exemption of the value of the Vancouver property to the extent of the $125,000.
2) The trial judge erred in declining to take into account the loans of $100,000 the appellant received from each of his parents for the purpose of purchasing the Vancouver property.
There was insufficient evidence before the trial judge to enable him to find that the mortgage debts were statute-barred and he did not make a firm finding on this point.
The trial judge's finding that the respondent will not have to repay the loans was incomplete.
He did not assess the loans in light of s. 21(3)(e) of the Act.
On the whole of the circumstances concerning the Vancouver property and the length of the spousal relationship, there is no tenable basis for not giving effect to s. 21(3)(e) of the Act and the contributions made by the respondent's parents on his behalf to the acquisition of the property.
The petitioner is entitled to share in the build up of the equity in consequence of the pay-down of the mortgage.
Minority: 1)
The Vancouver home ought to be distributed in accordance with s. 22 of the Act.
The gift of $125,000 was made by the respondent's mother with the full knowledge that the parties were living together.
In this case, the contribution by a third party on behalf of a spouse to the acquisition of family property is one of the usual factors outlined in s. 21 of the Act and it would be inequitable to exempt the gift from distribution. 2)
The trial judge did not err in failing to deduct from the family property the loans given by the appellant's parents.
He made a finding the loans were statute-barred.
The trial judge clearly considered the legislation and his interpretation of the legislation was not challenged by the respondent.
He also made the finding the loans would likely never be repaid.
He simply used less than precise language.","[0, 1, 6, 2, 7, 9, 3, 4]"

Rule 77 and rule 18.16 consideredSummary: The Defendant filed a motion to dismiss discovery subpoenas issued to the Defendant’s witnesses.
The motion was allowed and the Order granted included a direction as to the manner of discovery.
Issue: What costs should be awarded to the Defendant?
Result: The circumstances and factual findings justified an increase in the tariff, for party/party costs.
Further the circumstances warranted an award of Solicitor/client costs in a limited amount.

for the Defendant By the Court:[1] These are reasons for decision in fixing an award of costs to the Defendant, D.R.
[2] My decision, as well, decided the order in which the witnesses at discovery would be examined.
[3] The Defendant has in their submission on costs stated that the actions of the Plaintiff constituted an improper use of discovery subpoenas.
[4] The Defendant submits also that Plaintiff’s counsel has made unwarranted attacks against Defendant’s counsel.","FIAT: The sole issue before the court is the amount to be fixed for the ongoing s. 7 expenses.
The s. 7 expenses claimed by the petitioner include dental work of $112.90 for Kristen, orthodontic work for Brina and costs associated with Brina's post-secondary education.
It is uncontroverted that Brina has disabilities that necessitate certain tools such as a computer for her to be successful in her post-secondary training.
HELD: 1) The respondent accepts responsibility for his proportionate share of the girls' dental and orthodontic expenses and there shall be an order accordingly.
2) The September 2004 consent order provided that computer repairs and equipment were included in Brina's s. 7 expenses.
Accordingly the costs relating to the computer are legitimate s. 7 costs.

and Jason Thomas Cooke, counsel for the Estate of Pauline Hand Moir, J.: [1] Mr. Richard Hand applied for an order that he has a one-half interest in a condominium held jointly by his parents until the death of his mother.
However, by the time the application was heard, Mr. Hand allowed that title passed to the survivor and he contended that his parents made mutual wills supported by an implied promise against revocation, which promise his father breached by making a will in favour of his sister after the death of his mother.
[2] I found that the wills were not mutual and that no agreement against revocation could be implied.
There was also an issue about the failure of the representatives of Mrs. Hand's estate to provide an accounting.
That was resolved, but it was resolved only as the hearing began.
[3] The father, Dr. Robert Hand, sought party and party costs against his son.
They contend that the entire application was a sham and that no lawyer should be paid anything.
He was represented in his personal claim by Mr. Piercey, who had no involvement with the issues about estate accounting.","The Minister sought numerous orders for production of medical and various other files (including the mother's complete medical files from her family physician, the Nova Scotia Hospital and another hospital, and her files from a woman's shelter and an addiction treatment and prevention service) in an ongoing child protection proceeding.
The mother argued that the records sought were irrelevant and that if there was any relevance, they were privileged, were unnecessary to the fair disposition of the proceeding, and their production would not save costs and would be injurious to the public interest.
The addiction prevention and treatment service, Nova Scotia Hospital and mental health clinic records and files are ordered to be produced; the medical records of the family physician, the hospital and the woman's shelter are not ordered to be produced as these files would contain some irrelevant information and the relevant information could be obtained by other means.
In a child protection proceeding, documents may be relevant to prove a protection finding, to monitor compliance with existing orders, or to develop and evaluate a plan of care.
Records held by individuals or organizations to whom an individual has been referred as a result of a child protection proceeding are not privileged as no confidentiality could be expected in those circumstances.
Records held by individuals or organizations whose services were accessed independent of a court order or the Minister's involvement that would ordinarily attract privilege may be ordered to be produced in child protection proceedings.
However, if the information contained in the records can be obtained by a means targeted specifically to produce the relevant information, then orders for production for all of the records will not be necessary to the fair disposition of the proceeding.
Also, since such records contain irrelevant, as well as relevant material, such an order would violate the privacy protections found in the Charter and be injurious to the public interest.","[1, 0, 5, 6, 7, 3, 8, 4, 13, 11]"

Decision:[1] J.E.S., aged 16, pleaded guilty to aggravated assault contrary to s. 268(1) of the Criminal Code.
Nine month’s credit was given for the six months he spent on remand, so the total sentence is, in effect, 21 months, four months of which is non-custodial.
J.E.S.
has appealed his sentence and applies for release pending appeal pursuant to s. 679 of the Criminal Code.
[2] Judge Campbell described the offence in the sentencing decision as follows:The crime here was of potentially lethal violence.
The circumstances surrounding it are, to say the least, perplexing.","This is an application for leave to appeal, and leave being granted, an appeal by the Crown from a sentence imposed against a young offender pursuant to the Youth Criminal Justice Act.
The respondent pled guilty to a charge of robbery, an offence contrary to s. 344(b) of the Criminal Code.
The respondent was sentenced to 90 days secure custody, 45 days community supervision, 1 year probation and a 10 year firearms prohibition.
HELD: Appeal allowed orally.
The sentence is set aside and a sentence of 12 months closed custody, 6 months community supervision, 1 year probation and a 10 year firearms prohibition was imposed in addition to the 90 days closed custody already served at the time of the appeal.
 1) It was clear that the primary concern of the sentencing judge was that, in the wake of the Supreme Court of Canada decision in R. v. B.W.P.; R. v. B.V.N. 2006 SCC 27, a custodial sentence might not be open to him at all.
It is the Court's view that the sentencing judge's conclusion that the decision in B.W.P. virtually ruled out custodial sentences for young persons under the Youth Criminal Justice Act was unwarranted.
The gist of that decision is that under the Act the principle of general deterrence is not a factor to be taken into account and cannot be used to justify a sentence harsher than the circumstances of the offender and the offence would warrant.
Nor is specific deterrence to be considered as a separate factor.
2) It is the Court's view that a long custodial sentence is necessary to accomplish the task of bringing the seriousness of the offence to the respondent's attention, and provide meaningful consequences to reinforce societal values without negatively affecting the respondent's likelihood of rehabilitation.","[0, 2, 4, 5, 1, 7, 6, 9, 12, 11, 13, 16, 15]"

M. Scaravelli Heard: March 5, 2009, in Halifax, Nova Scotia Counsel: Andrew Pavey, for the Applicant Terry D. Potter, for the Respondent By the Court: (Orally)[1] This matter involves an application under Civil Procedure Rules (1972) for an Order in the nature of Mandamus compelling the Respondent, Department of Community Services to comply with an Order of the Income Assistance Appeal Board, dated September 17th, 2007.
Carl Smith, the Applicant, is disabled and has been a long term recipient of income assistance benefits from the Department of Community Services.
[2] Mr. Smith’s income assistance was terminated in May 2006 due to failure to disclose requested information.
His application was again denied based on failure to provide requested information.
He appealed the decision and the appeal was heard by the Assistance Appeal Board on September 6, 2007.
The Board allowed the appeal and found that Mr. Smith was “a person in need” as defined in the Employment Support and Income Assistance Act (ESIA).","The Department of Community Resources (DCR) seeks orders pursuant to The Child and Family Services Act (the Act) placing CS with the Department until age 18 pursuant to s. 37(2) and JS with his grandmother as a Person of Sufficient Interest pursuant to s. 37(1)(b).
With respect to EK the Department seeks an order placing him with the Minister until his 16th birthday.
This order was granted at trial.
The parents do not oppose the applications with respect to JS and EK but the mother seeks the return of CS to her care.
HELD: JS is in need of protection and he shall be placed with SK for an indefinite period.
JS shall not be returned to live with his parents without a further order of this Court.
This does not prevent JS from spending unsupervised time with his parents including overnight visits.
CS is in need of protection and she shall remain in the custody of the Minister for a period of 3 months.
During that time, the parents shall work with DCR to develop a case plan for CS's return.
TK will have a mental health assessment as arranged for by DCR and will follow any recommendations of the mental health professional and participate in the Victim Intervention Program.
KS will attend any session at Alternatives to Violence arranged for by DCR.
1) The Court was satisfied that the children were exposed to domestic violence or severe domestic disharmony.
2) Matters did not move quickly once the children were placed in the care of DCR.
Instead of working with DCR to ensure a smooth reintegration of the children into their home, the parents vacated their apartment, moved to Alberta for a while, lived in a series of motels, camped at SK's apartment building and even lived in a tent.
During that period of time, some of which encompassed the trial, the Court was not satisfied that there was an adult person who was willing and able to provide for the children's needs.
The children are in need of protection within the meaning of s. 11 of the Act.
3) There is a reasonable prospect of change within a reasonable period of time.
KS has quit drinking.
TK is now employed.
KS has attended some anger management programming flowing from his criminal conviction.
The parents have a residence.
TK is taking medication which promotes the continuation of her mental health.
DCR acknowledged that there are no current issues with TK's mental health and that have not been for some time.
TK says she is prepared to work with DCR to ensure the return of her children.
The Court accepts TK's disinclination to work with Ms. Fraser.

- On behalf of the Applicant Celia J. Melanson Esq.
- On behalf of the RespondentTHE APPLICATION: This is an application for custody of the child, David Douglas Tunnillie, born August 28, 1992 in Cape Dorset, Nunavut and the parties are the natural parents of the child.
On November 24, 1999 following a written decision the Court issued an Order that it would take jurisdiction and hear the application under S. 18 of the Family Maintenance Act.
There has been what may appear to be an unreasonable period of time from the date of the application to the decision of the Court.
The problem has been with translation services and obtaining a translator in Inuktitut, in Nova Scotia.
Due to the unavailability of this service the Respondent has given evidence in Nunavut and a translated transcript has been received.
THE FACTS: The child David was born August 28, 1992, and prior to this in 1991 the parties resided together in Iqualuit.
The Applicant is the father of the child and moved away from Nunavut before he knew the Respondent was pregnant with their child.","The appellants were found guilty of breaching a rural municipal bylaw which provides 'That no poultry or livestock be permitted in districts zoned Hamlet [sic].'
There were four grounds of appeal: 1) an application to admit new evidence on appeal; 2) a constitutional challenge seeking a declaration that the bylaw was ultra vires for uncertainty; 3) the significance of the word 'hamlet' in the bylaw; and 4) the meaning of the word 'livestock' in the bylaw.
HELD: The appeal is dismissed.
1) New evidence will not be admitted on an appeal if, by due diligence, it could have been adduced at trial.
Further, new evidence will be admitted only if it bears upon a decisive or potentially decisive issue in the trial.
Neither of these requirements is met.
2) The constitutional challenge is not properly before the Court as notice is required when the constitutionality of a bylaw is impugned.
In any event, the uncertainty on which the appellants rely in attacking the bylaw does not exist.
3) The appellants misunderstand the use of the word 'hamlet' in the bylaw.
4) Whatever definition of 'livestock' is used, the definition always includes cattle.","[0, 1, 2, 3, 6, 13, 9, 7, 8, 11, 10, 14]"

The action itself was not issued until July 18, 1997.
It was served on November 4, 1997 on the defendant, Howard LeLacheur and provided to Judgment Recovery on January 23, 1998.
On February 23,1998, a defence was filed by Judgment Recovery on behalf of the defendant.","The defendant council, charged with the general oversight and administration of matters under the Natural Products Marketing Act, delegated certain authority to commodity boards such as the plaintiff.
The plaintiff requested that the defendant hold a show cause hearing to determine whether certain producers had contravened their licence but when a procedural breakdown occurred as to how that hearing would be conducted, with the plaintiff seeking and being denied an adjournment, the hearing was held without the plaintiff's participation.
The plaintiff brought an application for mandamus to compel the defendant to hold a new hearing and filed two affidavits providing some detail and background information as to its reasoning for its failure to attend the hearing and the parties' differing positions regarding their respective roles in the application of the management plan.
The defendant brought an application to strike certain of the affidavits filed by the plaintiff on the basis that they were an attempt to put evidence to the court on matters not forming part of the record.
Application to strike affidavits dismissed;
the Rules do not preclude the admission of affidavits on an application and, in the present circumstances, reason and fairness militated against ruling the affidavits inadmissible.
There was no authority for denying the parties the use of affidavits should this application proceed as a jurisdictional dispute and, should it proceed by way of an error of law on the face of the record, the affidavits were also admissible to complete the record.","[0, 5, 7, 3, 2, 6, 1]"

:I.
If the redress under that statutory cause of action is thought to be inadequate, the cure must be legislative, not judicial.
(I will refer to the plaintiffs collectively as the appellants and to Mr. MacDonald as the respondent).
[4] The appellants’ action is based on two Nova Scotia statutes.
[5] The first statute under which the appellants sue is the Fatal Injuries Act, R.S.N.S.
This claim is not directly in issue on this appeal.
Under that Act, a defined group of persons, including the deceased’s parents, may claim for damages against a wrongdoer who caused the deceased’s death.
[6] The second statute under which the appellants claim is the Survival of Actions Act, R.S.N.S.
Under that Act, any right to sue in negligence which Paul would have had, if he had not been killed, survives for the benefit of his estate.
However, the Act limits the type of damages which may be recovered by the estate to those which have resulted in “actual pecuniary loss to the estate”.
The restriction of damages to “actual pecuniary loss to the estate” and the exclusion of damages for loss of expectation of life are at the heart of this appeal.","The estate applied to have the court find that a large number of bank shares which had been gratuitously transferred by the deceased to her great niece were being held in trust for the deceased.
Following discovery examinations, the great niece, who was the alternative executor appointed under the will, applied to have the executor, the deceased's husband, removed on the basis that his discovery evidence raised grave concerns about his mental capacity to continue to act as executor.
Application to remove the executor dismissed;
there was no medical evidence submitted in support of the applicant's claim that the executor was not competent to administer the estate and although it was clear from the discovery evidence that he did not have a clear understanding of his duties as executor, given that he was the only beneficiary under the will, he was the only person whose interest was at risk if he failed to properly administer the estate.","[2, 16, 24, 14, 8, 29, 5, 13, 18, 19, 26, 27]"

to investigate the matters.
[3] In the conduct of the investigation, Mr. Stratton arranged to have statements taken from former residents of the institutions.
He employed Facts-Probe Incorporated, operated by Harry Murphy and Mr. Murphy's son Duane, to obtain these statements.
[4] At the conclusion of Mr. Stratton's investigation he filed his final report.
A key recommendation of that report was that an alternative dispute resolution (ADR) process be established whereby former residents claiming to have been abused could be compensated for that abuse.
[5] Mr. Harry Murphy described in paras.
5, 6, 7, 8 and 9 of his affidavit the assurances given to former residents as follows:5.
Throughout the Stratton Investigation, Duane and I assured victims that the investigation was a confidential process and that their statements would not be circulated elsewhere without their permission.
Issues and assurances related to confidentiality were normally dealt with as a preliminary matter prior to any interviews.
No written guarantee of confidentiality was provided, nor was any written form of release used or obtained during the Stratton Investigation.
During the Stratton investigation, from December 1994 to June 1995, I reported only to Justice Stratton.
A copy of that Report is attached to my Affidavit as Exhibit ""B"".","This appeal arises from a dispute between the appellant, Dr. Huerto and the respondent Government of Saskatchewan, over the payment for medical services provided by Dr. Huerto to his patients.
Over a period of approximately 10 years, the Government withheld payment in relation to what eventually amounted to some 12,000 of the appellant's accounts.
The Government indicated through the use of a billing code, that the accounts would not be paid until further information was provided.
The appellant believed the use of the billing code was unlawful and chose not to provide additional information.
He started an action in the Court of Queen's Bench to compel payment of his accounts.
His claim was largely dismissed on the basis that the action was premature.
The appellant appeals from the Queen's Bench ruling and the Government cross-appeal in relation to the limited aspect of the case in which Dr. Huerto enjoyed success.
HELD: Appeal and Cross-appeal dismissed.
 1) Section 17(1)(c) of The Saskatchewan Medical Care Insurance Act is to the effect that the intention and purpose of the Act is not to establish a medical care insurance plan under which 'the exercise of professional judgment by physicians is in any way diminished'.
This broad statement of principle should not be read so aggressively as to mean the Government, as the payor in a publicly funded health care system, has no right to ask questions about the accounts presented for payment by physicians.
The Government has not denied payment of the appellant's accounts.
Nor has it received the requested information from the appellant.
The actions (the Protocol) taken by the Government cannot be characterized as an amendment of the Payment Schedule.
The Protocol is an administrative tool which sets out the situations in which the appellant will be asked for further information about the provision of specific services.
This is fully in line with the terms of the Schedule. 2) Section 5(1) of the Regulations should not be read as meaning the Government is entitled to ask for additional information about a service if, and only if, the nature of the service is 'unusual'.
Rather, it simply stipulates that additional remarks must be included in an account rendered with respect to an unusual service.
This does not imply the government can request extra information only in relation to an unusual service.
A physician's obligation to include certain material in an account and the Government's authority to ask for additional information are ultimately two quite different things.
3) The Court does not accept that the appellant's claims were barred by s. 16(1) of the Act.
It would be perverse to read the Act as requiring that, in order for an account to be paid, every bit of information demanded by the Government through the use of a billing code, or otherwise, must be supplied before the expiration of the 6 month period established by the Regulations.
An account submitted the day before the expiration of the 6 month deadline would be voided by the application of the billing code.
An account submitted well in advance of the expiration of the 6 month period would also be effectively denied if a request for further information was not made until at or near the end of the six month time limit, with the result that there was insufficient time for a physician to respond before that limit was exceeded.
These potential problems are especially troublesome because there is an element of subjectivity in the application of the Protocol and even the most diligent physician might not accurately anticipate when an account or accounts will attract a request for extra comment.
4) The Court cannot accept the Government's submission that the trial judge should have declined to deal with the appellant's claim because the appellant had not fully pursued possible appeals to the Medical assessment Board.
The Legislature in s. 40(3) of the Act has expressly provided that the appeal procedure established pursuant to the Act does not prejudice a physician's right to pursue matters in the courts.
It stands entirely at odds with the notion that the appeal procedures in the Act should be read as being comprehensive and exhaustive.","[5, 10, 1, 16, 18, 13, 19, 27, 25, 31, 24, 14, 17, 20]"

Michael MacDonald on October 10, 1995Oral Decision: November 1, 1995Written Release of Decision: November 14, 1995Counsel: Barry Mien for the Appellant Wayne Harvey for Respondent The respondent owns several buildings on Robie Street in the City of Halifax.
These one time family homes have been converted into apartment units.
In the spring of 1994 the respondent's proposal to replace these buildings with a high density apartment complex was rejected by Halifax City Council.
In response the respondent repainted the buildings in a haphazard and multi‑coloured fashion.
They are an eye‑sore.
Following complaints from nearby property owners, the respondent was charged with ""owning unsightly properties"" contrary to the provisions of the Halifax City Charter.
On the 2nd of February, 1995, Judge Sandra Oxner, following a trial of the matter, acquitted the respondent of all charges.
The Crown now appeals to this Court.
The Crown raises two grounds on appeal.
They are: 1.","The parties entered into a handwritten agreement with regard to the feeding and maintenance of 100 cows.
The plaintiff was to provide labour and the necessary equipment to feed and maintain the cows for $.50 per cow per day.
The defendant was to provide the feed and medicine.
At paragraph 6 the contract stipulated that the plaintiff was to receive a bonus for each live calf that he got to pasture.
The amount of the bonus was left blank.
The plaintiff sues the defendant, claiming a bonus for the 2004-2005 year and the 2005-2006 year.
HELD: The claim is dismissed.
In law an agreement to come to an agreement is not enforceable.
This is especially true where an essential term regarding remuneration has not been agreed to.

[2] An Agreed Statement of Facts has been filed by the parties and I now set it forth: 1.
This action arises out of a motor vehicle / bicycle accident which occurred on June 27, 2002.
The late Jonathan Hartling was driving his bicycle on the road when he was struck from behind and killed.
2.
The Plaintiff Alicia Hartling was Jonathan Hartling’s cousin.
She was present, although she did not suffer any physical injuries and was not directly involved in the accident, she commenced this action to advance a claim for nervous shock.
It is admitted that the Plaintiff is entitled to recover damages for nervous shock from the Defendant LeBlanc.
3.
Since the Defendant LeBlanc was an uninsured motorist at the time of the accident, the Plaintiff’s claim against LeBlanc is being defended by the Facility Association which maintains the Uninsured Motorist Claims Fund for Nova Scotia.
4.
5.
Jonathan Hartling was a “person insured under the contract”.
6.
Alicia Hartling was neither a resident of nor a dependant of the Brightman household, therefore, it is agreed that the Plaintiff Alicia was not a “person insured under the contract”.
The Plaintiff’s claim has been settled between the parties.","FIAT: The defendant applies pursuant to Rule 41(1) and Rule 215(1) of the Queen's Bench Rules and the inherent jurisdiction of the Court for an order severing the issues of liability and assessment of damages in the plaintiff's claim.
They ask that disclosure, discoveries and the trial ought to proceed to determine whether the defendants are liable to the plaintiffs and to what extent.
Then, if liability is found, disclosure, discoveries and the trial should proceed to assess damages.
The defendant also seeks an order pursuant to Rule 173 of the Queen's Bench Rules striking a paragraph of the plaintiff's claim.
HELD: 1) Authority to sever trials in Saskatchewan is founded on the Court's inherent jurisdiction.
Laing C.J.Q.B. reviewed the discretion available to the Court in Chaban v. Kramer Ltd., 2008 SKQB 27.
Upon considering the factors in Chaban, it must be concluded that the defendants' application has merit.
There is clear severability between the threshold issue of liability and the consequential issue of damages in the plaintiffs' action.
The entitlement to sue for disgorgement of profits hinges on whether the defendant, as the plaintiff's former employee, was in a position of a fiduciary.
Disclosure pertaining to the defendants' ongoing business, financial affairs and clientele become relevant only upon a finding of liability.
The Court may exercise its discretion only if the court can make a finding that the defendants will suffer severe prejudice if the issues of liability and damages are not bifurcated.
Much of the defendants' client base results from a joint venture with a major accounting firm.
This joint venture requires confidentiality.
Disclosure of these relationships would jeopardize the defendants' obligation to maintain this confidence.
Serious prejudice to the defendants in the instant case has been established.
It is appropriate to exercise the Court's discretion in the defendants favour and grant the order severing the plaintiffs' claim against them.
The application to sever the threshold issue of liability from damages only pertains to the plaintiffs' claim.
The defendants' counterclaim against the plaintiffs and their two principals shall continue in the normal course.
2) The defendants' application to strike portions of the plaintiffs' statement of claim is dismissed.
The paragraphs refer to Wolff being an applied science technologist and holding himself out as a person with a strong sense of ethics.
The plaintiffs plead that the code of ethics for an applied science technologist provides that a person with such a designation will not 'use directly or indirectly an employer's or client's confidential information' in competition with the client and alleges that Wolff has breached the code of ethics.
While Wolff may be subject to discipline by his governing body, that does not constitute a multiplicity of proceedings as defined by s. 29 of The Queen's Bench Act.
The facts pled are material facts relevant to the plaintiff's claim of Wolff's breach of fiduciary duty and breach of contract.","[2, 0, 3, 8, 5, 6, 4, 7, 9, 11, 14, 13, 18, 15, 10, 16]"

HELD: Application dismissed.
The Court will not set aside the order nisi for judicial sale on the basis that the application for leave was premature or that the statement of claim was not noted for default.
However, the application for confirmation of the sale is premature as the property is to be listed for 6 months.
There does not appear on the evidence to be a sale to be confirmed.
The plaintiff is prepared to make an offer, but does not appear to have done so.
The draft bill of costs submitted contains numerous items which occurred prior to the granting of leave and there is no order from the Court authorizing pre-leave costs, nor any evidence as to why the Court might consider pre-leave costs.
On a renewed application for confirmation of judicial sale, it would be preferable to have evidence directly from the listing agent setting out the steps taken to market the property and detailing for the Court any offers received.
There will be no costs awarded for this unsuccessful application.","[5, 6, 3, 7, 0, 1, 11, 21, 8, 16, 18]"

This action involves a contest between two insurance companies.
It results from the loss by fire of a residence owned by Michael and Diane Brown which was subject to a mortgage in favour of Canada Trustco Mortgage Company.
At the time of the fire loss, there were in place two policies of insurance for the purpose of indemnifying Canada Trustco.
In advancing their claim against one insured, Canada Trustco failed to disclose the existence of the second policy.
One policy had been placed by the Owners/Mortgagors, Mr. and Mrs. Brown, and protected both their interests and the interests of the Mortgagee.
This policy was placed with The Co‑operators General Insurance Company.
The second policy was placed by Canada Trustco to protect its own interests as Mortgagee and was put in place as a result of notice that the Co-op policy was being cancelled by Co‑op.
This latter policy was placed with Marsh & McLennan and is a subscription policy.
Under the terms of the arrangement between Canada Trustco and Marsh & McLennan, coverage was put in place on the basis of notice from the mortgage company.

The young person would not suffer unnecessary hardship as he was able to attend high school classes several times per week in the youth facility while he awaited his appeal and, even if his appeal was successful, he would only have served four months custody before it was heard.

That company assigned its agreement with Eastside to Direct Cash and their subsequent contractual relationship is the subject matter of this dispute.
[5] In November of 2005, Direct Cash commenced an action for breach of contract against Eastside in the Alberta Court of Queen’s Bench.
Eastside did not file a defence and consequently Direct Cash obtained default judgment for an amount not cited in either parties’ submissions.

It appears Direct Cash’s claim was reduced from the amount of its judgment to fall within the monetary limits established by the Small Claims Court Act (the Act).

:This is an appeal by Deborah Lynn Irving, from the granting of, uncontested, divorce and corollary relief judgments.
INTRODUCTION:The parties were married October 20, 1990.
A separation agreement, which was incorporated into the corollary relief judgment, was executed by the parties on November 6 and 7, 1996.
According to the divorce petition the parties separated on August 21, 1996.
The divorce and corollary relief judgments were granted on February 11, 1997.
The appellant asks this Court to set aside the judgments on the basis that the underlying separation agreement is ""unconscionable and unduly harsh.""
In this regard she has applied to the court to admit fresh evidence bearing upon the circumstances leading up to the divorce.
The regularity of the divorce proceeding itself is not in question.
During this separation the appellant was involved with her current common law partner, but had sexual relations with the respondent, allegedly under pressure from him.","FIAT: This is an application for an order pursuant to s. 63(2) of The Personal Property Security Act requiring the respondents or those in possession to deliver to the applicant four pieces of construction equipment.
The four pieces of equipment were rented by applicant, Inland, to respondents, Mike Dery Holdings Ltd. and Giants Head Excavating Ltd. pursuant to an equipment rental contract entered into at Penticton, British Columbia, between April 21, 2008 and August 6, 2008.
Inland did not register any security interest in the equipment in British Columbia or Saskatchewan until October 20, 2009.
In the fall of 2008, the equipment was transported to Saskatchewan by Mike Dery Holdings Ltd. and/or Giants Head.
In February of 2009, respondent 101138096 purchased the equipment from Mike Dery Holdings Ltd. and Giants Head for valuable consideration.
Searches were completed to establish no registrations against the equipment.
In April of 2009, the equipment was leased to Giants Head and a security agreement registered in Saskatchewan on May 5, 2009 listing the equipment as general property but not specifically registering the equipment by serial number.
The security agreement was taken by 101138096 to secure the rental payments owed to it under the lease by Giants Head who had possession of the equipment.
Mike Dery Holdings Ltd. and Giants Head defaulted under their payments to Inland and Giants Head defaulted in its payments to 101138096.
September 18, 2009, 101138096 seized the equipment leaving it in the possession of Giants Head.
The equipment was subsequently removed from Giants Head's possession and stored at the farm of Bruce Bakken.
On October 19, 2009, 101138096 forwarded a letter to Giants Head confirming that 101138096 had elected to retain the equipment as payment for the outstanding indebtedness.
As of this date a Personal Property Security registry search in Saskatchewan disclosed no security interest other than that of 101138096 in the equipment.
Inland subsequently registered both a British Columbia and Saskatchewan Personal Property registry interest by serial number respecting the equipment and its original agreements of 2008.
The issue before the Court is whether Inland by virtue of its Personal Property Security registration by serial number on October 20, 2009 has priority over the interest of 101138096 which registered earlier as general security without serial numbers but who alleges to have taken possession of the equipment and elected to retain the equipment seized in satisfaction of Giants Head's indebtedness October 19, 2009.
This occurred one day prior to the registration of the security interest by serial number of Inland.
HELD: The application is dismissed with costs to the respondents.
The respondent 101138096 had a general security registered and had actual possession of the equipment in early October 2009 which therefore perfected its security while it retained possession.
As of October 19, 2009 when 101138096 elected to take the collateral as satisfaction of the debt the only party to whom notice was required was the debtor Giants Head and his notice is in compliance with s. 61(1) and s. 61(3) of the Act.
When the applicant completed its registration on October 20, 2009 the collateral was no longer available because of 101138096's election on October 19, 2009.
The respondent perfected its security interest in the equipment which is subject to this application by taking possession thereof.
Electing to take the collateral as satisfaction of the obligation secured and providing the required notices prior to registration by the applicant, transferred title to the equipment to the respondent 101138096 free and clear of the claim of the applicant.","[2, 3, 6, 0, 10, 13, 12, 5, 14, 1, 4, 11, 15, 7, 27]"

LAW [4] In Marshall v. Curry (No.
This decision was subsequently affirmed (see pp.","The accused was charged with aggravated assault and mischief.
The evidence on the aggravated assault was that the accused had struck the victim in the face with a plastic candle holder.
The victim suffered significant injury to his face and eye, which was still noticeable 6 weeks later.
The victim testified that the accused had been drinking and the parties got into an argument.
The victim touched the accused on the back in an effort to calm her down and she spun around and struck the victim in the face with the candle holder.
The accused gave a warned statement and testified at trial that she believed she had backhanded the victim with her fist.
In her warned statement, she qualified her denial by saying that her recollection was not clear and that she didn't really remember.
The evidence on the mischief was that when the police attended to the residence after the victim had gone by ambulance to hospital and the accused was standing in front of the house in front of a broken window.
HELD: The accused was convicted of aggravated assault.
The inescapable conclusion from the evidence is that the accused struck the victim in the face with the candle holder.
The accused's version that she struck the victim with her fist is not believable when considered in the context of her qualified denials about hitting him with the candle holder, her level of intoxication and the significance of the injury inflicted on the victim.
When an individual intentionally strikes another in the face with a hard plastic object, it is objectively foreseeable that wounding, maiming or disfiguring of the victim may result.
The accused was acquitted of the mischief charge because there was no direct evidence that she had broken the window and there was no evidence that the window was not broken prior to the offence date.","[6, 2, 7, 4, 11, 5, 10, 1, 12, 8, 16, 21, 13]"

The appellant wife took issue with this division, citing several purported errors by the judge.
The respondent husband also cross-appealed.
He too sought a more favourable division of assets.
He also claims, for the first time on appeal, an entitlement to the appellant’s health care coverage.
[2] Both parties, as self-represented litigants, sought to introduce fresh evidence on appeal.
[3] Having carefully reviewed the record together with the parties’ submissions, I conclude there is no basis for admitting any of the proposed fresh evidence on appeal.
This evidence was either readily available at trial, irrelevant, or both.
Furthermore, I conclude that the judge committed no reversible error.
I would dismiss both the appeal and the cross-appeal without costs.
BACKGROUND[4] The parties are from the State of Illinois.
[5] Unfortunately, after selling their Chicago home and while still in the process of transporting their belongings to Nova Scotia, the parties separated.
This was in March of 2001.
That same month the appellant filed for a divorce in Nova Scotia.
[6] The trial was held in Truro on January 17, 2003.
The primary contest related to the division of assets.
A second related issue involved the proceeds from the sale of the Chicago property.","The applicant was a student at the University of Saskatchewan in the College of Medicine.
He was required to discontinue his studies for failure to meet academic standards for promotion.
The applicant appealed his dismissal and was unsuccessful throughout.
He applied to the Court for an order of certiorari to quash the decision of the Academic Appeals Committee and the University Bylaws Committee Council and an order reinstating him as a student at the College of Medicine pending resolution of his appeal.
HELD: The Court found that the Bylaws Committee Council exceeded its jurisdiction by reviewing the previous decisions made and drawing the conclusion that they were made fairly and properly.
The Bylaw Committee determined the merits of the applicant's appeal and determined that it was not necessary to convene a full appeal board.
There is nothing in the University policy to suggest that the Bylaws Committee has that power.
The Bylaws Committee has exceeded its jurisdiction in this regard and its decision is quashed.
The matter is returned to the Bylaws Committee to determine whether the applicant's appeal falls within the policy on student appeals and academic matters.
The portion of the application requesting reinstatement of the applicant as a student pending the resolution of his appeal is dismissed.
The applicant has a marginal academic record and there are a limited number of placements in the College of Medicine.
It does not make sense to displace another student or require the College of Medicine to train a marginal student on a potentially temporary basis.","[2, 5, 6, 3, 11, 9, 12, 13, 7, 10, 8, 14, 20, 23, 22, 19, 21, 25]"

Stewart on June 10, 1998, Special Chambers, 2:00 p.m.DECISION: July 9, 1998COUNSEL: Joel Fichaud, Q.C., for the plaintiff Michael Moreash,for the defendant Stewart, J.:The plaintiff, Canada Trustco Mortgage Company, (""Canada Trust""), a municipal tax payer paid its property taxes as assessed for the years 1994, 1995, 1996 but on appeal was held entitled to a refund for each of the three years in the total amount of $420,177.13.
Canada Trust, pursuant to s. 41(i) of the Judicature Act, R.S.N.S., 1989, c. 240 seeks payment of interest on this amount from the date of the payments and stresses it does not seek the alternative remedy of entitlement to the interest based on unjust enrichment.
The facts are not in issue.
Canada Trust, a municipal taxpayer, in the City of Dartmouth, now Halifax Regional Municipality (""HRM""), the defendant, was assessed for municipal property taxes on fourteen multi-unit residential properties.
As required by the Assessment Act, R.S.N.S., 1989, c. 23, Canada Trust paid its taxes as assessed.
It appealed its assessments for the years 1994, 1995 and 1996 inclusive.","The accused plead guilty to two counts of sexual assault.
The victims were his granddaughters.
The assaults were alleged to have occurred between 1983 and 1991.
A sentencing hearing was held because there was significant disagreement on the facts.
The Crown alleged three aggravating factors: 1) that the sexual assaults were numerous, 2) that the accused touched the victims directly on their skin and not just on their clothing and 3) that there was digital penetration by the accused on both victims.
HELD: At a sentencing hearing, the Crown must prove aggravating factors beyond a reasonable doubt.
The Court held that the two victims were sexually assaulted by the accused on numerous occasions over a period of a number of years.
The Court was satisfied these sexual assaults were a common occurrence on every occasion that the accused was in the company of his granddaughters.
The Court found that the accused touched the victims under their clothing on numerous occasions and that there were a couple of occasions that the accused digitally penetrated each victim.
Finally, the Court concluded that the accused got bolder over time and took more liberties and chances with his victims.","[4, 2, 3, 5, 0, 1]"

The appellant also argued that the trial judge erred in preferring the evidence of the Crown's witness over his own.

Since the order being appealed from was not a Part II order under SCNA, what was being appealed was a procedural order under Queen’s Bench Rule 173 and the inherent jurisdiction of the Court, and therefore the Court had jurisdiction to hear the appeal pursuant to ss. 7 and 8 of the Court of Appeal Act.
The Court held with respect to the decision in Chambers that the judge properly exercised her discretion and did not err in refusing to grant the stay requested.
The Chambers judge appropriately balanced the factors respecting the fairness of allowing re-litigation and determined in all of the circumstances that it would not be unfair to the appellant to allow the SCNA application to succeed because the purpose of that legislation was different and had a wider ambit of The Residential Tenancies Act.
However, the result of this appeal could not be taken to have decided whether a public officer’s actions pursuant to a statutory power could be an abuse of process or that an application under The Residential Tenancies Act to terminate a tenancy by the director and subsequent SCNA application respecting the same residence may never be questioned in any circumstances.","[7, 4, 1, 9, 8, 10, 2, 5, 6, 15, 18, 12]"

The trial judge had found that both parties had exhibited a lack of interest in their child and there was little to distinguish either of them as the better custodial parent.
As the mother had facilitated the father's access to the child and he had not demonstrated the same willingness and that the most important relationship in the child's life was with his sister, who resides with the mother, the trial judge found that it was in the child's best interest to foster that relationship and grant custody to the mother.

48 Introduction[1] This is a decision in the matter of Nicolas Grady and Gallegos Grady.
A divorce hearing was held on October 13, 2009 and November 2, 2009.
The parties have effected a division of their former matrimonial property.
They concluded an agreement, described in its body as a “separation agreement/minutes of settlement” on October 22, 2008.
Herein, the document will be referred to as a separation agreement.
The agreement was registered with the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia on June 17, 2009.
Background to the Relationship[2] The parties were married August 19, 1995 and separated May 15, 2006.
It provided for a shared parenting arrangement.
It is agreed, however, that since May of 2009, the children have been primarily resident with the Respondent mother.
At paragraph 1 it states:1.
(see para 15 of his affidavit, being exhibit 3).","There was contradictory evidence regarding the central issue of consent and therefore the court had to assess credibility.
The complainant’s action of fleeing the situation was found to be consistent with both not consenting and with regret, humiliation and embarrassment.
The evidence of the accused’s witnesses was found to raise a reasonable doubt about the complainant’s non-consent.
The court concluded that the complainant was not as intoxicated as she said; for example, she had a conversation with the accused’s sister.
Therefore, the court was also not satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt that the complainant was incapable of consenting due to her level of intoxication.
It was unnecessary for the court to consider whether the accused had an honest but mistaken belief in consent.
The accused was found not guilty.","[5, 4, 2, 1, 7, 6, 3, 8, 9, 14, 26, 10, 12, 19, 15, 36, 16, 20, 13]"
561,"IN THE SUPREME COURT OF NOVA SCOTIA (FAMILY DIVISION) Citation: Jeffrey v Jeffrey, 2009 NSSC 180Date: 20090615 Docket: S.H.
No.
The couple married in July of 1976 and ceased living together around the end of August of 2001.
Since the separation, Ryan has continued to live with his mother.
[2] In October of 2007, Ms. Jeffrey made an application under the Maintenance and Custody Act.
[3] In January of 2009, a Consent Order was issued which dealt with most of the issues.
As a result, the only remaining issue was, as acknowledged in the Consent Order, the retroactivity of child maintenance (table and section 7 expenses) for the period from August, 2001, to and including December, 2007.
HISTORY[4] As previously noted, the parties separated in August of 2001.
Prior to the Consent Order issued in January of 2009, there was no written agreement or court order dealing with child maintenance.
[5] In September of 2001 – a little over a month after their separation – Mr. Jeffrey began providing Ms. Jeffrey with monthly child maintenance which continues to the date of this hearing.
[8] Ms. Jeffrey further stipulates that Mr. Jeffrey, since separation, has basically refused to provide any contribution towards legitimate special or extraordinary expenses related to their son.","The appeal was allowed, and rather than order a new trial, the charge was stayed.
The issues were decided as follows: 1) the trial judge was found to have applied the wrong test as to de facto care and control of the vehicle.
The appeal on the first ground was dismissed, however, because the Crown could rely on the presumption in s. 258(1)(c);
the accused had been driving 10 minutes before the stop and within two hours of the breath tests, so whether he was in de facto care and control at the time of the stop was irrelevant and did not result in a miscarriage of justice;
2) there was no evidence of the failure to observe the appellant while the breath tests were administered, nor was there a suggestion of the significance of the failure to do so, therefore, the appeal on that ground was dismissed;
3) the trial judge also addressed the issue of evidence if the 2008 amendments did not apply and the appellant was therefore not prejudiced in this regard.
The appellant nonetheless argued that the trial judge erred in law by misapprehending evidence.
The appeal court concluded that the trial judge did not err in law because his reasons did not disclose that he failed to consider relevant evidence relating to a material issue;
 4) the Crown conceded that the 2008 amendments did not apply retroactively.
The appeal court found that the trial judge was incorrect in giving a strong message to the unrepresented appellant that there was no point in tendering evidence on the accuracy of the Intoxilyzer results.
The trial judge’s comments strongly suggested that the only expert evidence that would be relevant would be with respect to equipment malfunction and not operator error.
The appeal was granted on this ground because the trial judge’s comments were found to compromise trial fairness resulting in an error of law;
5) the s. 9 Charter breach was not raised by the appellant at trial but it was raised in his brief following trial, and therefore the appeal court found that the trial judge was obliged to decide whether or not to consider the issue.
The appeal was also allowed on this ground because the trial judge did not comply with his duty to consider the issue and the appeal court could not determine whether the failure to give reasons resulted in a miscarriage of justice;
and 6) there was no issue of trial fairness.
The appeal court concluded that there would be prejudice to the integrity of the justice system that would be manifested if the appellant had a fourth trial.
Nine and a half years passed since the offence date and the facts of the case were less serious than some drinking and driving cases.
Also, there was no other remedy available to remedy the wrong.
The balancing of interests also led the court to conclude that this was one of those clearest of cases calling for a stay of proceedings.","[1, 5, 0, 7, 10, 8, 9, 11, 4, 3, 18]"

HELD: The Court sentenced Klemenz to 12 years imprisonment for breaking and entering and committing the offence of aggravated sexual assault.
He was given credit for 22 months spent in custody.
Matychuk was sentenced to 12 years in prison but was given credit for time in custody on a 1:1 basis because the Court had not found any circumstances to justify any greater amount of credit.

The accused was found not guilty.
The court found that the accused’s s. 8 Charter rights had been breached.
After applying the Grant analysis, the court decided that the breach was serious and that the unreasonable search affected the accused’s privacy, liberty and dignity because the accused did not invite the officer into her house, she was followed by the officer throughout her home and then handcuffed outside her home in full public view.
The court concluded that society’s interests to be free from police interference in their own home without proper judicial authorization supported the exclusion of the evidence.
Regarding the impaired driving charge, the accused was found not guilty because of insufficient evidence.","[3, 7, 6, 4, 14, 2, 5, 10, 11, 16, 8, 9, 15, 19, 17]"

Gilbert’s claim against Chrysler was that it was vicariously liable for the negligence of Giffin.
The insurer was not a participant in the motion or on this appeal.
[3] Gilbert and Giffin both appeal to this Court alleging that the Chambers judge erred in granting Chrysler’s motion.
[4] For the reasons which I will now develop, I would dismiss both appeals with costs to Chrysler.","The 53-year-old plaintiff suffered a neck injury (cervical dystonia) in a car accident.

He was rendered permanently disabled from all work for which he was trained and could no longer work the farm, sawmill or Christmas tree operation he had developed.
Assessing non-pecuniary damages at $60,000.
In assessing pecuniary damages, the court accepted the defendant's expert evidence which led to the conclusion the plaintiffs businesses were marginally profitable.
The defendants were ordered to pay $30,000 as real, net loss of future income.
The court approved a 5% capitalization rate as being appropriate where there was an eight year term to age 65.
The plaintiff settled his future Section B benefits just before trial.
The court rejected the defence argument that they were entitled to a credit for present value of those benefits which represented a figure over seven times the settlement figure.
The defendants were only entitled to a credit for sums actually paid to the plaintiff.
The court rejected the plaintiff's actuarial report as being late and in breach of Civil Procedure Rule 31.08.","[1, 7, 5, 8, 11, 6, 9, 0, 3, 16, 13, 14, 15, 17, 22, 24, 21, 12, 23]"

Jamieson, for the respondent Robertson, J.:[1] This appeal arises from a decision of David Johnson, Adjudicator in the Provincial Court of Nova Scotia, who convicted the appellant for driving a motor vehicle while his license was suspended contrary to s. 287(2) of the Motor Vehicle Act, F.S.N.S.
1989, c. 293, as amended.
The offence occurred on February 13, 2003.
[2] The appellant plead not guilty and the trial was held on May 17, 2004.
Following written submissions, the decision was delivered on September 27, 2004.
[3] At the trial, the Crown called one witness, Constable Guy Napier of the Halifax Regional Police Force.
[5] The grounds of appeal are:1.
The Honourable Adjudicator erred in not properly interpreting the provisions of s. 287(2) of the Motor Vehicle Act, R.S.N.S.
1989, c. 298, as amended;2.
The Honourable Adjudicator erred by relying solely upon the evidence of only one Crown witness, a police officer, and apparently rejecting in total the evidence of the Appellant and three other civilian witnesses;3.
The Honourable Adjudicator erred by failing to give the benefit of reasonable doubt to the Appellant;4.
The verdict was unreasonable and cannot be supported by the evidence;5.
There was insufficient evidence to prove that the Appellant was in fact the driver of a motor vehicle driving while suspended;6.","Appeal from 107 SaskR 135, 44 RFL(3d)185.
Appeal from a judgment directing matrimonial property.
The main issue was whether the judge erred in his distribution of assets acquired with the proceeds of a severance package which the appellant received when his employment of twenty-three years was suddenly and unexpectedly terminated.
The couple's marriage had lasted less than four years.
HELD: The QB judgment was upheld regarding the severance package.
The severance package was not a reward for past service; it was for payment in lieu of reasonable notice of termination.
The severance package was based on future earnings, which would have occurred within the duration of the marriage.
The QB judge did however fail to take into consideration that the wife had taken a quantity of furniture and household goods and that, as a result, he failed to give the husband his one-half share of them.
Judgment varied accordingly.","[0, 4, 2, 3, 9, 5, 6, 10, 13, 14, 12, 11, 15, 1]"

The plaintiff was present at the meeting of the Committee of the Whole on April 2, 1992 and the plaintiff in his testimony referred to notes of the events which took place during the meeting.

3)Application by respondents (plaintiffs by counterclaim) for payment out of the monies garnisheed.
HELD: 1)Application allowed.
At the time that the applicants were served with the statement of defence and counterclaim, they were not represented by counsel nor did they know that they had to serve and file a statement of defence to the counterclaim.
However, immediately upon being served with the garnishee summons they contacted solicitors.
The application to set aside the default judgment was made as soon as possible after the judgment came to the attention of the applicants who have explained to the satisfaction of the court their failure to defend the counterclaim.
The applicants have clearly shown that they have a good defence on the merits to the counterclaim.
The applicants did not delay their application to set aside the judgment so that it cannot be argued that delay will cause irreparable injury to the respondents.
2)Application to set aside guarishee summons dismissed.
There has been strict compliance with s.3(2) of the Act.
The affidavits filed by the applicants challenging the affidavit for garnishee summons have no bearing on whether the garnishee summons should be set aside.
It is not the function of a judge to look into the merits of the case on such an application.
3)Application for payment out of monies garnisheed dismissed.
Section 14(1) of The Attachment of Debts Act provides that no order shall be made for payment out of any money paid into court by the garnishee when a garnishee summons issues prior to judgment until the plaintiff has recovered a judgment against the defendant.
Since the judgment has been set aside the application for payment out is premature and is therefore dismissed without prejudice to reapply.","[0, 16, 10, 13, 1, 8, 5, 17, 4, 12, 3]"

The same calculations could have been done by a computer program or by counsel or the trial judge with the assistance of the tables to the Rules of Court.
2)The trial judge properly explained to the jury that the accountant was not testifying as an expert.

4)The Appellant's argument that the trial judge failed to properly direct the jury as to the weight to be given to the accountant's evidence was rejected.

223574A Registry: Halifax Between: Pat Pottie Appellant v.The Nova Scotia Real Estate Commission Respondent Judge: The Honourable Justice Gregory M. Warner.
Heard: June 9, 2005, in Halifax, Nova Scotia Counsel: J. Brian Church, Q.C., counsel for the Appellant.
Alan J. Stern, Q.C., counsel for the Respondent.
By the Court:[1] Pat Pottie, a licensed realtor, appeals the finding of unprofessional conduct made by a discipline sub-committee (“Committee”) of the Nova Scotia Real Estate Commission (“Commission”), and the sanctions imposed, including a two year license suspension and order to pay costs of $9,980.08.
[2] Four grounds of appeal are set out:(a) the decision was quickly made which did not reflect the time needed to consider the totality of the evidence presented.
(b) the decision of the Commission was arbitrary and contrary to the principles of natural justice resulting in a denial of the principles of fairness.
(c) the Commission erred in law by having no juristic basis to apply such a harsh and severe penalty.
(d) The penalty of the board was excessive having regard to this case.
[9] The Commission did not drop the matter and continued the investigation.","Members of the Association of Professional Engineers who were also SIAST employees challenged the statutory provisions and collective bargaining agreement whereby they were compelled to become members of the SGEU.
In Queen's Bench it was held that the statutory provisions which created two bargaining units for institute employees and required certain employees to be union members did not violate s.2(d) of the Charter.

In particular the Director found that the Landlord allowed mouldy conditions in the premises to develop and failed to rectify same, with the result that some of the Tenant’s belongings were ruined.
[2] The Landlord did not attend the hearing before the Director.
It appears that she missed it inadvertently, and she appeals to this Court against the findings.
[3] The Tenant produced considerable evidence to substantiate that the basement in her unit was damp and riddled with mould, with the result that a number of items of furniture, an area rug, various boots and articles of clothing were ruined.
She also produced evidence in the form of medical letters to the effect that her children suffer from asthma and ought not to be exposed to mouldy conditions.
She further testified that her own breathing was affected by the mould, despite never having had breathing problems.

That order effectively permitted the Tenant to convert what had been a year to year lease into a month to month one.
It also denied the Landlord’s request that the tenancy be deemed to have terminated because the Tenant effectively refused to renew for another year.
[3] The Landlord (specifically its president, Mr. Lorimer) and the Tenant are relatively sophisticated parties, and this tenancy concerns a high-end flat in south-end Halifax which is occupied by the Tenant and two other individuals.
[4] The original lease ran from September 1, 2007 to August 31, 2008, and was renewed for one year.
(2) A fixed‑term lease ends on the day specified in the lease and, if a tenant remains in possession with the consent of an owner, the lease is deemed to have renewed itself on a month‑to‑month basis.
(4) Where a tenant makes a written request pursuant to subsection (3), the landlord shall respond within thirty days of receipt thereof, otherwise consent is deemed to be granted.
[5] The Landlord responded within thirty days and refused to consent, giving his reasons why he believed that it was not in his interest to have a month to month tenancy.","The City applied for an interlocutory injunction restraining the Defendant Unions from engaging in unlawful picketing.

The Defendant Unions did not file any materials.
HELD: Application allowed.

[3] Some of this flooring material had been selected by Joseph and his wife when they visited the Wacky’s store with Jollymore.
There was, however, no direct contact between Wacky’s and Joseph or his wife, and the purchasing of all material was left up to Jollymore who dealt with Wacky’s flooring manager.
The goods were invoiced to Maritime and delivered and installed in the Joseph’s home.
[4] Cheques to pay for the construction process and the services of subcontractors were provided by Joseph primarily to Jollymore, but also to others on Jollymore’s instructions.
Other cheques and cash were paid out to various parties and a total amount of approximately $638,600.00 were paid out by Joseph under the direction of Jollymore.
Jollimore and Maritime declared bankruptcy and failed to complete their obligations under the oral contract with the Josephs.

The grounds for appeal as stated in the Notice of Appeal are:(a) jurisdictional error; and(b) error of law[2] The particulars of the error or failure as set out in the appellant’s Notice of Appeal are:1.
The Adjudicator made an error of law and was in excess of jurisdiction in determining that the Small Claims Court had jurisdiction to hear the application of the respondent for a review of rental increase.
2.
The effect of the Adjudicator’s decision is that he is now hearing an application for declaratory relief.
It is respectfully submitted that the Adjudicator of the Small Claims Court sitting on an Appeal of an Order of the Director of Residential Tenancies does not have the jurisdiction to grant Declaratory Relief.
[3] In his brief, counsel for the appellant, Killam Properties Inc., raised three issues:1.
Does the Adjudicator have the jurisdiction to amend the Section 14 application of the Respondent and hear it as a Section 13(1) application?
Does an Adjudicator have the jurisdiction to grant Pure Declaratory Relief?
[6] With regard to affidavit evidence, clearly, the Small Claims Court Act appeal provisions do not provide for the submission of any new evidence.","FIAT An employer sought judicial review of a unanimous decision by an arbitration board ordering the reinstatement of an employee.
The employee had previously been terminated and then reinstated by the mutual agreement of the union and the employer.
The employee was then terminated a second time for a repeat infraction.
The employer took the position that the agreement was a 'last chance' agreement and that the arbitration board was therefore required to uphold the second termination.
The Board ruled that the agreement was not a 'last chance' agreement because the agreement stated on its face that a further infraction would result in 'discipline up to and including dismissal'.
The Board therefore reinstated the employee but imposed a 16 month suspension, without pay.
HELD: 1)On issues involving the interpretation of a collective agreement, an arbitration board's decision can only be overturned if it is patently unreasonable.
If there is any evidence on the basis of which the board could have found as it did then its decision should not be interfered with, even if the Court would have come to a different conclusion on the same evidence. 2)Decisions involving the interpretation of a statute or the common law, however, are not within an arbitrator's core area of expertise and should therefore be reviewed with reference to the standard of correctness.
3)In this case, the 'mutual agreement' was subsidiary to the collective agreement and its interpretation was therefore within the core area of the arbitrators' expertise.
The standard to be applied to the board's interpretation of the mutual agreement was therefore one of patent unreasonableness.
4)The employer's evidence that it had verbally advised the employee that he would be fired for any repeat infraction was rightly rejected as contravening the parol evidence rule.
The board's interpretation of the mutual agreement was therefore not patently unreasonable and in fact was correct.
5)The board was also entitled to reject the employer's argument based upon the doctrine of 'culminating incident' and it did not act unreasonably in so doing.","[5, 3, 0, 2, 6, 7, 4, 10, 12, 15]"

PROCEEDINGS: Three separate actions were commenced following the death of Rajbir Singh Sandhu on August 31, 1997.

48976.
No.
151158C.
No.
151846C.
Following certain pre-trial communications among counsel and discovery examinations of important witnesses, it became obvious that there were circumstances surrounding Professor Sandhu’s wills and death which might reasonably be considered suspicious.
Several procedural agreements were reached.
These matters cannot be combined into one action or proceeding.
It was further agreed that the evidence placed before me at the hearing might be applied to all three proceedings.
Initially it was thought that separate decisions would be filed in the three actions.
To put these distinct claims in context one must briefly recall the extraordinary life of the late Rajbir Singh Sandhu.
Truth is often much more compelling than fiction.
He studied law.
His parents were devout Sikhs.
Their son Gurpreet was born on December 4, 1961.
While in America he met Marcelle Cendres.
They began a relationship.
Inderjeet and Rajbir Sandhu separated in 1967.
He named Marcelle as his wife.
He made no reference to Inderjeet or Gurpreet.
Through efforts initiated by Inderjeet, Gurpreet re-established communication with his father.","The accuseds were charged under ss.300 and 301 of the Code with (i)committing and (ii)publishing a defamatory libel against a police officer.
They filed a plea of justification as permitted under s.611(1) of the Code.
The Crown denied the truth of the plea pursuant to s.611(4) and the matter proceeded to trial.
At the opening of their trial the accuseds applied for an order declaring ss.300 and 301 of the Criminal Code to be of no force and effect on the basis that they constituted an unreasonable limitation on their rights and freedoms guaranteed under ss.2, 7 and 11 of the Charter.
The Crown admitted that ss.300 and 301 limited an individual's right to freedom of expression as provided by s.2 of the Charter but argued that this infringement was justified under s.1 of the Charter.
HELD: Application allowed in part.
 1)The onus of justifying the limitation of a right or freedom is on the party seeking to uphold the limitation and the standard of proof is by a preponderance of probability. 2)The standards against which a limit on a right or freedom guaranteed by the Charter can be shown to be reasonable and demonstrably justified are those underlying values and principles essential to a free and democratic society.
While the right of free speech is important in our society, it is not unrestricted. 3)In order to justify an infringement of this right, it must be shown that: (i)the impugned legislative provision has an objective of pressing and substantial concern and (ii)there is a proportionality to the legislation in that: (a)the measures must be fair and not arbitrary, carefully designed to achieve the objective in question and rationally connected to the objective; (b)the means should impair freedom of expression as little as possible; (c)there must be a proportionality between the effects of the limiting legislation and the objective.
S.300 of the Code meets these tests, and is therefore a reasonable limit on free speech and is valid. 4)Ss.611 and 612 of the Code, which permit a plea of justification do not create a reverse onus on the accused.
They are procedural and merely serve to put the Crown on notice as to the accused's defence.
The Crown must still prove that the alleged defamatory libel is knowingly false beyond a reasonable doubt. 5)S.301 of the Code makes it an offence to publish a defamatory libel whether or not the accused believes it to be true.
S.301 is therefore not a reasonable limit and is invalid.

The actus reus of the offence was clearly proved.

Having found the legislation under which the accused was charged to be unconstitutional, an acquittal was entered.
The Crown appeals from that finding.
The trial judge also indicated that, had he found the legislation to be constitutional, he would have entered a conviction because he rejected the defence of due diligence advanced by the accused.","The accused appealed her conviction on a charge of impaired driving.

Findings of fact are not to be reversed on appeal unless it can be established that the trial judge has made some palpable and overriding error which affected her assessment of the facts. 2)The Court's task is not to retry the case or substitute its own decision.

Original judgment has been corrected, with text of erratum appended.
When they divorced, its terms were incorporated in the corollary relief judgement.
When he died, the former husband had not changed his will which left the residue to his former wife.
The Chambers judge held that the separation agreement did not revoke the will and accordingly, she was entitled to the testamentary gift.
The mother of the deceased appeals.
Issue: Whether, before a testator’s death, a person can contractually obligate himself or herself to renounce a testamentary gift.
Result: Appeal dismissed.
The Chambers judge’s reasoning was flawed.
However, the appellant failed to produce any legal authority that a contractual promise to renounce, given for consideration before the death of a former spouse, binds a person to renounce a testamentary gift after his death.
Even if the former spouse were so bound, it does not appear that there is any privity of contract which would allow the appellant here, who was not a party to the separation agreement, to enforce the separation agreement.

; Saunders and Fichaud, JJ.A.","Guardian was the general liability insurer for Kellogg.
Royal was the primary insurer as holder of Kellogg's blanket fleet coverage.
Kellogg's employee was involved in a motor vehicle accident while on company business but was driving his wife's vehicle at the time of the accident.
Royal denied coverage and refused to defend on the basis of an exclusionary provision regarding the use of substitute automobiles.
It was held at trial that Royal was not obligated to participate.
HELD: 1)The case law reveals some inconsistencies with respect to the relationship between the duty to defend and the coverage provided by the policy.
Where the policy clearly does not provide coverage, the insurer had no duty to defend.
Where a policy only provides coverage for some allegations the insurer is only obligated to defend those allegations which may trigger the obligation to indemnify.
When a policy is ambiguous some courts have adopted Thames and have stated the mere possibility that the policy may provide coverage is sufficient to oblige the insurer to defend. 2)Section 209 provides no guidelines as to the scope of the inquiry the judge may engage in.
The chamber judge did not define the scope of his inquiry and stated that the standard suggestion that Guardian must raise an arguable point was 'off target'.
To determine whether an insurer has the obligation to defend a chamber judge must examine the coverage provided by the policy.
The judge made no finding of ambiguity in the exclusionary provision.
He simply determined the Honda was not covered by the Royal policy and did not decide the issue of indemnity. 3)The affidavit evidence indicated that the parties lived in the same premises thus that argument was without merit.
CONCURRING JUDGMENT: The appeal was dismissed for different reasons.
 1)There has been an acceptance of the general concept that the duty to defend is broader than the duty to indemnify.
To order an insurer to defend a chamber judge need be less sure the policy provides coverage than would be the case for an actual determination of liability under the policy. 2)There was a factual element which could not be determined on this application such as whether a partially deflated tire constitutes a breakdown within the meaning of the policy and whether the automobile the employee was driving was owned by someone living in the same dwelling. 3)The question centered around the words used in clause 5 of the policy and who it referred to.
There were inconsistencies in terminology.
The policy should not be interpreted as though the restriction it contains on what automobile can be used as a temporary substitute should be ignored.","[1, 3, 8, 9, 12, 13, 4, 7, 14, 17, 11, 6, 5, 0, 10]"

The appeal turned on whether the debt was accruing due or whether it was a conditional debt because it could be assigned.
HELD: The appeal was allowed.
The GIC was attachable pursuant to s5(1) of the Attachment of Debts Act.
 1)The main point was whether the debt was not attachable because it was not accruing due when the garnishee summons was served in that it did not bind the debt. 2)The leading authority, Webb v. Stenton, concluded that existing debts payable in the future are attachable.
3)The garnishability of the debt owing under a promissory note is not prevented because the debt is conditional by reason of the possibility of assignment.
 4)Saskatchewan courts have followed Bel-Fran holding that a term deposit is attachable.
The only exception is Tradewinds which overlooked the aspect of s5(1) which permits attaching of debts which are accruing due.
Tradewinds is contrary to Spiritwood and misapplies the law summarized in Barsi v. Farcas.
The historic review demonstrated that there have been gradual changes in the law of garnishment.
Based on the cases reviewed the assignability of a GIC is not the type of condition which has been held to affect the determination that a debt is accruing due.
5)Because of the early payment to the estate there were no intervening claims and no priority issue arose.
It would be inappropriate to deny judgment in the circumstances.
DISSENT:
The appeal would be dismissed for reasons other than those reached by the chambers judge. 1)The statement that the creditor cannot be in a better position than the debtor to demand payment under the GIC is probably correct but was not a factor as the Bank was not seeking payment before its maturity date.
The Bank's position was the debt had been garnisheed and payment should have been made to the Bank on maturity. 2)The chamber judge's comment that the Bank could have seized the GIC under execution and then had it sold by the sheriff was obiter. 3)The debt was a present debt due on its maturity date and therefore qualified as one that was accruing due. 4)Whether it was conditional depended upon whether the opportunity of assignment constitutes a conditional obligation.
There is no significant difference between a promissory note and a GIC as they both contain a promise to pay a sum certain at a designated date. 5)Some jurisdictions specifically provide that a debt payable within six years of the service of the garnishee is garnishable.","[1, 12, 9, 4, 5, 6, 2, 14, 13, 3, 8, 19]"

INTRODUCTION:[1] This appeal turns on one main question: in deciding the worker’s gradual onset stress claim under the Government Employees Compensation Act, R.S.C.
1985, c. G-5 (GECA), was the Workers’ Compensation Appeals Tribunal (WCAT) wrong to assess the nature of the workplace events and stressors from an objective point of view?
[2] In my view, the answer is no.
WCAT correctly decided that compensable gradual onset stress requires that there have been work-related events or stressors that are unusual and excessive viewed objectively, that is, in comparison to those experienced by an average worker in the same or similar occupation.
[3] I would dismiss the appeal.
II.
WCAT found that this reflects the law which was in place before the Policy came into effect in July of 2005.
At the heart of the appeal is whether WCAT was wrong to take this approach and if not, whether WCAT applied it unreasonably to the worker’s situation.
[6] There is no dispute about the standard by which we should review these questions on appeal.
The question of whether WCAT applied the correct legal test in this case (the first issue) is reviewed for correctness.","This was an appeal from the decision of a chambers judge striking the appellant's Statement of Claim under Rule 25.01 for being outside the limitation period.

Nova Scotia (Workers’ Compensation Appeals Tribunal), 2009 NSCA 123Date: 20091204 Docket: CA 309638 Registry: Halifax Between:The Workers’ Compensation Board of Nova Scotia Appellant v.Workers’ Compensation Appeals Tribunal, Attorney General of Nova Scotia and Martin Kaye Respondents Judge: The Honourable Justice OlandAppeal Heard: November 25, 2009Subject: Workers’ Compensation Act, s. 228 - Chronic Pain Regulations, s. 9Summary: The Workers’ Compensation Board appealed the effective date of the chronic pain benefits awarded to a worker.
That date has been found on the evidence to be earlier than November 26, 1992 which is set out in s. 228, one of the Act’s transitional provisions which deals with injuries between March 23, 1990 and February 1, 1996 (the “window period”).
Issue: Does s. 228 of the Act limit the retroactive payment of chronic pain benefits stemming from injury within the window period?
Result: Appeal dismissed.
Section 228 has no application to payment of chronic pain benefits for injuries during the window period.
Nor is entitlement under s. 9 of the Regulations restricted to an effective date of November 26, 1992.
This information sheet does not form part of the court’s judgment.","The plaintiff was terminated as a sales agent after being employed by the defendant for 26 years.
As part of the termination package he received 14 months salary continuation.
The plaintiff claimed that he had not received 'reasonable notice' and sought damages.
He also claimed that he was owed arrears of salary at the time of his dismissal.
The defendant argued that the plaintiff had failed to mitigate his damages.
Dismissing the action, that the appropriate period of notice was in the range of 14 to 15 months.
Since the calculation of a 'reasonable period of notice' is not an exact exercise, either period could have been justified.
Thus, it could not be said that the 14 month period given by the defendant was unreasonable.
Furthermore, the plaintiff was not owed any arrears.
Finally, in view of a non-competition clause in the contract of employment, it was not unreasonable for the plaintiff not to have pursued employment with other insurance companies any more than he had.","[2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 1, 0]"

:The appellant was convicted after trial in the County Court Judge's Criminal Court for District Number Two on a bill of indictment alleging that he sexually assaulted his stepdaughter between July 1, 1987 and August 31, 1989.
The girl was 11 years old when the alleged assaults began.
The complainant said that the sexual activities started out as fondling and eventually to full sexual intercourse.
The complainant also testified that the appellant had intercourse with her at a cottage.
The complainant's mother, sister, brother and the latter's girlfriend flatly contradicted the complainant as to the time she says the acts took place.","The Department of Social Services requested a permanent custody order for a four and one-half year child pursuant to s37(2) of the Child and Family Services Act.

HELD: The child was placed in the custody of the Minister until the age of 18 years.
It was strongly recommended that she remain in the foster parents' home where she had been for three years.
The natural parents were to have reasonable access.
1)The child was in need of protection.
The parents were unable to provide for all her needs even with the considerable assistance from the Department.
She was exposed to severe domestic disharmony which could have resulted in emotional harm.
The natural parents' ability to provide for her needs had not improved significantly.
The child's special needs resulting from attention deficit disorder required enormous amounts of care and attention on a daily basis.
2)It was in the child's best interests to remain where she was and to continue to have contact with her natural parents.","[0, 1, 2, 5, 6, 3, 9, 11, 7, 10, 15, 13, 17, 12, 18]"

:The appellant appeals from his conviction following a trial in the Supreme Court before a jury on a charge that he:""did assault Richard MacKay, a Peace Officer, to wit: a Police Constable for the Town of Bridgewater, engaged in the execution of his duties contrary to Section 270(2)(a) of the Criminal Code of Canada.""
In the early morning hours of October 24, 1989, Constable MacKay of the Bridgewater Town Police and two other officers responded to a call on LaHave Street in connection with a disturbance.
On arrival at their destination they found evidence of a disturbance, and the occupants of the residence were very upset.
Constable MacKay saw the appellant there and thought he recognized him as a person who was wanted by the police.
He testified that he knew that there were outstanding warrants for the appellant's arrest.
When Constable MacKay asked the appellant his name, the appellant gave a fictitious one.
The officers then responded to another call from next door and following investigation there, Constable MacKay became certain that the appellant was a person who was sought by the police.","FIAT. The plaintiffs sought an order preserving and detaining certain proceeds from oil production properties which were being held by an escrow agent pursuant to an order of the bankruptcy court in Alberta and a further order preserving and detaining all future proceeds from those properties.
The applicants claimed such orders were necessary to protect their claims under the approximately 408 builders' liens filed against those oil properties.
The contents of the statements of claim in each of the five actions were identical.
HELD: The application was dismissed.
The escrow agent was ordered to remit to Herc the lien property revenues with any interest earned less the agent's appropriate costs.
With the exception of SEM the parties appearing through counsel were awarded their costs against the applicants. 1)The tests set out in Bean on Injunctions for granting a mandatory injunction were summarized in Cupar School Division.
The tests really state in different forms the generally recognized test for prima facie case, irreparable harm and balance of convenience but with more stringent requirements. 2)Only one lien holder filed an affidavit, no invoices or other information were filed substantiating the amount claimed in any of the liens.
The word 'or' used in one of the liens indicated that the person subject to the lien did not know whether the water or oil was transported.
Whatever prima facie case the lien holders might have was weakened.
3)The applicants had not established a very strong probability that grave danger will accrue.
The risk to the respondents if the order should be granted was far greater than the risk to the applicants if the order were not granted.
The oil properties would continue to decline without further development or recovery efforts to maintain or increase production.
If a preservation order issued SEM would likely exercise its extensive powers under the Oil and Gas Conservation Act. 4)While s33 of the Builders' Lien Act provides for a lien on the holdback of any trust funds held by the contractor, it does not give the lienholder a charge against any other moneys.
A builder's lien cannot be looked on as 'proof' that the amount claimed is what is actually owing.
The only remedy open to the lienholder is to enforce its claim under Part VIII of the Builders' Lien Act.
The statement of claim said nothing about dates and times.
On the material filed it was impossible to know whether any of the respondents were intervening parties within s49(5)(a).
5)The second and third tests were not met.
The order would guarantee irreparable harm by freezing the capital necessary to hinder the decline in value.
It would be unacceptable to SEM that lien holders should receive the income from the properties without being responsible for the environmental costs. 6)The fourth test required that the defendant know exactly what he has to do.
If the order were to issue it would be difficult to determine the proper amount of lien property revenue that should be paid to an escrow agent.
There was no definition of net revenues in the Plan.
The applicants would have been required pursuant to Rule 390 to pay full compensation before the order was issued.","[0, 2, 1, 3, 7, 5, 6, 12, 11, 13, 9, 8, 10, 14]"

:This is an appeal from a conviction of first degree murder.
We agree with counsel that the trial judge's instruction to the jury contained several serious errors; the most serious being the instruction as to the requisite intent for murder.
The trial judge failed to instruct the jury that nothing short of the accused's subjective foresight of death can found a conviction for murder (R. v. Martineau (1990), 1990 CanLII 80 (SCC), 58 C.C.C.
(3d) 353).
Furthermore, the instruction given could have left the jury with the impression that the appellant could be convicted of murder if it was proven beyond a reasonable doubt that he attacked Smith and was merely careless whether he killed him or not.","A claim for wrongful dismissal.
The position of executive secretary was discontinued for economic reasons.
HELD: The plaintiff was awarded $30,737.93 plus costs plus pre-judgment interest.
1)The plaintiff had taken all reasonable steps to mitigate her losses.
The duty is to take such steps as a reasonable person would take in his own interests to maintain his income and position in his industry, trade or profession.
The former employer has no right to expect that the former employee will accept a lower paying alternative employment with doubtful prospects.
2)Reasonable notice would have been ten months.
She had been erroneously requested to take 19.871 days as annual leave and therefore actually received one months' notice.
Nine months salary at $26,514.00 plus $1,325 for lost pension benefits and $564 for the Canada Pension Plan were awarded.

This is an appeal from the acquittal of the respondent on a charge of assaulting his wife.
The evidence indicates the respondent had come to visit his estranged wife on August 18, 1990.
He complained of being tired and suffering from insomnia.
The respondent left but returned about 4:00 p.m. and at that time was in possession of a quart of whiskey.
He left shortly thereafter taking the whiskey with him.
She testified that the respondent was intoxicated.
She testified that he hit her and butted out a cigarette on her hand.
The behaviour of the accused at the time in question was, as described by Mrs. Saulnier, completely irrational and entirely out of character.","At issue was the determination of the quantum of spousal and child support and division of matrimonial property.
HELD: 1)The respondent's supplementary allowances were taken into consideration in finding a gross salary of $53,000.00 per annum.
Due to an injury he was no longer able to work overtime but was working full-time.
Should a medical discharge become necessary an application to vary can be brought at that time. 2)The petitioner suffered a substantial economic disadvantage.
The frequent moves due to the husband's employment had disrupted the petitioner's employment and university education.
However, the court must also take into consideration the economic advantage enjoyed as a result of the marriage including the pension plan of the spouse.
3)If the petitioner did receive the greater share of the household goods it can be attributed to partial compensation for her economic disadvantage.
Shares in joint names were divided equally.
Other assets were divided equally.
4)Upon the granting of the divorce the petitioner will be disqualified from receiving the pension survivorship benefits.
The fair solution was to use the enhanced value of the 'With Survivorship Benefits' column and the date of adjudication was used as the valuation date.
The combination method of valuation was used in view of the 15 year marriage and given the economic disadvantage suffered by the petitioner.
5)The parties agreed that child support should be set in accordance with the Federal/Provincial/Territorial guidelines based on the respondent's gross yearly income.
$600.00 per month per child was awarded.
 6)The court must seek to promote the economic self-sufficiency of each spouse.
The petitioner's future plans were realistic.
$800 per month until June 1, 2001 was awarded for spousal support.
 7)Costs including one-half of the cost of preparing reports and pension valuations were awarded to the petitioner.","[2, 7, 1, 0, 4, 8, 5, 6, 15, 3, 11, 9, 12, 22, 19]"

DECISION: March 23, 1993RELEASED: July 6, 1993COUNSEL: J. Scott D. GrantKELLY, J.
(Orally)On the night of June 21, 1991, Corporal Matthews of the Dartmouth Police was conducting a plain‑clothes surveillance of a certain building in Dartmouth, Nova Scotia, as directed by his Police Chief who had based the instruction upon complaints that the place was operating as an ""after‑hours"" club.
Surveillance had also been conducted by other persons prior to that time and the results were brought to the attention of Corporal Matthews.
The essence of the observations were that a number of people were entering and leaving the dub at late hours and were believed to be under the influence of alcohol.
At about 11:40 p.m. on June 21, 1991, Corporal Matthews observed the accused Mr. Gerald Chabot and his wife enter these premises.
He advised the court that it was his intention to seek information to be used in an attempt to obtain a search warrant of the suspected after‑hours club for possible Liquor Control Act violations.","A claim for damages to the plaintiff's leased automobile arising out an accident.
The action against the defendant Ruhr had been discontinued.
An SGI adjuster appraised the damage but during the course of repairing the vehicle further damage was found.
A roving adjuster authorized the replacement of the exhaust system but deducted 20% for depreciation.
The plaintiff brought an action for reimbursement of the $503.73 arguing that SGI elected to repair or replace the exhaust system under statutory condition 8(4) of s39 of the Automobile Accident Insurance Act.
SGI took the position that as Crestview was the registered owner of the vehicle the plaintiff was not entitled to bring this action as he was not the insured within the meaning of the Act.
SGI also argued that Crestview authorized the repairs and acknowledged the 20% deduction as registered owner and that if the plaintiff paid the $503.73 he did so under his private lease contract with Crestview.
It also argued that it is entitled to deduct for depreciation in any event.
HELD: The claim against SGI was dismissed with taxed costs.
 1)An election under statutory condition 8(4) amounts to an irrevocable decision to repair regardless of costs of repairs.
Once an election is made the insurer is bound to pay or reinstate.
An insurer by its conduct may be deemed to make an election to reinstate.
The insurer's election to reinstate unilaterally creates a new contract which the insurer may not unilaterally revoke.
On the facts the insurer neither expressly nor by its conduct elected to reinstate.
The roving appraiser provided an appraisal to Crestview which included the depreciation deduction.
Crestview repaired the vehicle without advising the plaintiff. 2)The concept of waiver in insurance law encompasses an election to pay or to reinstate.
Estoppel was not applicable.
Two provisions of the Saskatchewan Act provide that SGI in certain situations is not deemed to have waived provisions of the Act.
The roving appraiser reassessed the claim and included the newly found damages.
These acts related to the appraisal of the claim and could not constitute a waiver of statutory condition 8(1).
They did not constitute an election under statutory condition 8(4).
Crestview, not SGI, took the steps to repair the vehicle.
As the plaintiff did not receive a written waiver of statutory condition 8(1) pursuant to s77 the insurer could not be deemed to have waived its option to enforce statutory condition 8(1).
 3)The exhaust system was three years old and had 46,000 km of wear.
A 20% deduction for depreciation was appropriate and therefore allowed.
 4)It was not necessary to determine whether the plaintiff was the 'insured' as defined by the Act.","[4, 2, 0, 1, 5, 9, 6, 3]"

:The respondents were charged with possession for the purposes of trafficking and cultivation of marijuana contrary to Sections 4(2) and 6(2) of the Narcotic Control Act.
At the commencement of their trial in Supreme Court, after the jury selection, a voir dire was held to determine the admissibility of evidence obtained by the police as a result of a seizure of marijuana plants.
The respondents alleged that their Charter rights under s. 8, to be secure from unreasonable search and seizure, had been violated.
Constable Furey, of the R.C.M.P.
Bridgewater detachment, was the only witness to testify on the voir dire.
No evidence relevant to this case was seized from the house.
He stated:“Therefore, there was no lawful entry and the warrant obtained after the three entries but before the search of the residence was invalid.
The warrantless search was unreasonable.
Clearly, s. 8 of the Charter was infringed.""
In concluding that the evidence was not admissible, he said:“.
The courts cannot condone a practice of deliberate, unlawful conduct which may intrude on individual privacy.""","The plaintiff, a specialty seed marketing company, claimed damages from the defendant for an alleged breach of contract.
Johnson Seeds entered contracts with growers prior to the seeding and harvesting to secure product for resale.
After extended negotiations the defendant eventually signed and mailed the standard form contract but never received an executed copy.
The price of the canary seed escalated substantially during 1993.
The defendant thought that as he did not have a copy of the contract signed by the plaintiff it was not a valid contract and sold the seed to a third party for more than double the contract price.
HELD: Johnson Seeds was awarded judgment for $50,850.05 and pre-judgment interest together with costs of the action.
1)There was a valid contract between the parties.
Damages were assessed as of January 1994 when Johnson Seeds knew that the defendant was in breach of the contract.
2)The issue was whether communication by delivery of the fully executed contract was necessary to complete the contract.
The parties communicated by fax, mail and telephone.
There was no doubt that the defendant verbally confirmed that a contract did exist.
Discussions prior to May 1993 were pre-contractual negotiations. 3)Johnson Seed knew that it was prepared to pay 10 cents only if delivery occurred after January 1/94.
The formal contract did not expressly set forth these conditions.
Both parties knew these terms were absent when they executed the contract but both considered that they had a legally binding contract in 1993.
 4)Farr took a calculated risk and sold the seed which alleviated his immediate cash-flow problem.
Johnson Seeds waited until the last possible day under the written contract terms to call the contract in an effort to position itself to claim increased damages for breach of contract.","[2, 11, 1, 0, 6, 5, 7, 24, 9, 13, 8, 12, 30, 33, 36, 29, 10, 28]"

;The appellant was charged with operating a motor vehicle while impaired by alcohol or a drug: s. 253(2) of the Code.
On November 4, 1991, Provincial Court Judge John R. Nichols, after trial, reserved his decision and then found him guilty of the offence.
He appealed that conviction.
Summary Conviction Appeal Court Justice Charles E. Haliburton, after hearing argument and receiving briefs, reserved his decision and, on August 23, 1994, dismissed the appeal.
The appellant now seeks leave to appeal and if that is permitted, appeals that latter decision.
He exceeded the required dosage voluntarily and as a result the signs of impairment were noted by the constables on the day in question.","HELD: 1)The officer was to answer any proper questions seeking his opinion on audit issues arising in the context of the Trust Company's records or files.
To be proper the questions need only be broadly relevant to the issues raised in the pleadings in the sense that they are in some way connected to the allegations made.
Hypothetical questions seeking his opinion consequent upon his professional experience could be asked where his and C&amp;L's conduct were in issue.
The officer's expert opinion could not be sought on matters not raised in the pleadings.
2)The disclosure and production of documents was justified under the broad relevance test.
A party is entitled to discovery of a document if it directly or indirectly enables him to advance his own case or destroy that of his adversary or may fairly lead to a form of inquiry which may have either consequence. 3)The 'damage claim documents' had been provided.
There should be a sameness in the manner and isolation of the documents in the discovery process undertaken by each party.
Whether the memoranda of discussions with third parties were privileged or irrelevant was a matter for the trial judge.
4)The issue of compelling a response to undertakings had been resolved.
5)The request for an order for an immediate pre-trial conference was redundant as there was no basis for one until the action was ready for trial.
6)Leave to further amend the statement of claim pursuant to Rule 165 had been granted.","[2, 3, 0, 1, 8, 5, 9, 6, 7, 4, 10, 11, 12, 13, 15]"

(Orally)The plaintiff alleges that in 1988 he purchased aircraft parts from the defendants, such parts being a Piper PA‑11 fuselage.
The defendant is in the business of manufacturing and selling such parts in Lyons, Wisconsin, U.S.A.
The plaintiff constructed the aircraft and first flew it in August, 1991.
The aircraft crashed in August, 1992, and the plaintiff alleges the crash was due to faulty and substandard materials used by the defendant in the manufacture or construction of the PA‑11 package.
He says that the fuselage was not up to the standards promised by the defendant and was ""...not certified as warranted by the Defendants...."" He says only the defendant had full knowledge of the materials used in the construction of the fuselage.
The defendants have applied either to have the service of the Originating Notice and Statement of Claim set aside as this Court has no jurisdiction, or to have the action stayed on the basis of forum non conveniens.
In the application it has described its business as receiving orders by mail order and telephone which are then processed in Wisconsin for either pick up there or delivery to the customer.
It has no presence in Nova Scotia, other than through the possibility of receiving orders, presumably through its catalogues.
According to the defendants the parts used by them are all inspected by various agencies in the United States.","A month following the birth of the plaintiff's only child by caesarian section, she underwent a hysterectomy on an emergency basis.
She believed that the post-partum haemorrhage was caused by retained products of conception and that failure to perform a dilation and curettage procedure resulted in the hysterectomy.
HELD: The plaintiff's claim was dismissed with costs.
1)The plaintiff failed to prove that the defendant was negligent in his treatment of her.
The doctor's treatment and care met the standard of care expected of the average physician and surgeon, specializing in gynaecology and obstetrics.
2)She failed to prove that the cause of the post-partum haemorrhage was retained products of conception or that his failure to perform a D&amp;C resulted in the necessity of a hysterectomy or because of any other negligent act or omission on his part.
The most likely hypothesis was that the post-partum hemorrhage was caused in this case by the necrosis of the cervix.
Given the rarity of this condition and paucity of documented medical knowledge the defendant doctor could not be faulted.
The evidence did not support the suggestion that a D&amp;C would have cured the hemorrhage.
ADDENDUM: 1)The first paragraph was deleted and a new paragraph substituted: Kaban v. Sett in applying Ares v. Venner rejected the view that nurse's notes are only prima facie evidence and, if there is sworn testimony contrary to the notes, the notes cease to be prima facie evidence. 2)A paragraph was added after the quote on page 4:
The Manitoba Court of Appeal, in dismissing the plaintiff's appeal, agreed with the trial judge's determination of the admissibility of the nurse's notes.","[0, 1, 4, 3, 5, 8, 6, 12, 11, 9, 7]"

The petitioner seeks a divorce from the respondent as well as maintenance for herself and the five‑year old daughter of the marriage.
The respondent does not oppose the divorce, nor does he deny his responsibility to provide financial support for his daughter.
He contests the quantum of maintenance for the child as well as the entitlement of maintenance to the wife and, if entitled, the quantum and period of time during which she is entitled to receive maintenance.
The marriage has been proven, and I am satisfied that the marriage relationship has irretrievably broken down and the parties have lived separate and apart for a period in excess of one year.
I would, therefore, grant the divorce on the grounds as alleged in the Petition.
CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE PARTIESThe petitioner is 30 years of age, and the respondent 55 years of age.
The child, Kelly, is 5 years of age.
She resides with the petitioner who has been the principal caregiver to the child since birth.
At present she attends grade primary.
The respondent does not seek custody of the child but asks for reasonable access upon reasonable notice.
The respondent was born in England where he completed grammar school, equivalent to Canadian high school.","The primary issue was whether the youth court has jurisdiction in proceedings which are commenced in youth court where it was not possible to determine whether at the time the alleged offences were committed the accused was a young person or an adult.
The secondary issue was whether a writ of mandamus should issue.
The accused was charged with two indictable offences, sexual assault and incest, as well as acts of gross indecency.
The Crown stayed an identical information previously laid against the accused alleging the same offences occurred when he was an adult.
The accused became an adult in October 1985 and was charged with certain offences which occurred between 1985 and 1989.
The summary conviction appeal court judge found the provincial court judge erred in declining jurisdiction and that because of the uncertainty when the alleged offences occurred, the accused should be tried under the least onerous regime, youth court.
The appeal judge then ordered a writ of mandamus directing the youth court judge to render a decision.
It was common ground that a youth court judge does not have jurisdiction with respect to offences committed while he was an adult.
HELD: The decision of the summary conviction appeal court was set aside and the matter remitted to youth court.
Either party may apply for an order under s16 to decide the proper forum to hear the charges.
 1)Section 16 is the ideal vehicle for the youth court to make a proper determination of the proper jurisdiction to hear the charges.
If the Crown after a complete investigation is unable to particularize the time when the offence(s) occurred and alleges that it (they) occurred over a period of time which included when the accused was a young offender and an adult, the preferable approach is to have the Crown commence the proceedings in youth court because some of the offences occurred while he was a youth.
The Crown should then apply to a youth court judge for a transfer hearing under s16 to determine the proper forum to hear the charges.
 2)There are two ways to determine which of the two courts should assume jurisdiction: view the facts in a manner most favorable to the accused and deem the offence was committed when the accused was a young person; or order a transfer hearing under s16(1) of the Young Offenders Act to determine whether the offences should be heard in youth court or ordinary court. 3)The transfer hearing must proceed in an impartial fashion in accordance with the principles of natural justice and s7 of the Charter. 4)Section 16(2) provides the factors to be taken into account in determining the competing interests of the youth and the public. 5)The position taken in the Ontario Court of Appeal in R.v. A(EA) does not lend itself to universal application.
R. v. A(EA) is distinguishable and should be confined to its particular facts.","[4, 3, 0, 1, 7, 5, 8, 6, 12, 10, 9, 11, 18]"

This application was made before Skipper called evidence.
The basis of the application is that Skipper had failed to make reasonable effort to produce documents and information and to give full discovery relevant to the matters in issue.
Phoenix and Skipper called various witnesses on this application and all parties have participated in the examination and cross‑examination of them.
All parties have made oral submissions, supplemented by written briefs.
The cause of action, according to the pleadings, first arose in 1985.
The action was commenced on June 27, 1986, and the pleadings appear to have closed in 1989.
In view of the anticipated lengthy trial, the matter was assigned to me for case management.
The plaintiff retained the chartered accountants, Doane Raymond, to prepare a report on the alleged loss occasioned to it by the defendants.
A report dated March 31, 1992 has been filed.
During the various pre‑trial meetings it was apparent that the defendants had experienced difficulties in obtaining the report needed.
The reasons for this difficulty were not apparent to me until the eventual application made at the opening of trial.

He alleged that he was wrongly assaulted and as a result he was entitled to compensation for the losses he suffered.
On September 10, 1993, Mr. Glasgow was involved in an angry exchange of words with Mr. Johnson.
He asked Mr. Johnson if he wanted to fight.
No fight ensued.

The actus reus of the act was clearly proved at trial.
The trial judge acquitted as a result of his finding that the legislation was ultra vires the Province.
He reasoned that federal legislation had 'occupied the field' with the Tobacco Act, that the federal legislation cannot stand side by side with the provincial legislation, and that the federal legislation therefore prevails.
The trial judge further commented that, had the Act been constitutional, he would have convicted because he did not accept the accused's defence of due diligence.
The Crown appealed, and the accused cross-appealed.
Allowing the appeal and remitting the matter to Provincial Court for trial,
that the Tobacco Access Act is legislation in relation to matters of health, and therefore within provincial jurisdiction.
It does not conflict with the federal Tobacco Act.
The trial judge therefore erred in finding that the Tobacco Access Act was ultra vires.
The trial judge also erred in law with respect to the defence of due diligence.
The question is not, as the trial judge thought, whether the employee who sold the tobacco was duly diligent, but whether the accused, her employer, exercised all reasonable care by establishing a proper system to prevent the commission of the offence, and by taking all reasonable steps to ensure the effective operation of the system.","[0, 2, 1, 3, 5, 7, 6, 8, 9, 10, 4, 11, 13, 12, 15, 17]"

This is an action for damages for injuries suffered by the plaintiff as a result of a motor vehicle accident which occurred on May 31, 1988.
The plaintiff was stopped on the Cole Harbour Road by a flagman to allow a piece of heavy machinery to back out onto the Cole Harbour Road.
Her motor vehicle was struck from behind by a motor vehicle operated by the defendant.
The only damage to the plaintiff's motor vehicle consisted of a bent bumper, which had to be replaced at a cost of $528.61.
The defendant admitted liability, and the only issue for this court to determine is damages.
At the time of the accident, the plaintiff was pushed forward in her seat and may have hit the steering wheel.
Her seat back was not broken, and the plaintiff acknowledges that the accident was not a violent impact.
It was only later that evening that she began to experience back pains.
He treated her with pain killers and prescribed rest and heat treatments.
The plaintiff was 46 years old at the time of the accident and had been working as a Certified Nursing Assistant (CNA) at the Nova Scotia Hospital for approximately nine years prior to the accident.","The defendant, who was to install sewer and water lines on four lots for the hamlet, was charged with seven violations of the Occupational Health and Safety Act and Regulations.
It had been agreed that the offences were strict liability.
The principle issue was whether the defendant had an obligation imposed by law with respect to the workers and if so whether he discharged it by exercising due diligence in the circumstances.
The essential facts were not in dispute.
HELD: The defendant was found guilty on all offences.
 1)There is a legal duty on an employer under the Act to take steps to supervise and oversee excavations to ensure the usual protocols for safety are met.
This requires at a minimum the presence of an experienced person on site.
Any reasonable person with some knowledge of worksite safety would insist that the walls be properly sloped, that there be at a ladder or other method to get out of the trench and that first aid supplies were readily available.
Supervision is essential particularly when the worker is inexperienced.
The deceased had had no experience in sewer and water trenching.
No inexperienced person should be allowed to work on such a potentially dangerous site without proper training and specific guidance and supervision.
The Law is specific on the requirements to be met for safety of the workers on excavation and sewer and water hookups.
2)The remedial progress report was ruled inadmissible.
There was no formal comment on the issue of admissibility. 3)The Act does not define due diligence but well established case authority defines it as taking reasonable care to avoid causing harm which is prohibited by law. 4)The Act does not apply to a contractor.
The relationship had all the ordinary indicia of an employer/employee relationship.
The defendant controlled the project, tools and materials and bore the risk of loss or profit, had the ultimate responsibility for the worksite, completion of the project and the payment of wages.","[3, 7, 5, 9, 0, 8, 1, 4, 6, 15, 11, 13]"

It is an offence under the Motor Vehicle Act for the passenger not to have been wearing it.
The driver subsequently failed the breathalyzer test.
The IssuesHe was convicted of driving with an illegal blood alcohol level after trial in Provincial Court.
His counsel had argued that his s. 8 right to be free of unreasonable search and seizure had been infringed.
The major concern in the context of the alleged Charter infringements is that the police officer based her conclusions for the breathalyzer demand on observations made after she requested that the respondent accompany her from his own car to the police cruiser.
The respondent argued this was a search contrary to s. 8 of the Charter.
The FactsThe respondent, John Wayne MacLennan, whom Constable Byrne had not known previously, was the driver of the vehicle.
Mr. MacLennan was entitled to remain silent.
Questioning by police which might conscript the detained person against himself is improper at this stage, when the right to counsel under s. 10(b) of the Charter is suspended.","In the first application under the Family Maintenance Act the father sought to reduce child maintenance of $250 per child per month to an amount in accordance with the Federal Child Support Guidelines; cancellation of arrears of $13,273.39; and increased access.
In the second application the mother sought to have the paragraph in the 1994 order restraining the parents from removing the children from the province without the other's written consent or court order struck.
HELD: 1)The mother was advised to apply by notice of motion with appropriate supporting affidavits.
 2)The arrears were $11,838.39 as the father had paid money directly which was not accounted for in the Statement of Arrears.
Since the Guidelines were not in force prior to 1997, they do not automatically apply to a support payable prior to 1997.
The father's income was sufficient for him to pay child support for 1996 and 1997.
Arrears for 1993 to 1995 inclusive were reduced as he was not able to pay according to the order at those times.
Upon payment of $5,000 the balance of arrears accrued prior to December 31/98 would be extinguished.
3)The father was to pay child support of $325 per month for the two children.
Garnishment of his wages by the Maintenance Enforcement Office were to be limited to $175 per month for arrears plus the current maintenance due.
4)The parties agreed the father should have access not less than one full weekend per month upon two weeks prior notice plus when he was available to attend at the city in a manner consistent with the children's best interests and their need to be available for school.","[2, 5, 8, 1, 0, 4, 12, 18, 6, 14, 11, 3, 19, 25, 24, 17]"

BACKGROUNDLloyd Gibbs, on Saturday, May 30, 1992 operated his motor vehicle west on Greenfield Road and stopped at the then stop line at a 'T' intersection with Lower Harmony Road.
His first recollection of observing her was when he says he was completely established on the right side of the road in his own lane.
Cheryl Archibald left her home shortly before the time of the accident.
Her evidence is that immediately after she crested the hill, she found the Gibb's van facing her.
Ms. Archibald states that she took evasive action to try and go around the Gibb's vehicle to her left when she says the Gibb's vehicle moved into its lane.
Both motor vehicle operators were alone and wearing seat belts.
Ms. Archibald suffered a broken ankle necessitating surgery and the insertion of pins, and she has a separate action outstanding in relation to her injuries.
There is agreement that it was a beautiful day and the accident occurred at approximately 9 a.m. with no interference in visibility, a clear, bright, sunny day with no precipitation.

LIABILITY(1) Evidence ‑ Findings(a) Lloyd GibbsMr. Gibbs is a 46 year old married man.
He was apparently rendered unconscious and suffered injuries which I will review in detail when I address the matter of damages.","The primary issue was the appropriate parenting arrangement for the two children.
The 1997 interim order awarded joint custody with the primary residence with the mother and reasonable access to the father including alternating weekends, reasonable telephone access and equal sharing of holidays.
The father initially failed to pay child support as ordered then paid $250 per month rather than the $424.72 ordered.
The parties no longer communicated directly with each other except by e-mail so that there was a record.
HELD: 1)It was in the best interests of the children that their primary residence be with their mother.
She had demonstrated greater flexibility and sensitivity to their needs.
The father was granted access two weekends out of every three and additional time as they may agree upon.
Although both were very good parents the parties had not demonstrated an ability to co-parent effectively as illustrated by their communication problems.
The father's access initially went beyond the minimum required by the interim order.
He failed to make support payments as ordered.
The father was to pay child support of $449.
Pursuant to s.7 of the Federal Child Support Guidelines he was to pay 54% of the net cost of child care expenses incurred as a result of the mother's employment and for health related expenses in excess of $100 of the insurance reimbursement upon production of receipts.
 2)The automobile constituted matrimonial property and was valued at $200. 3)Either could speak to costs.","[1, 0, 3, 18, 7, 14, 6, 10, 15, 24, 4, 33, 12, 17]"

CARVERDECISION: MAY 17, 1995WRITTEN RELEASE OF DECISION: MAY 17, 1995COUNSEL: C. CRAIG HARDING, FOR THE PROSECUTION; DUNCAN BEVERIDGE, FOR THE DEFENCE CARVER, J.: This is an appeal by the appellant, Jack Scott Cook, from a decision of The Honourable Judge Anne E. Crawford wherein she convicted the appellant of the offence of driving a motor vehicle on September 4, 1992 while his ability to operate a motor vehicle was impaired by alcohol.
GROUNDS OF APPEAL:1.
That the Learned Trial Judge erred in law in misapprehension of evidence and in failing to have regard to or direct herself to all of the evidence bearing on the relevant issues;2.
That the Learned Trial Judge erred in law in that she failed to direct herself or misdirected herself in law as to the appropriate burden of proof in a criminal case;3.
That the Learned Trial Judge erred in holding that the Appellant's ability to operate a motor vehicle was impaired by alcohol or a drug within the meaning of s.253(a) of the Criminal Code;4.
Such further and other grounds as may be apparent from the transcript of the evidence and may be allowed by this Honourable Court.","The applicant applies for amendment of the judgment dated March 19, 1999 as it relates to costs.
At the end of trial, the applicant requested the Court to reserve on the matter of costs.
The applicant intended to make a submission for award of solicitor and clients costs.
Evidence was led at trial about insubstantial offers made directly between the parties.
Further evidence now indicates that substantial offers were made through council although not led at trial.
The applicant argues that solicitor and client costs of $70,000 should be awarded because the offer to settle of $250,000 is close to the total judgment award of $230,000 including party and party costs of $20,000.
The respondent takes the position that the estate was willing to pay reasonable maintenance costs and the quantum of maintenance could have been summarily determined without the necessity of extensive discoveries and without a lengthy trial.
The respondent submits the approach of a needs-based assessment was upheld by the judgment and is always the approach always taken on behalf of the estate.
The respondent argues the real question is whether the parties were acting bona fide during their negotiations and the issue should not be determined on the basis of the closeness of the offers.
HELD: Solicitor and Client Costs of $70,000 are not appropriate in this case.
The applicant's conduct was not entirely pure.
The applicant was made aware in a prior judgment that under The Dependants' Relief Act there is nothing to indicate that a person is entitled to part of an estate as a beneficiary but rather that a beneficiary is entitled to maintenance.
In spite of this ruling the applicant continued to claim the whole of the estate and to pursue full disclosure of the financial worth of the estate.
Solicitor and client costs are within the discretion of the court but such discretion is exercise only in rare and exceptional circumstances.
The conduct of the respondent cannot be characterized as reprehensible, scandalous or outrageous.
The respondent's unwillingness to make full financial disclosure did contribute to the increase of costs but is insufficient to merit full solicitor and client costs.
The Court awards fixed costs to the applicant in the amount of $47,000 together with disbursements.","[0, 1, 4, 5, 2, 6, 7, 9, 3]"

Solicitor for the AppellantsMary Ellen Donovan Solicitor for the Respondent GOODFELLOW, J.:1.
BACKGROUNDMr. and Mrs. Tannous own a home at 2 Kelvin Grove in Halifax.
Their backyard abuts the Bedford Highway.
The expropriation resolution was filed at the Registry on September 7, 1993, the effective date of expropriation.
The area expropriated was approximately 10 feet of the 30 foot rear yard for a retaining wall.
A copy of the appraisal report prepared by Ingram and Ingram Appraisals Services Limited is enclosed herewith.""
On March 7, 1994 a notice and statement of claim was filed by the claimant with the Utility and Review Board under the Expropriation Act.
Shortly thereafter certificates of readiness were filed by counsel and the Board set the matter down for hearing on November 14‑18, 1994.
At the taxation, a report prepared by David Miller, Q.C.","The issue was whether it was appropriate for the court to require the accused to commence the trial by calling evidence on a Charter voir dire, where the accused gave notice of a Charter application.
This would differ from the usual procedure, wherein the Crown commences the trial by calling its witnesses in the trial proper, and thereafter the accused applies for leave to apply the Crown evidence to the Charter application, where it is appropriate, in addition to calling other defence evidence on the application.HELD: In R. v. Kutynec, the court made the following determinations: 1) whatever procedures are used should not unnecessarily interfere with the inherent jurisdiction of the trial judge to control the conduct of the trial; 2) instead of creating procedures for Charter applications in provincial court, it is better to leave judges the discretion to determine matters such as sufficiency of notice and the extent of the offer of proof; 3) counsel should give timely notice to the Crown of the Charter issue, and at trial, the accused should be able to state with reasonable particularity the grounds upon which the application is made; 4) objections to admissibility of evidence must be made before or when the evidence is proffered; 5) the onus is on the accused to demonstrate on a balance of probabilities that he or she is entitled to a Charter remedy; 6) the trial judge should insist defence counsel state his or her position on possible Charter issues, either before or at the outset of the trial; 7) failing timely notice, a trial judge is entitled to refuse an application to assert a Charter remedy; 8) fairness may require the accused be given some latitude to explore potential Charter issues which he or she had no opportunity to develop prior to trial; and 9) the trial judge must control the proceedings to ensure this legitimate exploration does not become a fishing expedition.
In R. v. Loveman, the court said the trial judge must ensure fairness and preserve the integrity of the trial process.
This may require a judge to refuse to hear a motion where insufficient notice has been given, even when the motion involves an application to exclude evidence under s. 24 of the Charter.
In R. v. Habhab, the court was asked to consider a procedure which involved entering into voir dire at the start of the trial and the Crown proceeding to lead their evidence at the outset regarding the Charter application and substantive issue.
The court dismissed this proposal and stated that the case law implies it is the accused's obligation to lead the evidence on the voir dire.
The court was not able to justify the proposed procedure.
If the authorities imply there is an obligation on the accused to call evidence first on the Charter voir dire, this can occur by the application of some or all the evidence which is already on the record on the substantive issues.
The admissibility of evidence can be reserved by the court pending judgment on the Charter and any s. 24 remedy.
An advantage of having the Crown evidence on record at the outset is it removes uncertainty as to the nature of the testimony as it relates to the Charter application.
This is preferable to the accused calling the Crown witness at the outset on the voir dire, discovering aspects of the evidence are contrary or unfavourable, and then having to convince the court to grant leave to cross-examine.
It avoids a scenario where the Crown witness evidence is led by the defence on the voir dire, and then the accused must impeach the creditability of this witness in cross-examination as it relates to the proof of the substantive issues.
The court concluded the fairness of the proceedings and public confidence in the administration of justice, were best served by the Crown first leading its evidence on the charge alleged and the accused having leave to request the evidence be applied to the Charter issue, if appropriate.","[4, 0, 1, 8, 14, 3, 9, 16, 5, 2, 17, 6, 24]"

At the time, the plaintiff was also advised he would receive salary continuation and benefits (excluding disability) ""until January 5, 1993, or until you secure alternative employment, whichever first occurs"".
The Allstate agent's compensation agreement, in force at the time of his termination, provided for a monthly compensation based on the ""net written premium on new policies recorded in your account during the previous month"" calculated in accordance with certain percentages for the different lines of insurance as therein stipulated together with renewal compensation calculated by reference to the ""net premium on renewal policies recorded in your account during the two production quarters preceding the particular compensation quarter"" multiplied by the applicable percentages and with the resulting dollar amount totalled and divided by six.
The plaintiff declined to accept the program on the basis the Neighbourhood Office Program required the agent to fund their own expenses and would not, in his opinion and in his circumstances, be of benefit to him.
The decision to terminate the plaintiff was therefore the result of a business plan involving the reorganization and restructuring of its sales agent system by the implementation of the Neighbourhood Office Program throughout Canada.
As such, your current position is no longer available.""
Mr. Madden also testified that direct office agents have no management or supervisory responsibility.","An appeal of a conviction for having the care or control of a motor vehicle after consuming in excess of 80 milligrams of alcohol in 100 millilitres of blood contrary to s.253(b) and s.255(1) of the Criminal Code.
Although the trial judge concluded the appellant rebutted the presumption in s.258(1)(where it is proven that an accused occupies the seat normally occupied by the operator of the vehicle, it is presumed he is in care and control unless he can establish that he did not occupy the seat for the purpose of setting the vehicle in motion), the appellant was found to be in de facto control.
HELD: The appeal was dismissed.
It was clear from the trial judge's acceptance of the evidence of the two paramedics who had noted the car parked in an unusual place and police officer who came along later, that he rejected the theory advanced by the appellant's counsel.
The location of the ignition key was not relevant.
The appellant's memory of the events was far from clear given the level of his intoxication.
The trial judge was entitled to accept and rely on the evidence of the Crown witnesses.","[5, 4, 0, 1, 16, 3, 23, 25, 27, 8]"

This is an appeal by the appellant, Allen Wade Spidell, against a decision of The Honourable Judge Anne E. Crawford dated October 24, 1995 wherein she convicted the appellant of an offence that:""At or near Auburndale, in the County of Lunenburg, Province of Nova Scotia, did unlawfully, without reasonable excuse, refuse to comply with the demand made to him by Constable Gary Jonathan White, a Peace Officer, to provide then or as soon thereafter as is practicable, samples of his blood as in the opinion of a qualified medical practitioner were necessary to enable a proper analysis to be made, in order to determine the concentration, if any, of alcohol in his blood, contrary to Section 254(5) of the Criminal Code of Canada.""
FACTS:On February 13, 1995 at approximately 4:00 p.m. the appellant went to the Emergency Department of the South Shore Regional Hospital for treatment for injuries received in a single motor vehicle accident earlier that day.
Dr. Kydd met the appellant at approximately 4:15 p.m. while he was reclining in one of the observation beds.
At this time through questioning the appellant told Dr. Kydd he had been drinking and that he had been in a motor vehicle accident which had occurred one half to one hour prior to being in the Emergency Department.","HELD: The grandparents were granted access one Saturday every second month from 10:00 a.m. to 4:00 p.m.

Plaintiff was found 60% responsible for injuries and defendant 40% responsible.
Damages were assessed as follows: $8,500.00 for general damages, $5,000.00 as damages for loss of income and $1,000.00 for loss of ability to perform household tasks.
The dolly cart out of view behind the counter was an 'unusual danger' which the defendant knew or ought to have known of and reasonable care was not used to prevent injury.
However, the plaintiff failed to look at the floor as his attention was focused on the door.
He assumed nothing had changed in the area from the time he entered the premises a few minutes previously.
The plaintiff was in commercial premises and should have taken greater care to observe and avoid anything in his path.

This is an appeal from the decision of a chambers judge striking the appellant's Statement of Claim.
The appellant and Max Gordon were equal shareholders in a company known as ""Gorbin"".
In August of 1995 the appellant initiated this action against the respondent Banks.
The appellant's action alleges conversion, breach of fiduciary duty and negligence by the Banks.
1989, c. 258, as amended"".
In a thorough and thoughtful decision the Chambers judge determined, pursuant to Civil Procedure Rule 25.01, that the action was statute barred and struck the Statement of Claim.","SGI paid $47,427, the minimum death benefit pursuant to s.146(3) of the Automobile Accident Insurance Act, to the guardian of the three infant children of the deceased single mother.
The guardian appealed SGI's decision that the children were not entitled to any additional benefits.
She argued that since the money paid was in relation to the youngest child, who in the circumstances took the place of a surviving spouse, the death benefit becomes fixed at $47,427, and the formula used in s.146(1) would be half of the income replacement benefit(the IRB) that the deceased would have been entitled to had she survived the accident.
Accordingly the IRB to be used in s.246(5) should be $94,854.
The sole issue was whether any additional child care benefits were payable under s.146(5) when the deceased was unemployed and had no income at the time of the fatal motor vehicle accident.
HELD: The appeal was dismissed without order as to costs.
Where the deceased victim would not have been entitled to any benefit had she survived the accident, the minimum death benefit is still payable, but that amount does not become a factor in calculating the IRB for the purpose of applying the formula contained in s.146(5).
It is the total amount payable as a death benefit.
The IRB in this case was zero and the amount payable pursuant to the formula in either s.146(1) or s.146(5) is zero.
Where no benefit other than the minimum death benefit of $45,000 (adjusted for inflation) is payable under s.146(3), no further amount is payable under either s.146(5) or s.147(5).","[2, 0, 1, 4, 5, 3, 7, 9, 10, 6, 8, 11, 13, 14, 16, 17]"

:This is an appeal by the Crown from a sentence imposed by a Provincial Court judge for a break, enter and theft charge to which the respondent pled guilty.
The respondent was sentenced to pay a fine of $2,500.00 or 50 days in default, plus a victim fine surcharge of $250.00 and three years probation.
The terms of the probation order included a direction that the respondent pay restitution to the victims in the amount of $300.00, that he not have contact with the victims and that he continue treatment with his psychiatrist.
The respondent used a rock to break the patio doors of his neighbour's house, cutting his hand in the process.","The accused, Cote, applied for remedy pursuant to s.24 of the Charter of Rights stating that he was denied the right to be tried on a fraud charge within a reasonable time.
Twenty-two months passed between the laying of the charge and the trial date.
Cote was not responsible for the delay and actively pursued a speedy trial.
The delay was caused by the Crown's failure to provide timely disclosure.
HELD: The charge was stayed.
In applying the decision of the SCC in R. v. Morin, the court found that 22 months is an unreasonable and exceptional period of delay and is of sufficient length to warrant an inquiry.
This case had no particular complexity above the norm for cases of this kind and did not require this delay.
Cote did not directly or indirectly waive his s.11(b) right to be tried within a reasonable time.
Cote was subject to substantial and sufficient prejudice by the delay.
He suffered damage to his political career, embarrassment from media reports, unemployment, and economic hardship.
The court balanced the individual's right to be tried within a reasonable time with society's interest in having the matter proceed to trial despite delay.
Here the defence was not seeking to delay the trial and use the protective shield of s.11(b)as an offensive weapon.","[0, 1, 2, 3, 6, 5, 7, 8, 10, 4, 9]"

The car was eventually returned to the owner without damage.
Mr. Riley is single and has no children.
His prior record is a conviction for mischief for breaking a window for which he was required to pay a $50 fine plus restitution.
The principal ground of appeal is that the sentencing judge failed to give sufficient weight to the principle of rehabilitation.
BACKGROUNDThe information developed by Correctional Services and placed before the sentencing judge, in the form of a pre-sentence report, discloses that:- Mr. Riley was born on November 24th,1976, and was raised primarily by his paternal grandparents.
He experimented with LSD and cocaine.

In issue was whether a solicitor is bound by an undertaking to protect an expert witness for its professional fees.
The defendant solicitor, who represented several farmers and farming companies in suits brought against Saskatchewan Crop Insurance Corporation on a contingency fee basis, confirmed in writing in 1993 that his office would undertake to protect the plaintiff consultants for their fees and disbursements and to pay interest at a rate of 12% per annum.
The plaintiff was hired to provide technical evidence as to crop losses and damages the farmers claimed as a result of actions of SCIC.
When all of the claims were dismissed at trial, the solicitor rejected the plaintiff's demand for payment arguing he had no obligation to pay as the farmers' actions had not resulted in the recovery of any monies.
The plaintiff sued the solicitor in 1997 for professional fees of $37,604.33.
The plaintiff objected to certain portions of the defendant's affidavit.
HELD: The plaintiff was awarded $37,604.33 plus interest at 12% per annum as provided for in the undertaking, and costs of the action.
 1)The plaintiff commenced its action under the general rules but amended its claim without objection to continue under the Simplified Procedure.
2)Portions of the defendant's affidavit were struck as being hearsay and opinion or related to matters immaterial to the proceeding.
 3)The applicant's admissions at discovery did not confirm the interpretation of the undertaking set out in the statement of defence.
It was obvious the plaintiff's officer recognized the farmers were intending to fund their costs from a settlement or judgment and that disbursements, including the costs of any expert's reports commissioned by them or the defendant, would be paid by his clients regardless of the outcome of the suits.
4)The only conclusion that could be drawn was that defendant guaranteed payment of the applicant's account regardless of the outcome of their mutual client's actions.
A solicitor is presumed to know the cannons of the Law Society including c.XVI, comm.10 of the Code of Professional Conduct with respect to undertakings.
The solicitor's undertaking in 1993 was absolutely clear.
The addition of the word 'protect' put the question beyond doubt.
His inquiry in 1997 made it clear the defendant recognized his responsibility and was hoping for some resolution of the applicant's account.","[0, 1, 5, 2, 4, 12, 11, 10, 22, 23, 9, 24, 13, 20, 8, 3, 27]"

The Commission overturned the decision of the stewards and restored the horse declared to be in first place.
In issue was whether the hearsay opinions of stewards from other jurisdictions were admissible; whether the Commission exceeded its jurisdiction by overturning the steward's decision to disqualify the horse; whether the Commission breached the rules of natural justice by failing to give notice of the hearing to the applicants.
The respondents contended the privative clause in the Act gives the Commission the right to interpret the notice provisions of its empowering statute subject only to judicial review on the patently unreasonable standard.
HELD: The application was allowed and the decision of the Commission was quashed.
The matter was remitted to the Commission to be dealt with according to law after the appropriate notices have been given to the applicants.
1)The opinions were not only inadmissible as hearsay but were irrelevant to the present proceedings.
 2)The law is well established that the Court in certiorari proceedings is restricted to determining whether or not the inferior statutory tribunal acted within its jurisdiction or there is an error on the face of the record.
The evidence adduced at a hearing is not part of the record.
 3)The provisions in both the rules of the Saskatchewan Liquor and Gaming Authority for the conduct of horse racing and the Alcohol and Gaming Regulation Act clearly entitle the Commission to overturn a decision of the stewards based on the Commission's own assessment of the evidence.
The stewards were not vested with the sole authority to determine whether there was interference at the gate. 4)Knight v. Indian Head School Division set out that the existence of a general duty to act fairly on the part of a public authority depends on three factors: the nature of the decision, the relationship between the body and the individual, and the effect of the decision on the individual.
5)A miscarriage of justice occurred because the Commission did not give adequate or any notice to the applicants and failed to give them an opportunity to make submissions.
The decision of the Commission to refuse to give the applicants notice of the hearing was patently unreasonable.

The FactsThe respondent Colleen Killorn, then Colleen Clark, was hired November 9, 1989, as account manager with a sales territory consisting of the four Atlantic provinces.
Her conditions of employment were set out in a sales compensation plan which was automatically renewable each March 31st if not renegotiated at the instance of either party as of that date.
The sales compensation plan had not been changed prior to March 31, 1993.
That proposal was known both to the company and to Ms. Killorn through her previous employment.
It was not specifically referred to in her employment contract.
Both Ms. Killorn and the company learned in February, 1993, that the P.E.I.
This was confirmed in March, 1993.

She rejected the compensation offer and brought action for wrongful dismissal.
Ms. Killorn testified.","The accused was charged with sexual assault under s.271 of the Criminal Code.
Although the DNA evidence established he had sexual intercourse with the complainant, neither had any memory of it due to their self-induced states of intoxication.
Defences raised were consent, an honest but mistaken belief that she gave her consent, and extreme drunkenness such that he was so intoxicated that he was not in a conscious state and was incapable of forming any intent to have sexual intercourse without consent.
HELD: The accused was found guilty.
 1)Although the defence of 'extreme intoxication' is successful in the rarest of cases, the accused established the Daviault 'extreme intoxication' on a balance of probabilities.
He would have been acquitted had it not been for s.33.1 which does away with this defence in sexual assault cases.
 2)The court was satisfied on a balance of probabilities that his extreme level of self-induced intoxication rendered him incapable of making a conscious decision to have sexual intercourse with the complainant with or without her consent.
The court was satisfied that the complainant had not done anything to suggest that she would consent.
The accused was incapable of considering the issue of consent and accordingly did not have a mistaken belief or reasonable grounds for such a belief.
It was clear from the testimony of an 11 year old that the intercourse took place long after the complainant passed out.
She was incapable of giving consent after that time.
Her assertion of lack of consent was inherently unreliable due to her lack of any memory of events that occurred before, during and after the alleged assault and would have been more in the nature of an assumption than a fact, but was found to be consistent with all the other evidence.
It was not relevant that she may have withdrawn consent. 3)There was no evidence to give his second defence (that he honestly believed he had her consent) an air of reality.
His assertion that she must have consented or he would not have done it was speculative assumption, not evidence. 4)Section 33.1 provides that the act of becoming voluntarily intoxicated to the extent of being incapable of controlling one's behaviour constitutes criminal culpability sufficient to found criminal liability for offences committed against the bodily integrity of others.
The public outcry and Parliamentary response to Daviault strongly indicate that s.33.1 is not only consistent with the objectives of the Charter but is justifiable and essential in a free and democratic society.
Of four recent cases that held Criminal Code s.33.1 violates the Charter, two held it was saved by s.1 while two held it was not saved by s.1 of the Charter. 5)Section 33.1(1) provides the lack of general intent or voluntariness is not a defence to an assault charge described in ss.(3)if it resulted from self-induced intoxication or the accused departed markedly from the standard of reasonable care generally recognized in Canadian society.
The three sub-conditions described in ss.(2) concerning marked departure constitute criminal culpability similar to recklessness.
Criminal culpability is not dependent on wilful intention to cause harm but on the wilful intention to engage in conduct that incurs the risk of harm without caring whether or not harm ensues. 6)The strong dissent in Daviault indicated those who render themselves incapable of knowing what they are doing through voluntary consumption of alcohol or drugs possess a sufficiently blameworthy state of mind that their imprisonment does not offend the principle of fundamental justice which prohibits the imprisonment of the innocent.
The court has broad discretion to differentiate in sentences imposed for offences that were deliberately committed and those that were committed involuntarily because of self-induced intoxication.","[2, 25, 6, 18, 0, 7, 5, 1, 8, 21, 19, 27, 26, 67, 15, 33, 10, 13, 38, 56, 17]"

:This is an application for leave and, if granted, an appeal from a sentence of 12 months incarceration imposed by Gruchy, J. in Supreme Court.
The appellant pled guilty to a charge of fraud exceeding $5,000 contrary to s. 380(1)(a) of the Criminal Code.
The appellant had engaged in a carefully planned scheme which enabled her to defraud her employer of more than $144,000.
Following detection, she immediately accepted responsibility for her actions, cooperated with the authorities and pled guilty at the earliest opportunity.
No explanation, other than one consistent with greed and envy, was ever given for the commission of the offence.
At the appellant's sentencing it was urged upon Gruchy, J. that he should impose a conditional sentence.","The Court of Appeal was required to determine the limits of its authority to change the application of the Rule against Perpetuities, an established common law principle, to a particular type of oil and gas lease.
In 1950 Taylor entered a 'top' (head) lease for mineral rights with Freeholders Oil, effective upon the expiry of Imperial's interest in 1959.
The new owner of the land recognized the assignment of the 1961 top lease sold to Tarragon in 1993.
After reaching an agreement in 1993 in principle for a 'farmout' arrangement whereby Maxx agreed to drill the lands for Tarragon, Maxx concluded the top lease offended the Rule against Perpetuities and entered its own lease with the landowner.
The trial judge held the 1950 Freeholders lease was void because it contravened the Rule against Perpetuities; although top leases do not offend the policy behind the rule, any modification of the rule is best left to the legislature; there was a breach of confidence.
HELD: The appeal was allowed with costs on double column V.
The action for a declaration that the top lease is void was dismissed with costs in Queen's Bench.
1)The top lease in question was not void as it did not offend the object and purpose of the Rule.
The reasoning and approach of the Supreme Court of Canada in Salituro, Tolofson and Morguard was persuasive.
The decision of the House of Lords in Arthur J S Hall demonstrates the need to re-examine archaic rules of common law which cannot be justified in modern society.
The genius of the common law lies in its adaptiveness to changing times.
Its basic principles are not meant to become rigid formulae.
Common law rules may be tweaked to do justice between the parties when a rigid and mechanistic application of the rule would run counter to the object and purpose of the rule.
Since the socio-economic and political conditions which gave rise to the creation of the Rule no longer exist, it was open to the Court to consider the application of the rule in the context of a commercial instrument such as the top lease in question.
 2)Although top leases have been attacked on other grounds, this was the first case before the Saskatchewan Courts in which the Rule against Perpetuities has been advanced to void such a lease.
The historical background and object and purpose of the rule were reviewed.
The general purpose is to prevent the tying up of property to the detriment of society in general.
The common law rule against perpetuities prevails over intention because it is not a rule of construction, but a rule of property.
A mere possibility, or even a probability that the estate or interest may vest within the time is not enough.
The 'wait and see' doctrine has been adopted by statute in some jurisdictions.DISSENT: The Court should not modify the Rule in the face of the significance of such a modification, the efforts of the legislature to legislate and the inability to deal with such issues as the retrospective operation of such a decision.
The Rule against Perpetuities applies to this top lease.
As there is no life in being in this case, the interest must vest within 21 years of its creation which would have been 1971.
The Rule is not concerned with the duration of an interest but only that an interest may vest at a remote time in the future.
The rule invalidates interests in land that vest too remotely.","[0, 2, 3, 1, 4, 5, 6, 8, 7, 10]"

At about 1:30 a.m. he left alone and began walking home.
He was first interviewed by the triage clerk, Jeffrey Newton, who took the initial history and whose notes are in Exhibit 2, Tab 6 at page 2.
These notes indicate the presenting complaint as a puncture/tear wound received while climbing an iron fence.
No mention is made of the fact that the plaintiff was impaled on the fence for half an hour and I am satisfied that the plaintiff did not mention this fact.
Before continuing, I must indicate that the triage clerk's notes indicate an extremely low temperature of 33.6 and a low blood pressure of 98/60.
Nobody who subsequently dealt with the plaintiff seemed concerned, explaining that the digital tympatic thermometer used was notoriously inaccurate and that the plaintiff's presence and appearance was totally inconsistent with those readings.
There is no evidence whatsoever to suggest that the plaintiff was in shock.
Although these readings were referred to extensively in the trial, I am satisfied that they have no bearing on the real matters of concern here.","The medical doctor alleged the other medical doctors owed a fiduciary duty to act in good faith with respect to their agreement to perform on-call services for the District Health Board.
Under the voluntary arrangement doctors who chose not to enter the arrangement remained on-call to look after their own patients and to respond to emergencies.
It worked well until Hanna established another clinic and began dividing his time between Regina and the Moosomin clinic.
HELD: The actions against the doctors and health district were dismissed with taxed costs.
 1)Hanna's exclusion from the roster was authored by his own conduct.
When he was habitually late on his weekend on-call duties and sometimes failed to show at all, the remaining doctors set up a new on-call roster which did not include him.
Such action was necessary under the bylaws governing the hospital and to provide good patient care to the hospital.
He was not only remiss in performing his on-call duties but there were serious questions about his professional competence.
He would admit a patient and fail to attend upon him or her for several days.
Or he would fail to diagnose an obvious condition.
His reasons for his failure to attend a meeting convened by the hospital administrator to resolve the problems was unacceptable. 2)There was no evidence of a legally binding contract between the doctors.
The on-call arrangement was voluntary.
There was no expressed intention that it be legally enforceable. 3)The common characteristics defining a fiduciary relationship were discussed in Baskerville v. Thurgood.
There was no fiduciary with power over anyone and therefore no fiduciary relationship with respect to the doctors.
 4)The relationship between the hospital and its doctors having privileges in the hospital is one that is defined by the Hospital Standards Act and Regulations and bylaws of the Health District.
Consideration was also given to the relationship with the College of Physicians and Surgeons.
A hospital is never, on the facts, in the position of a fiduciary towards its doctors.
There was no basis in law or fact supporting the existence of a fiduciary relationship between Hanna and the Health District.","[3, 0, 13, 18, 14, 12, 15, 16, 5, 19]"

COUNSEL: Peter Rogers, Esq., Counsel for the plaintiff.

Hall, J.
This is an action for damages for wrongful dismissal where the plaintiff contends that she was constructively dismissed without notice by her employer, the defendant.
The Issues are the following:1.
Was the plaintiff constructively dismissed as a result of changes unilaterally made by the defendant in the terms of her employment?
2.
If there was a constructive dismissal, at what point in time did the plaintiff have notice of the changes which constituted the constructive dismissal?
If the plaintiff was wrongfully dismissed, what is the appropriate period of notice that she is entitled to?
Should the fact that during her period of employment with the defendant, the plaintiff was absent from her employment for ten months on so-called maternity leave be taken into account to reduce the notice period she would otherwise be entitled to?
The plaintiff is now thirty-three years of age, married and the mother of two young children.","FIAT. The applicant applied for an order severing the issues from those raised by the cross-claim and third party proceedings so that his claim may proceed to trial.
The Attorney General opposed severance on the ground the Government of Canada would be prejudiced in its claim for apportionment of the amount of any judgment as between the Government of Canada and the Oblates.
HELD: It was in the best interests of justice that the order of severance be granted so the issue may proceed to an early trial.
The issues of cross-claim and third party proceedings will take a very lengthy period of time.
Hundreds of other claimants who have been asked by the management pre-trial judge to regard the plaintiff's action as a test case were awaiting a judgment.","[2, 3, 4, 0, 5, 7, 1, 9, 11, 13, 15, 6, 10, 8, 12, 20, 17]"

Michael MacDonald at Halifax, Nova ScotiaOral Decision: August 28th, 1997Written Release of Decision: December 3, 1997Counsel: Bernadette Macdonald for the CrownChristopher Manning for the Defence At the outset, I want to thank both counsel for their very thorough and helpful submissions.
The Accused has plead guilty to five theft related charges.
The total amount of money involved for all five counts exceeds $64,000.
He is 43 years of age, and a former Chief of Police for the Town of Kentville.
He used his position of authority as police chief to commit these crimes.
The principles of sentencing that have developed over the years in this Country have recently been codified.
They are set out in s. 718 of the Criminal Code of Canada.
The relevant subsections are:718.
Section 718.1 provides:A sentence must be proportionate to the gravity of the offence and the degree of responsibility of the offender.
The Nature of the Crimes:The Accused, as stated, has plead guilty to five counts involving theft related offences.
Included within these counts is a litany of some twenty separate offences all of which are too ­numerous to review in detail today.","A fifteen year old died in a motor vehicle accident.

1985, c. B-3 (the BIA).
Only two of the remaining sixteen creditors opposed the proposal.
Acceptance required votes representing a majority in number and two-thirds in value of the class of unsecured creditors present in person or by proxy.
Thus 41% of creditors representing 59% of the claims voted pro, and 59% of the creditors with 40.5% of the claims voted con.
The proposal was defeated, subject to the resolution of the objections before the court today.
On further appeal to this court the grounds are whether Justice Stewart erred in:1.
Failing to reverse the Registrar's finding that 18 creditors of LaserWorks assigned their rights to the appellant;2.
Sustaining the Registrar's finding that Datarite engaged in an improper purpose in acquiring and voting the claims of the 18 creditors;3.
Sustaining the Registrar's finding that the Appellant's purpose in acquiring and voting the claims was relevant; and4.
Concluding that there was an abuse on a minority of a class of unsecured creditors and that a duty in this respect was owed by the appellant.
The appellant's submission with respect to the standard of review is that:.","The accused was charged with operating a vehicle when his blood alcohol level exceeded the prescribed limit and impaired driving.
After being involved in an accident, the accused was taken to hospital where a blood demand was given and eventually acceded to.
The accused challenged the validity of the blood demand and argued that his right to counsel was violated.
Accused guilty of operating a vehicle when his blood alcohol level exceeded the prescribed limit; there was no violation of the accused's right to counsel.
The officer had valid grounds to make the demand, having been advised that the accused was in an accident, that someone had said the accused was either high or intoxicated, having smelled a mild odour of alcohol on the accused and the accused having advised him that he only had three beer.
Even if the accused's claim to amnesia for all the events around that time was believed, there was no medical evidence to suggest that he could not understand what the officer said to him at the hospital.
Although his degree of alertness may have fluctuated, he displayed an understanding of the situation by showing appropriate concern for how much he had been drinking and asking questions which showed an understanding of his situation and what speaking to counsel would entail.","[2, 5, 0, 8, 24, 12, 7, 25, 3, 11, 28, 27, 35, 26]"

This action by the plaintiff Wanda MacPhail against the defendants arises as a result of a motor vehicle accident on March 24th, 1993.
It was agreed that one defendant Louise Brodeur does not exist and was simply listed as a defendant by mistake.

The issues before the Court in this trial are as follows:1.
If the defendants, or any of them are liable, what are the plaintiffs damages?
Plaintiff's evidence on liability issue:The plaintiff testified that she is now 37 years old.
She is a nurse by profession, graduating from the V.G.
She was told she could not do that.","An application for a DNA warrant on the basis s.487.05 (the general warrant provision) of the Criminal Code with respect to DNA warrants does not refer to a form.
The applicant suggested a tape recording would avoid the potential problems in bringing the application before a Provincial Court Judge.

An oath taken before a commissioner or notary is as valid as it is before a provincial court judge and avoids all the possible problems that relate to personal attendance.
The intention is to make protocol work as flexible as possible, not impeding the police in their legitimate role, while making sure the court maintains its independence.

DATE OF ORAL DECISION: November 28th, 1997WRITTEN RELEASE OF DECISION: January 28, 1998COUNSEL: Michael Wood, for the Plaintiff T. Arthur Barry, for the DefendantBOUDREAU, J.
(ORAL):This is the decision in the applications of Granview Farms Limited and CBCL Limited.
OVERVIEWGranview Farms Limited, which is the plaintiff in the present action, is the successor corporate entity of Turf Masters Landscaping Limited by virtue of an amalgamation of the two companies.
During 1989 Turf Masters obtained a subcontract to perform most of the work on a recreational park and sports field for the City of Dartmouth.
The consultants for the City on the project were the present defendants, CBCL Limited.
In this earlier evaluation CBCL and Jacques Whitford had produced reports indicating subsurface site instability with significant potential problems.
This resulted in disputes over the contract, but at no time during the work did Turf Masters elect or declare the contract frustrated or otherwise terminated.
Prior to the trial of this first action CBCL had been joined as a third party by the City.
CBCL has made this first application to strike out the statement of claim in the present action on the basis of res judicata or ""cause of action estoppel"", as it is sometimes known, and abuse of process.","The Crown appealed the dismissal of charges of impaired driving and driving with a blood alcohol level exceeding .08.
The trial judge held the circumstances supported a special plea of autrefois acquit and that the manner of proceeding by the Crown was an abuse of process at common law.
Alberta did not withdraw or abandon the charges and suspended his driving privileges for 3 months.
Upon request, SGI also suspended his Saskatchewan driving privileges.
At issue was whether the Alberta court lost jurisdiction; if so, whether that gave rise to a plea of autrefois acquit in Saskatchewan; apart from any loss of jurisdiction did the police procedure amount to an abuse of process at common law.
HELD: The Informations were stayed.
The trial judge erred in finding a plea of autrefois acquit was applicable but was correct in concluding Alberta lost jurisdiction.
1)The Information remained dismissed for want of prosecution.
Jurisdiction over the respondent was lost when the information was not available in the Alberta Provincial Court, the appearance notice was not confirmed and the matter could not be dealt with (R. v. McGinnis).
The Alberta court could have regained jurisdiction by issuing a summons or warrant within 3 months of February 6, 2001.
A summons was not issued until August.
The information was by then deemed to have been dismissed for want of prosecution pursuant to s.485(3).
'Deemed' in s.485(3) does not mean 'presumed until otherwise proven'.
It means that the information is dismissed without any action by the court.
Once dismissed the proceeding could only be recommenced with consent of the Attorney General or leave of the court, neither of which were obtained. 2)With respect to jurisdiction in Saskatchewan, s.476(b) grants concurrent jurisdiction to any province in which the offence may have been committed or committed within 500 metres of any province in order to prevent a charge from failing because of uncertainty as to location.
The section was not intended to permit simultaneous prosecutions in two provinces or in a second province in the event of a failure in the first.
3)The respondent's appearance in a Saskatchewan courtroom as a result of a summons did not revive jurisdiction in Alberta.
The Alberta proceeding was deemed to have been dismissed for want of prosecution on May 6, 2001.
The charges have not been disposed of within the meaning of s.730(3).
There was no finding in respect of which an appeal can be taken.
The special plea of autrefois acquit is not available in these circumstances.
4)The prosecutorial conduct of the police in proceeding simultaneously in two provinces amounted to an abuse of process.
The respondent was obliged to defend identical charges arising out of the same incident in two provinces for almost a year at substantial cost and stress.
The police acted with arbitrary purpose and without regard for the principles of fundamental justice.
The lack of malice or improper motive does not preclude a finding of abuse of process.","[3, 0, 6, 4, 2, 18, 15, 8, 12, 5]"
630,"J.
The accused, Dany Kane, is charged with murder in the first degree.
He did not have the benefit of a preliminary inquiry as a result of the Crown preferring the indictment against him.
There is no evidence before the court on the merits of the case as the trial has yet to begin.
The accused brings this application for a stay of proceedings alleging that his rights under ss.11(d) and 11 (f) of Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms have been infringed due to the pre-trial publicity generated by this case.
The applicants position, in short, is that the pre-trial publicity has prejudiced his right to be tried by an impartial jury of his peers.
It is also argued that the security measures presently in place and focussed on by the media have instilled in the general populous a climate of fear which makes the selection of an impartial jury impossible.
It is argued by the applicant that prejudicial information, which has yet to be ruled admissible by this Court, is contained in many of the media reports aired to date.
The applicant submits that this information is such that it would reasonably be expected to taint the accused in the eyes of the public and that a potential jury has been irreparably prejudiced against him.","FIAT. Saskatoon's daily newspaper applied for access to a CD-ROM entered in evidence at a sentencing hearing in the matter of R. v. Glen Ivor Jones on May 14, 2002.
The journalists had no prior opportunity to hear its contents because Jones entered a guilty plea.
The application was not opposed.
The applicant sought an order for mandamus or a declaration.
HELD: The presumption is in favour of public access to court records and the burden to contrary proof lies with the person who would deny access.
This right is tempered by other factors (see R. v. SJS).
Requiring the journalists to attend at the offices of the Attorney General and playing the CD ROM and making their own notes balances the interests of innocent parties whose conversations were recorded.","[3, 4, 2, 8, 5, 6, 1, 7, 13]"

Saunders on June 10, 1999DECISION June 10, 1999 (Orally)COUNSEL: John Scott, Esq., for the Crown Deirdre Murphy for the Accused SAUNDERS, J.: (Orally) Mr. Nathan Peter Dykstra elected trial by judge alone on this charge of robbery.
I presided at your trial April 22 and 23, 1999.
You took the stand in your own defence.
I was satisfied based upon all of the evidence presented as to your guilt on the charge on the Indictment and I remanded you into custody pending your sentence this morning.
I was satisfied that you all waited together in the dark by a wall of Eaton’s parkade at the Halifax Shopping Centre to see who might happen to pass by as a mark.
Upon seeing Mr. Daniels you chased after him and ran him down and proceeded to beat him with kicks and punches while stealing his belongings.
Mr. Daniels tried to defend himself but he was no match against the five of you.
Mr. Daniels was badly beaten by you and the four others who joined you in that cowardly and senseless attack.","Both sought to vary the June 30, 1999 child support order under which the father was to pay monthly child support of $987 based on an income of $80,278.
He ceased paying when the children did not attend school full-time.
The 21 year old worked for several years before returning to his mother's home in August 2001 and commencing full-time studies.
He continued to work part-time and obtained student loans and a student line of credit.
The daughter resumed living with her mother in January 2002 and was attending university full-time.
Both adult children were assuming responsibility for most of their education costs by taking student loans.
The mother's position was the father should pay the table amount of support for both children and his proportionate share of post-secondary expenses not covered by student loans.
At issue also was payment of arrears for July to December 2001.
HELD: 1)The father was to pay $1,153 per month for support for the adult children for the months of September to April inclusive, pursuant to s.3(2)(a) and 3(1)(a) of the Guidelines.
Based on the criteria set forth in Farden and Zaba, both children were children of the marriage as contemplated by the Act.
They were involved in the reasonable pursuit of post-secondary education and neither was able to withdraw from the charge of their parents.
It was appropriate to determine the obligation in accordance with s.3(2)(a).
The student loans covered most direct education expenses of tuition, books and fees.
The line of credit was not considered a part of the son's means available to meet his needs.
The father has a reasonably substantial income ($96,300) and cannot seek to reduce or avoid a child support obligation by guaranteeing a loan, which the child will have to repay.
Child support arrears for July to December 2001 for the son to a total of $2,872 were payable at a rate of $718 per month.
The daughter's needs were met while attending university in Alberta.
 3)While it would appear beyond debate that an adult child must make reasonable efforts to contribute to his or her support and education, it is not so clear how this is to be applied to an individual circumstance.
The principles enunciated in Francis were recast in the context of s.3(2).
A similar summary, albeit with respect to an application under s.4, is found in Metzner as reiterated in MacDonald.
It is clear from Francis that determining inappropriateness is not a matter of the court determining what the budget ought to be and whether a Table amount exceeds that budget.
To revert to such an approach is to undermine the presumptive rule and legislated objectives of predictability, consistency and efficiency.
4)The father was to pay his proportionate share (80%) of any expenses not covered within 30 days of such funds being due.
If the parties were unable to work out an adjustment for any unused education tax credit, an application may be brought to court. 5)The mother was awarded her costs of the application fixed at $750.","[3, 4, 0, 5, 8, 9, 7, 13, 2, 1]"

07689 IN THE SUPREME COURT OF NOVA SCOTIA BETWEEN:Fairview Farms Limited and M.S.D.
The dispute in this case is about how to interpret an agreement signed by three brothers in 1988 by which they reorganized their father’s farming operation.
The brothers, Gene, Merle and Lorne Putnam, each formed a new company at that time with Gene owning Fairview Farms Limited; Merle owning M.S.D.
Enterprises Limited, and Lorne owning A.A. Putnam & Sons (l987) Limited.
The plaintiffs request rectification of the agreement terms in regard to the sharing by all three of them in the proceeds from any sales of milk quota by Lorne Putnam’s company.
For easy reference, I intend to refer to the brothers by name instead of by their respective company name.
FACTS Prior to l987, the three brothers operated a farming operation with their father under the company name of A.A. Putnam & Sons Limited.
That company was formed in l967.
They all worked in different aspects of the company.
The first document signed was on June 17th, 1987.
It provided for the basic reorganization of the various activities.
The agreement provided by Article 4 that there were a number of conditions precedent to the new reorganization.","The Agency applied for the permanent care of four young children, aged 2 to 5 years.
The three youngest children had been in the Agency's temporary care and the oldest child had been in the supervised care of her paternal grandparents.
The family had come to the Agency's notice due to problems with money, food shortage and housing.
Despite several years of assistance from a Family Skills Worker and Parent Aid, concerns remained as to the mother's willingness and ability to care for her children.
The oldest child had continuously moved between her biological father's home (which was often with the mother) and her paternal grandparents.
The biological father had custody of her at the present time.
The paternal grandparents wanted custody of both the oldest and youngest children, whom they believed to be their son's children.
Application granted; the oldest child to be placed in the supervised care of her paternal grandmother and the biological father is not to live in that home; both parents can have supervised carefully monitored access to that child (if access is not exercised by either party, that access will be terminated); the three youngest children are to be placed in the permanent care of the Agency for the purposes of adoption with both parents' access to these children to be weaned.
Access between all four children will continue at least until it becomes impossible due to the current adoption law in the province.
Although the expert evidence presented by the Agency was rejected due to its apparent lack of objectivity and the fact that the experts appeared biased by their access to the entire Children's Aid file which contained numerous unproven allegations, the court found that despite extensive remedial measures provided to the family, all four children would be at risk of harm if returned to either parent due to an environment of absence of necessities, multiple moves, one child having witnessed physical violence, medical needs not having been met, basic hygiene not having been met and basic supervision and safety concerns not having been met.
The father failed to either protect the children or provide the necessities for them.
Both parents were not willing to accept input from any professional.
Neither parent could, nor wished to, change in the foreseeable future.","[9, 4, 2, 0, 7, 10, 8, 1, 5, 16, 19, 6, 13, 17]"

The original order is dated October 20, 1999 and an amended order changing several of the conditions is dated October 26, 1999.
On the same date as the amended order, the Crown applied for a review under s. 680(1) of the Code.

In the commentary following s. 680, it states in part: ...
An application is made to the chief justice or acting chief justice of the court of appeal for a direction that the decision be reviewed by the court of appeal.","An application for summary judgment pursuant to Queen's Bench Rule 184(1)(a) and/or Queen's Bench Act s.29 in accordance with the minutes of settlement agreed to follow the pre-trial conference.
The defendant did not file affidavit evidence but opposed the application solely on the basis that recent amendments to the Queen's Bench Act precludes reference to minutes of settlement.
HELD: The plaintiff was entitled to enter judgment for $15,000 plus costs of this application.
A settlement agreement reduced to writing in no way offends the confidentiality required under s.28.1.
The plaintiff is entitled to rely on the minutes of settlement and must be permitted to refer to them in his affidavit.
Section 28.1 is not meant to apply to this situation.

Edwards PLACE HEARD: Port Hood, Nova Scotia DATE HEARD: November 19, 1999 DECISION: Written - December 22, 1999 COUNSEL: Réjean Aucoin, Esq., for the Appellant Laurie Halfpenny MacQuarrie for the Respondent Edwards, J.:The issue in this appeal is whether a Provincial Court Judge is obligated to advise an unrepresented accused of his right to trial in either or both of the official languages of Canada pursuant to Section 530(1) of the Criminal Code.
If so, what are the consequences of a Provincial Court Judge’s failure to do so?
The facts are brief and not in dispute.
The Appellant appeared unrepresented by Counsel in Provincial Court in Port Hood on March 31, 1998.
He was read the charge in English by the Learned Provincial Court Judge.
The Appellant pleaded not guilty to Section 266 of the Criminal Code.
At trial, the Appellant was represented by Counsel.
The sole ground of appeal relates to the failure of the Provincial Court Judge to advise the Appellant of his rights to a trial in French or English pursuant to Section 530 of the Code.","The plaintiff claims that his father intended to designate him as the sole beneficiary of a $60,000 mutual fund but that this plan was defeated by the negligence of the defendants.
The defendant admitted he was aware of the deceased's intention to leave the investment to his son.
The defendant entered the plaintiff's name in the beneficiary designation portions of the fund application.
However, the beneficiary designation was void by virtue of the mutual fund being non-registered.
The defendant gave evidence that he advised the deceased that he would have to make a specific bequest in his will.
The deceased made no special designation in his will and, at his death, the investment became part of the residue of his estate and was divided between the plaintiff and his sister.
HELD: The plaintiff was awarded judgment against the defendant Nordstrom for half the value of the investment at its maturity, plus pre-judgment interest and costs.
 1) Nordstrom was a professional, who held himself out as possessing special skill, judgment and knowledge in financial planning.
The advice and information provided to the deceased was provided in the course of the defendant's business.
The defendant had a financial interest in the transaction and was cognizant of the fact that the realization of the deceased's intent to benefit the plaintiff was dependent upon there being a valid beneficiary designation.
The products sold by the defendant are used as estate planning tools.
The intervention of death removed any opportunity to correct the matter and, without the application of the Wilhelm principle, this financial planner would go scott free and the plaintiff would bear the loss.
The 'disappointed beneficiary' principle was applicable in this case.","[0, 2, 3, 4, 1, 6, 5, 9, 11]"

Although the medical charts exceeded 1500 pages, the more relevant hospital records were less than 100 pages; the essence of the liability issue would be limited in time, in the most relevant anatomical area and in the number of medical personnel involved in the relevant interventions; the factual material did not appear to be in dispute; and the issues were no more complex than most causation issues presented in medical malpractice cases.","[1, 0, 4, 2, 5, 8, 6, 9, 10, 13, 3, 7, 11]"

Farrar for the respondent MACADAM, J.:[1] The plaintiff injured his right knee when he tripped over a “dolly-cart” while attending at the premises of the defendant, J.D.
Irving Limited, doing business under the firm name and style of Kent Building Supplies (herein “Kent”) at Bayers Lake Business Park, Halifax, Nova Scotia.
[2] The plaintiff operates a sole proprietorship known as Markham Contracting which is involved in house renovations through the winter period and landscaping in the summer.
On Wednesday, July 5, 1995, he was attending the Kent premises to pick up lumber and other materials for a job on which he was working.
When he entered the building, he did not notice a “dolly” or other obstruction by the contractor’s desk and when he returned he was positioned on the side of the desk facing towards the glass doors.
As he turned the corner of the desk, he tripped over the end of a “dolly” which had been placed with the handle end against the side of the contractor’s desk.
The cart extended approximately four feet into the aisle separating the contractor’s desk from the display aisles located directly across.","The accused made an application to the Court of Queen's Bench under s. 515 of the Criminal Code and s. 33(8) and s. 13(2) of The Youth Criminal Justice Act for interim judicial release of the accused pending his preliminary inquiry on a charge of murder.
The accused had previously applied to a Provincial Court judge, who had declined the accused's application.
The issue was whether the Youth Court judge in Provincial Court had the jurisdiction to hear and determine the accused's application for judicial interim release.
HELD: The jurisdiction for determination of interim judicial release of a young person charged with murder under the Youth Criminal Justice Act rests solely with the superior court of criminal jurisdiction, which is the Court of Queen's Bench in Saskatchewan.","[4, 2, 1, 0, 6, 7, 9, 5, 11, 12]"
637,"S.H.C.R.
COUNSEL: John Scott, Esq., Counsel for the Crown.
Brad Sarson, Esq., Counsel for the Defence.
Reverend Wrenford Bryant - Surety Hall, J.
[1] The Crown has applied pursuant to s. 771 for an order forfeiting the amount of bail set out in a recognizance entered into by the accused, Lloyd Eugene Bailey, and the surety, Reverend Wrenford Bryant, in the amount of $1,000.00, which was given to secure the release of the accused pending his trial on a number of criminal charges.
[2] The question for the court to decide here is whether, in the circumstances of this case, forfeiture should be ordered against the accused or the surety or both.
[3] The accused was charged with four offences with respect to a twelve year old girl which allegedly occurred during the month of December, 1997.
[4] It appears that the accused was arrested in December of 1997 and remanded in custody at the Halifax Correction Centre pending posting of bail which was set at $1,000.00 with a surety.
The surety, Mr. Bryant, visited the accused at the Halifax Correction Centre and agreed to be a surety.
He then appeared before a justice of the peace at the Correction Centre and signed the recognizance.
A condition of the recognizance was that the accused appear in court when required to do so and that he continue to reside at his then residence on Brunswick Street in the City of Halifax.","FIAT: The defendant applied for security for costs in the amount of $50,000.
HELD: The plaintiff was required to supply security for costs in the amount of $18,000.
1) The defendant proved facts, which demonstrated the existence of several of the criteria listed in Rule 538 of the Queen's Bench Rules of Court.
The plaintiff failed to establish any of the situations listed in Rule 539.
 2) The presence of a counterclaim does not necessarily or automatically prohibit the granting of an order for security for costs.
Rather, it is a factor to be considered.
In this case, the counterclaim was not a wholly distinct claim.
It arises in respect of the same matter and transaction as the claim proper. 3)
The defendant commenced the builders' lien action, long before filing a defence and counterclaim within this action.
Had the counterclaim not been filed, an order for security for costs as requested would have been appropriate.
It is somewhat artificial to now deny that relief because of the counterclaim, which has the effect of facilitating a disposition of all matters within one proceeding.
4) The plaintiff applied ex parte under s. 56(1) of The Builders' Lien Act to have the defendant's lien vacated.
The application was granted, but the plaintiff was required to post security for costs in the amount of $50,000.
The Builders' Lien Act does not impede the jurisdiction of this Court to deal with the application of the defendant.","[3, 2, 6, 0, 4, 7, 9, 10, 11, 13, 5]"

Under s. 198 of the Act, a hearing was held to determine certain facts.
The parties agree the appellant was a non-earner as defined by the Act, who was involved in a motor vehicle accident and suffered injuries to an extent that he is not able to carry on gainful employment as a skidder operator.
The appellant estimated that he should receive an income replacement benefit (IRB) based on yearly wages in excess of $50,000.
This position was based on employment promised to the appellant that would have started during the first 180 days following the accident.
The respondent submits that the weighted average approach sets the IRB much lower, as in the previous 3 years the appellant earned no more than $12,000 per year.
HELD: 1) The IRB must reflect a claimant's earning reality.
The appellant's earning reality was far from the promised employment.
The Court found that the appellant's earning reality was working for employment income no more than half the time and the IRB ought to be calculated accordingly.
 2) The benefits referred to in s. 20 of the Regulations include employment bonuses, tips, overtime, and personal use of a motor vehicle.
There is no requirement to include employment insurance benefits in the calculation required for s. 24(1) of the Regulations. 3)
Counsel for the appellant was entitled to solicitor-client costs as provided by s. 198(5) of the Act and Regulation 101.","[1, 0, 4, 6, 5, 3, 8, 9, 10, 7, 12, 11, 2, 14, 16, 20, 18, 15]"

In the interim, counsel for both parties submitted post-hearing briefs to the Court for its consideration.
Jennifer Purdy, a 21-year old friend of the accused Jessica Dale Knox, testified that on the evening of October 16th, 1999 she and Jessica drove into Halifax from Terrence Bay in a white Corsica motor vehicle.
She estimated some six to seven people were in attendance at Ms. Hodge’s apartment, including Ms. Hodge and a male friend from the United States called Phil.
Ms. Knox’s car was left on Green Street and the group walked to the Pacifico.
Ms. Purdy stated the accused had a vodka and Sprite at the Pacifico.
According to Ms. Purdy, at no time to that point did Ms. Knox have any difficulty in speaking, standing or walking.
Ms. Purdy further states that Phil and Jessica Knox each had a beer from the fridge.","The parties were married for 13 years and had three children.
Both parties appeared to have a standard of living higher than their personal annual income would dictate; the husband by funneling many of his personal expenses through his company and the wife with the financial assistance of her parents.

In addition to the matrimonial home, the parties owned various rental properties.
Joint custody of the children ordered with primary day to day care to be with the wife; in the event that the parties cannot agree on any major issue concerning the children, the final decision will be made by the wife; income attributed to the husband for child support purposes; piano lessons and musical instruments found to be extraordinary expenses within the meaning of s. 7 of the Guidelines but soccer, tennis and horseback riding are not; no spousal support ordered; all property equally divided.
The wife's father had given her one rental property from which the rental proceeds went to the mortgage and into the parties' joint bank account; the husband was extensively involved in the operation of the property.
This property was found to be a gift to the wife that became a matrimonial asset during the marriage as it was operated as a family venture.
A second rental property was purchased by the husband and the wife's brother; the wife considered herself a partner in the venture even though her name was left off the deed.

This went on between 1996 - 1999.
Mr. MacPherson was overpaid in the amount of $19,156.00 and Mr. MacDonald in the amount of $32,866.00.

Pursuant to the Corollary Relief judgment, the husband was currently paying the wife $4,350 per month as spousal support.
The wife now wished to increase the monthly support to a figure which would more closely resemble that assessed pursuant to the Spousal Support Advisory Guidelines, along with a substantial lump sum to compensate her for the underpayment of spousal support for the past two years.
She also sought removal of a clause which provided for the discontinuation of support if the husband's professional income dropped below $80,000.
The parties had been married for approximately thirty years and had one child, who was now independent.
Application dismissed;
the parties' current circumstances did not constitute a significant departure from the range of reasonable outcomes anticipated by the parties when the Agreement was signed.
Both parties' income had increased since the divorce and the wife was not deeply in debt, as she alleged; there was no pressure exerted and no oppression during the course of negotiations; the Spousal Support Advisory Guidelines are not law and allow for exceptions to the general formulas provided, one such exception being the assumption of debt by one of the parties (the husband in this case); the spousal support figure recognized the husband's reasonable expectation of retirement and the fact that he was experiencing health problems; it was completely foreseeable at the time that the Agreement was signed that, given the wife's age, she might experience difficulty in finding employment in her narrow field; the subsequent increased value of one of the husband's properties was not a reason to vary the spousal support provisions of the Agreement.","[0, 1, 3, 2, 4, 6, 5, 8, 7, 9, 10, 11]"

FLINN, J.A.
:BACKGROUND[1] Following a trial in the Supreme Court, before Justice Simon MacDonald and a jury, the appellant was convicted of four offences, under the Criminal Code of Canada R.S.C.
1985, c. C-46, arising out of her operation of a motor vehicle.
[2] The appellant appeals her conviction, and raises numerous grounds of appeal.
In none of these grounds of appeal does the appellant take the position that the jury’s verdict is unreasonable and cannot be supported by the evidence.
Nevertheless, it would be helpful, before dealing with the appellant’s grounds of appeal, to provide a background, and to set out in some detail the evidence which the jury heard in this case.
The MacRae motor vehicle veered to the left, into the opposite lane, to avoid the appellant’s motor vehicle.
Just as the MacRae motor vehicle made that maneuver, the appellant’s motor vehicle veered back into its own lane.
Both the appellant, who was alone in her car, and Barbara MacRae were injured.
FACTS[4] The following summarizes the evidence which the jury heard at this trial.
[6] Frank MacRae also testified.
He testified as to what he, then, observed, as follows:Q.","The appellant appeal arguing that the respondent's conduct in soliciting the customers of the appellant constituted a breach of contract.
HELD: Appeal dismissed orally.
Even if the respondent's conduct constituted a breach of the clause of the contract prohibiting him from soliciting the customers of the appellant, the appellant failed to prove any loss attributable to the breach.
The appellant's loss consisted of its inability to continue to obtain Mato products and sell them to its customers at a profit.
This loss stemmed from the termination of its distributorship agreement with Mato, not from anything the respondent did.
As the trial judge found, the termination of the distributorship was unconnected to the respondent.","[3, 9, 20, 0, 4, 30, 11, 6, 5, 10, 18, 39, 15, 7, 14]"
642,"Date: 2002-05-30 Docket: 998806-998828 2002NSPC20 IN THE PROVINCIAL COURTHER MAJESTY THE QUEENVERSUSPAUL HENNEBERRY DECISIONHEARD BEFORE: The Honourable Associate Chief Judge R. Brian GibsonDATE HEARD: December 3, 2001PLACE HEARD: Dartmouth, Nova ScotiaCHARGES: 12 counts under S.238(1) of the Income Tax Act.
COUNSEL: David Bright, for the Crown Kent Clarke, for the Defence[1] Mr. Paul Henneberry has pled guilty to 12 counts of failing to comply with the provisions of subsection 153(1) of the Income Tax Act by failing to remit to the Receiver General of Canada, money deducted and withheld from salaries, wages or other remuneration paid to the employees of Halifax Regional Protection Services Limited (herein referred to H.R.P.S.).
The total sum deducted and unpaid amounted to $22,069.23.
These offences occurred between the dates of February 16, 1999 and January 18, 2000.
[2] I imposed the minimum fine of $1000 for each of these offences pursuant to the provisions of subsection 238(1) of the Income Tax Act.
[3] At the time the 12 guilty pleas were tendered and the fines imposed, there was a dispute between the Crown and Mr. Henneberry regarding the implication of outstanding bankruptcy proceedings in relation to the issuance of a subsection 238(2) compliance order.
The matter was adjourned to receive further submissions from counsel for both parties.","The plaintiffs seek damages arising from the alleged nuisance and negligence caused the defendants in the operation of the golf course.
The plaintiffs also seek an injunction to prohibit the defendants from continuing to operate the golf course in a manner that causes errant golf balls to enter the plaintiffs' property.
HELD: 1)
The court looked at other jurisdictions for guidance as to what number of errant balls might constitute a nuisance.
It would appear that anything from 200 golf balls and up over the span of a year is definitely an unreasonable interference with the use and enjoyment of one's own property.
Over a span of 9 years, the plaintiffs have had approximately 1,000 golf balls per year enter their property.
In this case, the number of golf balls being hit onto the adjacent properties from the defendant's golf course is far greater than the number cited in many of the cases put forward.
There is no doubt then that the present operation of the ninth hole is a nuisance and continues to be a nuisance.
 2) The wording of the Optionee's Indemnity clause is of little value to the defendants given the evidence of the parties.
The evidence confirms that when the residential area was developed and the contract signed, no one, including the operator, anticipated the extent of the existing problem.
Accordingly, the plaintiffs could not have agreed to save the defendant harmless from a problem of this magnitude.
3) The plaintiffs will be compensated for the extensive physical damaged to the plaintiffs' properties, but also for the loss of the use and enjoyment of their yards for 7 months of the year.
4) The plaintiffs are entitled to injunctive relief to put an end to the nuisance that has continued for the past 9 years.
The defendants are enjoined from allowing golfers from hitting golf balls on the ninth hole so that they land anywhere near the plaintiffs' property.","[4, 3, 1, 2, 7, 6, 0]"

[2] Mr. Burton lost control of his vehicle as he rounded a curve at the top of a hill near the Fire Hall at Cape North, Victoria County, Nova Scotia.
Witnesses put the time at shortly after 8:00 a.m..
He was the lone occupant.
[3] Kirk Lawrence viewed the driving from the rear.
The sound of squealing tires drew his attention to the vehicle.
He saw it lose control at the top of the hill.
He described the car as being half on the road and half on the shoulder.
Although he then lost sight of the vehicle, he heard it go down over the bank a second or two later.
[5] Yvonne Daisley had a front view of the oncoming vehicle through her windshield.
[6] There is no indication from any of these eye witnesses of poor road or weather conditions, or any unusual hazards, that might contribute to an accident of this sort.
There is no evidence of mechanical defects or failures in the defendant’s vehicle.
[7] A paramedic with EMS Nova Scotia, Greg Lawrence, happened to be nearby.
He thus put the time as 8:05.
In the opinion of William Burton, the defendant was “impaired”.","The respondent applies to vary the consent joint custody order granted in October 2004.
His application was prompted by the relocation of the petitioner with one of their two children, Tyson.
The sole issue on this variation application is the determination of the primary residence of Tyson.
HELD: 1)
The petitioner wants to move Tyson 5.5 hours away from the respondent.
This also requires a change in access arrangements.
These are changes in circumstances that are material.
 2) The petitioner has developed a strong bond with Tyson.
The respondent has developed a close relationship with the parties' other child Kailey.
After Kailey went to live with the respondent, neither parent did much to facilitate the access of either child.
Before the petitioner and Tyson moved, although a short distance apart, neither Kailey nor Tyson saw his or her non-custodial parent and sibling on a regular basis.
Even telephone access has been sporadic.
Both parents have established homes that accommodate only one child. 3)
The petitioner's move must be considered in light of the circumstances that existed before the petitioner's relocation.
The parties had already adopted a split custody arrangement without formalizing access or adjusting child support.
4) Permitting the petitioner to relocate is in the best interests of Tyson.
It is important that Tyson continue to live in the home of the parent whose constant presence he has become accustomed to.
The petitioner has always been Tyson's primary caregiver.
The petitioner is the psychological parent.","[1, 5, 4, 7, 3, 2, 19, 8, 18, 32, 12, 20, 22, 9, 6]"
644,"IN THE SUPREME COURT OF NOVA SCOTIA Citation: Barnard v. Her Majesty the Queen, 2002 NSSC 250Date: 2002/11/13 Docket: S.H.
[2] On November 17th, 2001 the appellant spent the morning and most of the afternoon with friends in a local pub in Halifax and then proceeded to a football game, the Atlantic Bowl, and eventually to a lounge at the campus where the football game was played.
When he left the lounge with his friends, the appellant gave a lift to his friends.
Having dropped off all but one of his friends at a downtown point, the appellant then drove his vehicle towards the spot where he eventually parked.
In entering Spring Garden Road, a busy thoroughfare within the downtown core of the City, the right side of the appellant’s vehicle rubbed against a parked vehicle.
[3] This incident was seen by police officers who followed him to where he parked his vehicle.
The officers told the appellant he had struck a parked vehicle and then one of them accompanied the appellant back to the parked car.
While doing so the officer detected the smell of alcohol and noted certain other features about the appellant, prompting him to request the appellant take an “alert”, an approved screening device having read to the appellant the requisite demand.
When the appellant “failed” this test the officer requested the appellant take the Breathalyzer test, which the appellant refused.","A single vehicle accident occurred when the driver swerved to avoid hitting a dog that ran onto the highway.
An action was brought against both the driver and the farmer who owned the land on both sides of the highway on the basis that the farmer owned the dog in question and was negligent in failing to keep it off the highway.
The farmer contended that although he owned a dog, it was tied to a tree at the time and his was not the dog that had run onto the highway.
When his application for summary judgment was dismissed, the farmer appealed.
Appeal dismissed.
At this stage of the proceedings, it was not necessary for the plaintiffs to prove that the defendant's dog contributed to the accident or the truth of the statements and evidence attached to the affidavit.
It was only necessary to show that the facts were contested, there was some evidence to support their version of events and, if their evidence was accepted by the trier of fact, their action had some merit.
Although the judge appeared to blur the two parts of the test on a summary judgment application, the Court found that the farmer failed to meet the first part of the test; namely, that there was no genuine issue of fact for trial as there was conflicting evidence as to the identity of the dog involved.","[0, 3, 4, 2, 6, 5, 9, 7, 8]"

#2 of Bridgewater was selling marihuana for $13.00 a gram.
The source advised if a person purchased a gram of marihuana and mushrooms, the cost was $22.00 total.
The informant also stated he/she had purchased marihuana from Mr. Rhodenizer in the past and that Mr. Rhodenizer purchases his narcotics from the city.

The appellant asserts a palpable and overriding error by the learned trial judge in accepting, and finding as fact, part of the testimony of a witness but not accepting the further testimony of the witness that an amount was also owing to the appellant by the respondent.
HELD: The appeal is dismissed.
The trial judge was not required to accept the entirety of the witness's testimony, despite having accepted most of it, particularly in light of the contradictory evidence of the respondent denying the sum claimed by the appellant.
The denial by the respondent of the appellant's claim, accepted by the trial judge, was fatal to the appellant's onus of proving a mutual understanding and absolute acknowledgement of the alleged debt between the parties.","[9, 3, 8, 1, 4, 10, 7, 17, 11, 6]"

The certificate of analysis was excluded as a result of the trial judge's decision that the accused's s. 8 Charter Rights had been violated.
The trial judge found that the officer did not have reasonable and probable grounds to make the breathalyzer demand.
HELD: The trial judge erred in determining that in the totality of the circumstances it was not objectively reasonable for the officer to have relied on the accuracy of the ASD test.
A new trial is ordered.
 1) There is no fixed rule or formula that an officer must follow when determining whether or not to wait 15 minutes prior to administering a road side test.
In this case, the trial judge appears to have concluded that the officer who administered the ASD would not have relied on the results, or should not have so relied, if her partner had informed her of the empty beer can with fresh suds in it that he found at the scene.
Implicit in this finding is the conclusion that the existence of the beer can would make a difference to the officer's assessment of whether she should wait 15 minutes for any mouth alcohol to dissipate before she could rely on ASD test results. 2)
The trial judge made the same error that was dealt with by the Ontario Court of Appeal in R. v. Einarson. 3)
The accused told the officer that he had been drinking in the car 'earlier'.
Even if the officer had been told of her partner's discovery of an empty beer can at the scene, it would not constitute 'credible evidence' that the accused consumed alcohol within that 15 minute time frame.
Whether or not the accused had consumed beer within 15 minutes of taking the test on the ASD is pure speculation.","[2, 3, 5, 1, 6, 7, 10, 11, 13, 8, 16, 12, 14]"

Counsel: Theresa Marie Forgeron, for the appellant respondent not appearingReasons for judgment:[1] Ms. Terry appeals an order of Vernon MacDonald, J.S.C.
(Fam.
Div.)
which, in response to an application by Mr. Francis to vary a child maintenance order, reduced his child maintenance obligation to $1.00 per month.
Ms. Terry submits that the judge erred in principle by allowing Mr. Francis’ variation application to proceed even though he had not made adequate disclosure of his financial situation.
I agree.
[2] Mr. Francis and Ms. Terry are the parents of two children, aged 6 and 7.
On July 2, 2002, in response to an earlier variation application by Mr. Francis, M. C. MacLellan, J.S.C.(Fam.
Div.)
affirmed the amount of maintenance set out in an earlier order in the monthly amount of $265 and confirmed the considerable arrears payable under that order.","The accused was charged with resisting arrest contrary to s. 129(a) of the Criminal Code.
The defence argued that there were insufficient grounds for the accused's arrest and he was therefore justified in resisting his detention.
The Crown's position was that the police were justified in arresting the accused for being drunk in public.
HELD: The Crown has proved beyond a reasonable doubt that the officers were engaged in the lawful execution of their duty when the accused resisted their efforts to arrest him pursuant to The Summary Offences Procedure Act.
There was a complaint to police concerning the accused.
He was heard and seen banging on the door of an apartment.
He smelled of alcohol.
He was slightly unsteady on his feet and he was yelling and swearing at the police.
Given the complaint and the observations made by the attending constables, it was reasonable for them to believe that the accused was intoxicated due to the use of alcohol.
He was causing a disturbance to others.
Prior to his arrest, the accused began to yell at the officers in a parking lot which is, without any doubt, a public place.
No one else was present who may have been capable and willing to take charge of the accused.
The defence argued that in these circumstances the arresting officers should have questioned that accused as to where else he might go to sleep off his intoxication.
The Crown submitted that in circumstances such as this, the police are not required to sit down and discuss with the accused where he might go.
In the Court's view, s. 52(2) of The Summary Offences Procedure Act should be interpreted as meaning that there must be no other person present at the scene who is capable and willing to take care of the person who is subject to arrest.
There was no such person in this case.
The arrest was, on these facts, lawful.","[1, 3, 4, 2, 5, 0, 6, 7, 8, 10, 9, 11, 13, 14, 12, 15]"

Reasons for judgment:I.
Introduction:[1] A cocaine fuelled encounter between the appellant and the woman with whom he was living resulted in his conviction for assault and sexual assault.
[2] In my view, the appeal should be dismissed.
There was ample evidence which, if believed, justified the conviction.
The judge=s reasons, while brief and far from masterful, do not disclose a misapplication of the burden of proof and are not so deficient as to themselves constitute an error of law.
II.
Overview of the Evidence:[3] At the brief trial, three witnesses, C.J.
(who was the alleged victim), a police officer and the appellant, testified.
[4] C.J.
As a result, the appellant thought , and C.J.","The tenant appeals the decision of the Hearing Officer granting her landlord a possession order of her rental premises.
The tenant received notice of the hearing late on Friday when the hearing was set for Tuesday morning.
She immediately requested an adjournment as she was unable to attend personally.
The tenant also submits that the notice failed to disclose a significant aspect of the complaint, namely the conduct of her boyfriend.
HELD: Appeal allowed and the matter returned to the Director to schedule a new hearing with at least 7 days clear notice to be given of the date.
The decision to grant an adjournment is inherently discretionary and should be made with a view to what is necessary to ensure justice is done between the parties.
This should include consideration of the complexity of the issues, the tenant's personal circumstances affecting her ability to attend in person on short notice and any prejudice to the landlord if the request is granted.
There is no evidence that any of this was considered by the Hearing Officer.
Three days (including a weekend) is not sufficient time to make arrangements and prepare for any hearing.
It is clear that the tenant took the matter seriously and spent considerable time preparing written responses to the landlord's claim as she knew it to be.
On the issue of sufficiency of the Notice, the Court found that while the Notice outlined many issues, it failed to disclose issues relating to her boyfriend.
Since these issues were only discussed at the hearing the tenant was unable to attend she was not able to advise in person or in writing that her boyfriend was now incarcerated and the issue resolved.
The Hearing Officer, in accepting evidence from the landlord about the boyfriend when neither the Hearing notice nor the landlord's complaint contained notice of it, breached the rule of natural justice and due process.
The reasonableness standard of review applies here.","[4, 9, 5, 6, 13, 2, 10, 12, 16, 1, 22, 15, 18, 7, 17, 14]"

Counsel: Vincent Gillis, for the appellant/ respondent by cross-appeal Aidan Meade and John W. MacDonald, for the respondent/appellant by cross-appealReasons for judgment:I.
Roper commenced work under the contract in July of 1985 and continued working until the contract was terminated by Devco in March of 1986.
[2] Devco sued, claiming that Roper had been unable to provide the services required under the contract.
Roper defended and counterclaimed in negligent misstatement and breach of contract.
Roper also alleged various breaches of contract by Devco including wrongful termination.
[3] The action was tried over nearly 30 days before MacAdam, J. in the Supreme Court (reported at (2001), 2001 NSSC 179 (CanLII), 202 N.S.R.
(2d) 201).
[4] The judge assessed damages in favour of Devco in the amount of $270,307.05.
These damages related mainly to the costs incurred by Devco in obtaining substituted performance of the contract and the refund of overpayments made to Roper for which no work had been performed.
These damages related to Roper’s additional effort, costs and expenses beyond that contemplated in the contract.
Aside from that, he awarded nothing to Roper.","A couple signed a separation agreement which included a provision whereby they agreed to renounce and waive any claim in the estate of the other and any right to share in the estate of the other, which terms were incorporated into a corollary relief judgment.
When he died, the former husband had not changed his will, which left the residue of his estate to his former wife.
The Chambers judge held that the separation agreement had not revoked the will and the former wife was entitled to the testamentary gift.
The mother of the deceased appealed.
Appeal dismissed;
although the Chambers judge's reasoning was flawed, the appellant had failed to produce any legal authority that a contractual promise to renounce, given for consideration before the death of a former spouse, binds a person to renounce a testamentary gift after his death.
Even if the former spouse were so bound, there did not appear to be any privity of contract which would allow the appellant, who was not a party to the separation agreement, to enforce it.","[2, 10, 8, 12, 3, 14, 19, 4, 16, 13, 20, 17, 7, 1]"
651,"[2] The parties were married in Halifax on the 21st day of November, 1980, and began living separate and apart on August 3, 1993.
They entered into Minutes of Settlement in February, 1996.
This agreement was incorporated into the Corollary Relief Judgment and the Divorce Judgment pronounced the 24th day of April, 1996.
The children remained with their mother in her custody at the date of separation.
They are now 24, 23, 20 and 18 years old respectively.
[4] Prior to the Minutes of Settlement there was a consent order out of the Family Court wherein Dr. Boucher was to pay $6,000 per month.
The Minutes of Settlement required the father to pay the mother the sum of $15,000 to settle all outstanding maintenance arrears accumulated to December 1, 1995.
[5] Commencing December, 1995 until July, 1996, the father paid to the mother for her support and the support of the children the sum of $2,000 every two weeks.
The father took responsibility for $69,500 in matrimonial debt and any other debt in his name.
[10] The changes that have occurred since then are considerable:(1) (a) In June, 1999, Gillian graduated from high school.
She went to Scotland for one-half year to pursue her education.
The father provided financial support directly to her.","The issues on appeal are whether the parties' children, who were over the age of 18, had withdrawn from the father's charge and were no longer children of the marriage within the meaning of the Divorce Act and therefore disentitled to maintenance after September 2006 when they attended post-secondary education and whether the maintenance paid in the past by the father was sufficient and appropriate.
HELD: Appeal allowed.
The trial judge made no palpable and overriding error in his finding that the father was not in arrears of maintenance and that there would be no order for retroactive child support.
Nevertheless, the trial judge was in error in determining that the children were no longer children of the marriage within the meaning of the Act.
The matter is remitted to the trial judge to determine the extent to which the father is obligated to pay maintenance for the children after September 2006.
 1) The father and daughters did not have a conventional relationship.
The father separated from the mother and daughters early and, since he lived in Hong Kong, could only have a long-distance relationship.
The relationship deteriorated in 2006.
It would be accurate to describe the daughters as treating their father with disdain.
However, this does not necessarily mean that the daughters had withdrawn from the relationship with the father unilaterally.
The father could have stayed in contact with the daughters despite the litigation and their failure to provide him with academic records.
The father's efforts to contact the daughters were no greater than the daughters' to contact him.
The father recognized the financial dependency of the daughters.
Their dependency did not end because of the lack of communication.
2) The trial judge placed too much emphasis on the daughters' poor treatment and disdain of the father.
His finding that the daughters did not wish to maintain a meaningful relationship with the father misapprehends the evidence respecting the historical and ongoing nature of their relationship.
The fact that the emphasis of the relationship after 2003 shifted does not imply that they had no meaningful relationship in their own way.
The proper conclusion to be drawn from all the evidence of the relationship before September 2006 and the relative silence after that time is that father and daughters were fighting and this mutual fight was prolonged and sustained by the litigation and the intervention of the mother.
This does not mean that they had withdrawn from the relationship with him unilaterally.
The high threshold for a finding that it disentitles the daughters to maintenance has not been met.","[5, 3, 9, 1, 2, 12, 18, 8, 7, 6, 17, 16]"

Counsel: William D. Delaney, for the appellant Brad G. Sarson, for the respondentReasons for judgment:[1] At the conclusion of the hearing the court announced that this appeal was allowed with reasons to follow.
These are the reasons.
[2] The Crown appeals from acquittals entered by Judge Michael Sherar of the Provincial Court on five charges relating to the possession and storage of prohibited weapons.
The Information alleged that the offences occurred on or about May 30, 2003.
[3] The charges were laid after police officers who were in attendance at a residence as a result of a fire, were advised by firefighters of the presence of two sawed off shotguns in the home.
[4] At the commencement of the trial, counsel advised the trial judge that the defence had made several admissions in a letter to the prosecutor and which was agreed would form part of the record.","The plaintiff bus driver was in a serious bus/motor vehicle accident that killed two people.
He was charged with dangerous driving.
His employer offered the services of its lawyer, who eventually transferred the file to the defendant who represented him at trial.
At trial, the Crown introduced a video of a purported accident re-enactment.
The defendant chose not to object to its admission, saying he felt it was a perfect example of the Crown's 'doomed to failure' theory.
As for the problems (it was recorded in the daytime, while the accident happened at daybreak; it assumed the vehicle that was struck was stopped, although there was no proof it was; and it didn't show all of the vehicles at the original scene), he felt these could be addressed by cross-examination.
The plaintiff was convicted.
He retained a different lawyer to represent him on appeal, and won.
Eventually, the charges were dropped.
The lawyer's competence was not raised as an issue on appeal.
In their decision, the Court of Appeal criticized him for not objecting to the admission of the video and other evidence.
They found this evidence was inadmissible, highly prejudicial and should never have been put to the jury.
The plaintiff sued in negligence and breach of contract.
The parties introduced conflicting opinions from criminal law experts to support their respective positions.
Action dismissed.
The standard of care is that of a reasonably competent lawyer.
Lawyers make strategic decisions and exercise judgment, but are not responsible to ensure a certain result.
Sometimes the decisions are wrong: it is only negligence if it was outside the realm of acceptable possibilities in the circumstances of the case.
The appeal panel had the benefit of hindsight - it is improper to judge the plaintiff's actions in light of their conclusions.
While the experts were not helpful in establishing what a reasonably competent lawyer (as opposed to a specialist in the field) would do, their differing opinions illustrate how the admissibility of evidence can be the subject of much debate.","[0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 5, 9, 8, 11, 7, 10]"
653,"These are the children of Stephanie Nicole Bourque and Christopher Thomas Lemire.
Ms. Bourque and Mr. Lemire married on October 2, 1993 and separated in or around May 5, 2002.

Justice Dellapinna ordered as follows:IT IS ORDERED THAT pending further order of this Court:a.
The parties shall share joint custody of the children, whose primary residence shall be with the Applicant, Stephanie Bourque;b.

7.","The small claims adjudicator granted an order for substituted service after the respondent had trouble serving the appellant with notice of her claim.
As per the order, she personally served the appellant's mother and notified the appellant of the hearing date by text message.
He didn't appear and default judgement was granted against the appellant in the amount of $11,031.35.
The appellant appealed, arguing the adjudicator failed to follow the natural requirements of justice.
He denied being in contact with his mother.
He admitted receiving the text message(s) but said he didn't believe the respondent, but didn't make any further inquiries.
New evidence (a letter from his mother saying she was not in contact with her son) was allowed on the appeal.
Appeal dismissed.
The right to be heard is a fundamental right, and an appeal of a default judgment must be subject to the highest scrutiny.
Here the respondent's claim was valid.
The adjudicator had the jurisdiction/authority to make an order for substituted service and the respondent followed it.
At the very least, the appellant was notified of the hearing dates by text message(s).
While he may not have believed the messages, he should have taken some steps to confirm with the court if there was indeed a hearing set.
He failed to prove he had a reasonable excuse for defaulting, chose to ignore the notice, and was mistaken only as to what would be the outcome if he failed to appear.","[6, 1, 5, 4, 9, 3, 2, 11, 10, 12, 7, 15, 8]"

Reasons for judgment:[1] The appellant was convicted of sexual assault.
He testified at trial, denying the charge, but the trial judge disbelieved his evidence.
It follows, in my view, that the conviction constitutes a miscarriage of justice and must be set aside.
II.
FACTS AND DECISION AT TRIAL:[3] The appellant appeals his conviction by Crawford, J.P.C.
on a charge of sexual assault.

The abuse consisted of touching her vagina with his hand and trying to stick his penis into her vagina.

[10] What is a misapprehension of the evidence?
(3d) 193 (Ont.

C.(J.)
C.A.)","The appellant was charged on a four count information in connection with an alleged impaired driving incident.
He contended the information was a nullity because it contravened s. 789(2) of the Criminal Code.
The Provincial Court trial judge severed the count which was the source of the difficulty.
The appellant then sought an order from the Court of Queen's Bench quashing the trial proceedings.
That application was dismissed and the appellant appealed to this Court.
At trial, the appellant made an application for an order quashing the information as being a nullity.
He contended it was drafted so as to violate the Code s. 789(2) of which states: 'No information in respect of an offence for which, by reason of previous convictions, a greater punishment may be imposed shall contain any reference to previous convictions.'
The trial judge dismissed the application to quash.
He held that the defect could be addressed in one of two ways:
The drive while disqualified charge could be amended to strike out the words 'by reason of an order pursuant to Section 253 and 254 of the Criminal Code.'
Alternatively, he said the defect could be cured if that count was severed.
The trial judge advised that he was satisfied he could fairly try the appellant even with knowledge that he had or might have a criminal record.
The appellant's application for a writ of certiorari quashing the information was dismissed by the Court of Queen's Bench.
In this Court, the appellant did not pursue his argument that the information was a nullity which should have been quashed in its entirety.
Rather, he contended that, after recognizing a problem in relation to s. 789(2) of the Code and severing count 4 of the information, the trial judge should have dealt only with that count.
More specifically, the appellants contended that an apprehension of bias arose when the judge elected to proceed on the first three counts, i.e. the charges concerning impaired driving, refusing a breath demand and obstruction.
This was said to be the case because the judge had learned of a previous conviction in the course of severing the drive while disqualified count.
HELD: The appeal is dismissed.
The test for apprehension of bias is well settled.
The leading case in the criminal context is R. v. S.(R.D.).
The test is: what would an informed person, viewing the matter realistically and practically Ã» and having thought the matter through Ã» conclude.
It is inevitable that accused persons will appear before judges who know of their criminal histories.
The community rightly trusts that such information will play no part in judicial decision making.
Accordingly, at least in the normal course, mere knowledge of an accused's criminal record does not automatically disqualify a judge from presiding at a trial.
No reasonable apprehension of bias arose by virtue of the trial judge's decision to proceed in relation to the first three counts in the information.","[2, 3, 12, 7, 11, 14, 4, 31, 13, 24, 33, 34, 5, 38, 15, 36, 8, 41, 40, 44, 18, 42, 47, 25]"
655,"There are eight counts in the indictment but the crown has withdrawn action on the remaining counts other than those that we are dealing with today.
[2] The first count the accused has pled guilty to is the number two count in the indictment.
That was accepted by the Crown and the Court.
[3] The second count is number three in the indictment, that the accused:on or about the 12th day October, A.D. 2004 at or near Aldersville in the County of Lunenburg, Province of Nova Scotia, did break and enter the dwelling house of James Eustace and did commit therein an indictable offence contrary to Section 348(1)(d) of the Criminal Code.
The previous offence also occurred at Aldersville in the County of Lunenburg.
[4] The fourth count, which is the third count to which the accused pleaded guilty, is that he:on or about the 12th day October, 2004, at or near Aldersville in the County of Lunenburg, Province of Nova Scotia, did break and enter the shed of Brian MacNutt and did commit therein an indictable offence contrary to section 348(1)(e) of the Criminal Code.

The defendant failed to make any payment.
The plaintiff applied for foreclosure on the land and an order nisi for judicial sale.
The defendant was a developer.
He argued that the foreclosure action was void because the land was being used as farmland and was subject to protection under s. 9 and 11 of The Saskatchewan Farm Land Security Act.
The other issues before the court were the appropriate period of redemption and whether the plaintiff could submit a bid that incorporated the value of the land as a 'credit' enabling the plaintiff to merely 'top up' the bid by the additional amount needed to reach the bid price.
HELD: The Saskatchewan Farm Land Security Act (SFSA) did not apply.
The undisputed evidence was that since the defendant acquired the land in 2007, their focus was to develop the land as an industrial park and they had undertaken a host of activities to achieve that purpose which clearly indicated that their intent was not to farm the land in the sense contemplated by the SFSA.
There was no foundation to deviate from the usual redemption period of 90 days from the date of the decision.
The bidding process in a judicial sale contemplates a level playing field for all participants.
The fact that the plaintiff is likely to receive a significant cash payout from the judicial sale does not modify the desirability of obliging all bidders to pay into court the full bid price.
Normal bidding rules shall apply.
The plaintiff was entitled to costs.","[1, 2, 4, 5, 6, 10, 7]"

[3] The parties separated in or around May 2001 when the Respondent, Dr. Michael Riding, moved from the matrimonial home and they were divorced in February 2003.
At the same time as their divorce was granted a Corollary Relief Judgment was also granted which incorporated the terms of an agreement signed by the parties dated January 30, 2003.
That agreement came at the end of lengthy negotiations between the parties and their counsel stretching from April 2001 to the end of January, 2003.
[4] The Agreement includes the terms of the parties’ settlement of the property division issue as well as the parties’ agreement with respect to spousal support.

He worked at the veterinary college at the University of Saskatchewan, and an employee was involved in a grievance process.
The plaintiff was involved by virtue of his supervisory position at the college.
He asserts these statements were posted on bulletin boards in the plaintiff's workplace and postings on the union website.
The statements were produced in connection with the labour grievance and alleged that the plaintiff failed to prevent harassment in the workplace in supervisory capacity or engaged in such harassment himself.
The plaintiff seeks damages and costs.
He states that he was pushed to leave his employment and is now engaged in private practice which pays less and is not as stable.
He has incurred costs to move to the United States to obtain employment.HELD:
The elements of defamation are: 1) the words would tend to lower the plaintiff's reputation in the eyes of a reasonable person, 2) the words in fact referred to the plaintiff, and 3) the words were published (Grant v. Torstar Corp.).
In these circumstances, the plaintiff was defamed.
The defendants raise the defence of absolute privilege.
This defence provides that 'no action for defamatory statements can exist where such statements are made in the course of judicial or quasi-judicial proceedings' (Getz v. Opseth).
The Trade Union Act establishes mandatory arbitration for the resolution of labour grievances and empowers the arbitration board or chairperson with court-like functions and powers.
The Saskatchewan Court of Appeal has found that an arbitration board fulfills quasi-judicial function (Fletcher Challenge Energy Canada Inc. v. Sulz).
The Court does not allow the defence of absolute privilege as it is usually considered in the context of the actual hearing before the body.
In this case, the statements were produced as a notice in order to bring further witnesses forward from the college.
The Court instead determines the statements fall within the defence of qualified privilege.
This applies in a situation where the statements are made in order to discharge the board member's duty.
The Court finds the statements were made in order to gather further evidence and witnesses, which is part of the board's duties.
The protection of qualified privilege may be removed on where there is evidence that the dominant purpose of the statements was malice.
There is no such evidence in this case, therefore the defence of qualified privilege succeeds.
Nonetheless the Court provides an opinion on damages on a provisional basis.
There was no evidence that the plaintiff was forced to leave his position and move to the United States following the incident.
The Court therefore concludes fair compensation would be $25,000.
Since the results are mixed, there is no award of costs.","[8, 7, 4, 9, 1, 3, 13, 5, 10, 22]"

At the time that Mr. Simmons was struck and injured by Mr. Colley, both individuals were on the residential property occupied by Mr. Simmons.
[2] Mr. Colley claims that he struck Mr. Simmons in self-defence.

Therefore, I have instructed myself regarding the issue of credibility relative to proof beyond a reasonable doubt in accordance with the direction found in the case of R. v. W.(D).","The accused was charged with having aftermarket tint on the side windows of his vehicle.
He appealed on other grounds.
The summary conviction appeal judge raised the issue of the sufficiency of the charge on its own motion.
The face of the ticket purported to charge the accused with an offence under s. 66(3) of The Vehicle Equipment Regulations.
HELD: The charge was declared a nullity because it was drafted so poorly that it did not give fair notice to the accused of the charge or the penalty to be imposed if breach was established.
Section 66(3) of The Vehicle Equipment Regulations purports to make displaying aftermarket tint an offence, but the section is a charging offence and does not prescribe a penalty.
The correct way to charge an accused with this offence is under s. 113 of The Traffic Safety Act which makes it an offence to operate a motor vehicle on a public highway that is not equipped in accordance with the regulations.
The count could not be amended to cure the defect because the charge was a nullity and void ab initio.

APPLICATION TO VARY SPOUSAL SUPPORT[5] The Corollary Relief Judgment (CRJ) of April 2, 2004 provides, at paragraph 8:8.
Therefore, on or before June 1, 2006, the Husband’s obligation to provide spousal support to the Wife shall terminate absolutely.
[6] Ms. Luke’s Application to Vary was filed September 21, 2006.
The spousal support order terminated prior to this date.","A class action was certificated at Queen's Bench on the basis of breaches of The Consumer Protection Act and a breach of duty of care.
The defendants were granted leave from the Court of Appeal to appeal the portion of the certification order dealing with alleged breaches of The Consumer Protection Act only.
The certification on the basis of duty of care was upheld.
As a result, a situation existed where the class action process could continue on only part of the claim until the appeal of consumer protection act issues was heard.
HELD: Rule 15 of The Court of Appeal Rules is engaged and the entire certification judgment is stayed pending the disposition of the appeal.
If the plaintiffs wish to apply to lift the stay they must do so to a judge of the Court of Appeal.","[2, 13, 10, 11, 6, 16, 7, 5, 22, 20, 9, 17, 15, 14, 18, 21, 12]"
659,"Facts[2] The relevant facts are as set out in the Crown brief:The accused himself testified that on the date in question he was parked near the Knot Pub in Lunenburg, Nova Scotia.
Prior to that he had left home at about 8:30 in the evening to meet some friends.
On the way he stopped and picked up eight cans of beer, then drove to the Car Bright car wash, where he parked.
He then walked to afriend’s home where he began to consume alcohol.
He and his friends then went to the Knot Pub where he continued to drink.
As the Pub was about to close he and his friend went to his vehicle.
He turned on the accessories to the vehicle.
He and his friends were listening to the car stereo.
He testified that he went to the vehicle to decide if he was “going to a party or walk to his girlfriend’s home”.
His vehicle was in first gear with the emergency parking brake on.
He testified that he was quite intoxicated and was too impaired to be driving.
He was found by the investigating officer .

.
behind the wheel of the vehicle in the driver’s seat.",". This was an interlocutory, discretionary decision and the chambers judge did not apply a wrong principle of law or make a clearly erroneous finding of fact, nor has there been a patent injustice.
A decision on the corollary issue of whether the proceeding should have taken place under Rule 4.07 (dismissal for want of jurisdiction) or Rule 88.02 (abuse of process) is unnecessary.","[1, 2, 7, 4, 13, 6, 14, 8, 5, 3, 10, 12, 11, 9, 15]"
660,"A Corollary Relief Judgment was issued on this same date.
[2] On August 17, 2006 Thomas Crewe signed a variation application in which he sought access with his children.
His application alleged that Lavada Crewe refused to provide access and communication with the children.
Ms. Crewe responded to that application and filed her response on September 10, 2006.
In her response she sought an immediate change to the custodial and access provisions of the Corollary Relief Judgment.
[3] On September 27, 2006 a conciliator met with these parties.
Ms. Crewe acknowledged she did not require the children to visit their father.
She did so because she was concerned about their personal safety.
They also expressed their concern about his use of marijuana to treat his condition.
In addition Mr. Crewe and Mitchell had an argument that also resulted in the boys’ decision not to visit their father.
He was prepared to agree that these access times should be arranged in accordance with the children’s wishes.
In addition she wanted:1.
Mr. Crewe’s access to take place in the presence of his mother;2.
A provision prohibiting Mr. Crewe from transporting the children at any time in his vehicle;3.
An assessment of the children’s wishes in respect to access with their father; 4.","The police responded to a call from a woman identified as the defendant's girlfriend's mother to the effect that her daughter was being abused.
Initially unable to locate the residence, they spoke to the girlfriend on the phone, who advised them that she was fine and did not require the police.
They nevertheless continued to the residence, where they heard a scream from inside.
Knowing that the defendant was a suspected drug dealer and potentially violent, they demanded entry into the home.
The daughter opened the door and told them everything was fine, there had been no assault and she had simply wanted a ride home.
From where they entered, the officers could see a person lying down in the bedroom.
They approached the man, searched him for officer safety and then conducted a warrantless search to locate any other occupants.
During the search, certain items were noted that caused them to obtain a search warrant, following which drugs were found.
The defendant's argument that the search was illegal was unsuccessful as the court found that, in these particular circumstances, the police had a responsibility to enter the home without a warrant, do a pat down search of the accused and search for other occupants.
Once drugs were seen in plain view, they proceeded to obtain a search warrant.
Judicial notice was taken of the fact that complainants in domestic situations often recant due to threats of coercion by their partners.
The defendant appealed.
Appeal allowed; conviction set aside;
although a violation of the defendant's Charter rights had occurred, the record was insufficient for this court to engage in a s. 24(2) analysis.
Although it was reasonable, in the circumstances, for the police to search for the girl, go to the defendant's home and not simply leave once she told them she was fine, the trial judge erred in failing to consider alternatives short of police entry (such as conferring with the girl after they had her step outside and close the door) and the search of the home, without a warrant.
Police authority to investigate such a call includes locating the alleged victim and determining if their assistance is required, but, without more, does not extend to the entry or search of the premises.","[1, 3, 4, 6, 7, 17, 5, 18, 8, 9, 14, 11, 19, 16, 12]"
661,"IN THE YOUTH JUSTICE COURT OF NOVA SCOTIA Citation: R. v. R.C.
2008 NSPC 12 Date: March 5, 2008 Docket: 1763716 Registry: Halifax Her Majesty the Queenv.R.C.
[2] This is a decision following a voir dire held to determine the lawfulness of the strip search of R.C.
by police, and the admissibility of 17.8 grams of crack cocaine found on the young person.
Crown and defence have agreed that the evidence heard on the voir dire is to form part of the trial proper.
It confirms many of the principles previously enunciated on the law related to warrantless searches and it sets out the parameters for strip searches.
[4] A quick summary of the principles are as follows: 1.
There is a constitutional right to privacy.
2.
Unjustified searches by the state are prohibited.
3.
Warrantless searches are prima facie unreasonable.
Search incident to arrest is an established common law exception to the rule.
Search incident to arrest does include the power to strip search, subject to limitations.
[6] The two part test in determining whether a warrantless strip search is lawful can be stated as follows: 1.
Was the strip search, carried out at the police station, conducted in a reasonable manner?","After a piece of family property was divided into two parcels, one of the brothers continued to use a driveway and maintain a garden on the other parcel.
When this brother died, his son continued to use the driveway and garden, even after the second property changed hands many times.
When the current owners of the second property refused to allow the continued use of their property, the son claimed that his use of the driveway was of right on the basis of expressed reservation or prescription.
He argued that his uncle was incompetent when he executed a statutory declaration stating that the use of both the driveway and the garden had been with his express permission.
Judgment for the defendants;
there was no express reservation of the driveway in the deed to the second property and the plaintiff did not have a prescriptive right to use the driveway.
Although the plaintiff and his father had used the driveway in a continuous, uninterrupted and peaceful manner for well in excess of 20 years, the statutory declaration showed that this use had been with the uncle's permission.","[4, 5, 0, 9, 8, 10, 12, 16, 14, 1, 11, 20, 18, 13, 23, 6]"
662,"The Cape Breton Regional Municipality (“CBRM”) interprets s. 36 as representing a commitment owed to municipalities and on this basis asserts that the Government of Nova Scotia has breached its commitment to the CBRM.
It sought a declaration to this effect from the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia.
The Court struck the claim as disclosing no reasonable cause of action.
The CBRM appeals to this Court.
Issues: 1.
What is the appropriate test for striking the CBRM’s claim?
2.
Can s. 36 represent an actionable commitment for the benefit of the CBRM?
Result: Appeal dismissed.
1.
Such claims should be struck only if they appear to be “absolutely unsustainable” or “certain to fail”.
Therefore, in the context of this appeal, the claim must survive unless the CBRM’s proposed interpretation of s. 36 offers no chance of success.

Simply put, the CBRM's claim is not sustainable because it is premised on a purported constitutional obligation which, in this context, does not exist.","The accused was a passenger in a van where the driver was stunting on the complainant's street.
The complainant was an off duty police officer who left his home and knocked on the passenger window.
The accused exited the van and assaulted the complainant resulting in the complainant receiving a broken nose and ankle.
The accused was charged with aggravated assault and assaulting a police officer.
The accused asserted a defence of self-defence to the charge of assault and questioned whether the complainant was properly identified and acting as a police officer in the line of duty at the time of the incident.
HELD: The accused was convicted of aggravated assault and acquitted of the charge of assaulting a peace officer.
1) Regardless of whether the complainant was acting in the course of his duties as a police officer, he had a lawful right to intervene to prevent the continuation of the breach of the peace he witnessed.
Even if the original actions of the accused might be viewed as originally defensive in nature, he clearly used more force than was necessary to defend himself.
 2) Although three of the Crown's witnesses identified that the complainant identified himself as a police officer, none of the versions of what occurred were consistent with the other.
The Court was left with doubt as to whether the mens rea of assaulting police officer was proven, namely that the accused knew that the officer in question was in fact a police officer.","[4, 6, 11, 2, 12, 8, 3, 9, 16, 17, 5, 18, 7, 1, 21, 33, 19, 10, 23, 13, 35]"
663,"[2] The defense have alleged a violation of the accused’s section 8 and section 9 Charter rights.
The defense have also contested the voluntariness of a statement given by the accused to the police.
The defense seek an order excluding admission of the accused’s statement to the police and exclusion of the results of the search of the accused’s person.
The motion was heard on a voir dire.
Evidence and findings of fact [3] There were three witnesses who gave evidence on the voir dire.
The facts are not in dispute.
[4] On February 6, 2008, Constable Lynch and Constable Cromwell were on foot patrol on Spring Garden Road in Halifax, Nova Scotia.
As they were walking west just beyond the Spring Garden Road courthouse, they passed the accused who was walking east on the sidewalk toward the courthouse.
The officers noted a strong smell of freshly burned cannabis marihuana coming from the accused.
They turned and, when the accused stopped outside the courthouse, the officers approached him.
There was no one else around.
Constable Lynch noted he was smoking a cigarette.
Constable Lynch asked his name and he promptly gave it.
The accused responded that it was a regular cigarette but he had just smoked a marihuana cigarette.","The accused was charged with impaired care and control of a motor vehicle and care and control of a motor vehicle while his blood alcohol level exceeded .08.
The accused was found in the driver's side of a vehicle with his legs near the pedals.
His body was slumped over into the passenger side.
The vehicle had collided with a power pole and sustained significant damage.
The engine was running when the police arrived.
There was no one else in the vehicle.
The accused was transported to hospital where the doctor suspected he had a brain bleed and recommended the police obtain a blood warrant.
The officer who swore the Information to Obtain the warrant indicated that the interior of the vehicle smelled strongly of beverage alcohol and the accused smelled of beverage alcohol.
The Justice of the Peace did not sign the Information to Obtain.
The issues before the Court were whether there had been a breach of the accused's s. 8 right to be free from unreasonable search and seizure and whether the Crown had proven beyond a reasonable doubt that the accused was in care and control of the motor vehicle.
HELD: The blood warrant was found to be invalid, meaning that the blood samples were obtained as part of a warrantless search in breach of s. 8.
The Information to Obtain the blood warrant did not depose that the officer believed the accused was the driver of the vehicle which had crashed into the power pole or that the accused was in care and control of the motor vehicle.
The officer should have included information about the accused's position in the vehicle and that the accused was unconscious.
Without this information, the Information to Obtain did not contain reasonable grounds to believe that the accused had committed an offence under s. 253 of the Criminal Code.
However, the blood sample evidence was admitted after a s. 24(2) analysis.
The Court held that the officer was acting in good faith and that he honestly held the belief that the accused was drinking and driving when he swore the Information to Obtain.
The impact on the accused was technical in nature and did not seriously undermine the accused's rights.
The Court held that the truth seeking function of the trial process would be better served by admission of the Certificate of Analysis.
The Court found that the accused was in care and control of the motor vehicle at the time of the collision.
There was no evidence that anyone else was in the vehicle and the position of the accused when discovered suggested he had been driving the vehicle.
The accused was found guilty of driving while his blood alcohol level exceeded .08.
The Court held that his blood alcohol level was between 236 mgs% and 283 mgs%.","[1, 5, 2, 4, 3, 6, 9, 7, 12, 13, 11, 10, 8, 16]"

In terms of remedy, the appellant seeks an acquittal, a new trial or a conditional discharge.
FACTUAL BACKGROUND[5] The trial did not take long.
There were only three witnesses, Professor Martin Van Bommel, Mark MacAulay and the appellant.
Much of the evidence was not contested.

The petitioner had previously been ordered to pay $1,000 in costs to the respondent but instead paid the $1,000 directly into the child's credit card balance and there was no evidence that this was done by mutual agreement between the parties.
The child was not performing well in her program with no explanation for her poor performance.
HELD The burden is on the petitioner to prove the adult child's ongoing economic dependence.
Although the child is a child within the meaning of the Divorce Act during the time she was attending classes, her expenses are excessive.
The child provided no evidence to rebut the respondent's information that she did not attend many of her classes.
The child must take greater responsibility for her own expenses and debts if she does not apply herself to her studies.
The respondent was ordered to match the amount paid by the petitioner towards the child's expenses.

In this decision I will address only the conditions relevant to Jerrell Johnston.
[4] Mr. Johnston was subject to a curfew from 8:00 p.m. to 6:30 a.m. daily, a residency requirement and a condition that he not attend certain areas in the Halifax Regional Municipality.
He was also fitted with an electronic bracelet to monitor his activities while he was on bail.

He sought a declaration pursuant to Queen's Bench Rule 664 interpreting the bylaws of the condominium corporation with respect to the voting rights of the commercial unit owners.
The condominium has 32 units with the three largest units being commercial units.
The remaining 29 units are residential.
The parties agreed that the commercial owners were entitled to nominate and vote for three positions on the Board of Directors.
A dispute arose as to whether the commercial owners were entitled to vote on the election of the positions on the Board designated for representatives of the residential unit holders.
The Board of Directors passed a resolution interpreting the bylaw such that the commercial owners were entitled to nominate up to three people for election to the Board, all owners were entitled to vote on all nominees, all the owners agreed to cast their votes so as to elect the commercial owners nominees and where that does not happen the commercial owners are entitled to vote as a class to elect their nominees and there is no restriction in the bylaw limiting the right of the commercial owners to vote on positions to the Board.
HELD The appropriate standard of review is that of reasonableness and deference must be given to the Board of Directors with regard to its interpretation of the bylaw.
There is no specific provision in the bylaws that would restrict the voting rights of the commercial owners.
Prohibiting any owner from voting altogether would be contrary to s. 41 of The Condominium Property Act because the Act provides that all owners are to vote on all questions proposed at any meeting.
The proper interpretation of the bylaws has nothing to do with the principles of contract interpretation.
The application was dismissed.
The interpretation of the bylaw by the Board of Directors was reasonable and that Court was not prepared to interfere with it.","[1, 2, 3, 7, 4, 8, 10, 6, 9, 11, 5]"

The court considered Rule 37.02(c) and distinguished between the terms 'same' and 'similar' with respect to claims involving the 'same transaction' and determined the use of the term 'same' indicated it must involve the same transaction and not merely similar transactions.
The court stated that there should be more than a single common question of law or question of fact except in the simplest of cases to grant a motion for consolidation.
The more issues and facts in common, the more supportive those factors will be toward consolidation.
The court found there was insufficient evidence of commonality between the actions and dismissed the applicants' motion for consolidation on the basis that the actions were based on similar transactions but not the same transactions.
The court did not consider the applicant's request to have the matters heard sequentially because it was raised only during their reply oral submissions to the court.

HELD: The chamber's judge was in error in striking out portions of the statement of defence and counter-claim.
The error consists of a failure to address the merits of the application.

The tenants argued that the hearing officer erred in not considering that the premises were infested with bed bugs and the tenants had been forced to incur personal expense to remedy the problem.
They sought to adduce new evidence by affidavit on this point at the appeal.
HELD: The Court declined to admit the affidavit evidence about bed bugs.
However, the matter was remitted to the hearing officer for rehearing because the reasons provided by the hearing officer were deficient.

The defendant is being sued by the plaintiff for damage caused to a construction site under a bridge in Saskatoon.
The damage is alleged to have been caused when the defendant's truck left the ramp leading onto the bridge and fell into an excavation pit.
The defendant argues that the City should be added as a third party because the City did not take proper steps to clear snow from the ramp, which provided a surface for his vehicle to launch off of.
HELD: The application to add the City of Saskatoon as a third party was granted.
The applicant has made out a prima facie case against the proposed third party.
There is no prejudice to the plaintiff because he has settled with his insurer and is requesting settlement with the defendant's insurer.

Owing to pre-trial steps taken by accused, including not re-electing trial by judge alone until Crown disclosure was thought to be complete, accused had been prejudiced.
Not appropriate to exclude highly relevant evidence.
This would frustrate truth-seeking function of court when Crown non-disclosure was inadvertent.
Mistrial would allow accused to return to “pre-prejudice’ position, while preserving the interest of Crown and public in having all relevant evidence presented at trial.

The consent judgment provided that the husband should make an equalization payment of $105,000 to be composed of cash and/or a rollover of retirement funds.
The husband wants to satisfy the judgment by paying the sum of $5,000 in cash and rolling over $100,000 in RRSPs, unreduced for tax.
Applying a 25% discount for tax, the proposal is equivalent to $80,000.
The husband argued that the consent order was not dispositive and that if the tax implications were a controlling factor they should have been specifically addressed in the judgment.HELD: The Court held that it is common practice in family property distributions to discount RRSPs to their after-tax value.
The fact that that principle was not stated explicitly in the judgment was not fatal to the application.
The evidence introduced at the hearing of the wife's position in pre-trial calculations clearly indicated that she expected the discount for tax on RRSPs.
Therefore, the Court ordered that the judgment be satisfied by way of rollover of RRSPs in the amount of $111,600.","[1, 2, 5, 3, 8, 7, 13, 6, 4, 9, 11, 10, 15, 12, 14, 16, 0]"

The debtor made a consumer proposal which was accepted by his creditors and PricewaterhouseCoopers (“PWC”) was appointed Trustee under the proposal.
At some point during the proposal Mr. White defaulted.
The Act makes it clear where the payments on a consumer proposal are to be made monthly (as was the case here), and where the debt is in default to the extent of three months of payments the proposal is deemed to be annulled.
There is no choice in this and there is no discretion in either the trustee or the court to relieve against the annulment: Re Schrader, (1999) 13 C.B.R.
4th 256 (N.S.S.C.)
I believe that PWC has reported that somewhere around April or May the debtor was three months behind in his payments.","The appellant landlord appealed a decision of the Residential Tenancies hearing officer.
The tenancy in question had commenced in April 2012.
On September 18, the tenant had given six weeks' notice of her intention to terminate the tenancy.
The term of the lease stated that it was for a term of 12 months (April 2012 to March 2013) and continuing thereafter from month to month until one of the parties gave one month's notice.
The appellant did not try to rent the premises following receipt of the notice because he had decided to furnish the unit prior to re-renting.
He spent $15,000 doing so and advertised the unit in mid-January, increasing the rent by $400 and obtained a new tenant as at February 1.
Although it is not stated what relief the landlord sought from the Office of Residential Tenancies, the hearing officer stated in the decision that the lease was a month-to-month tenancy.
The appellant argued that the hearing officer made errors in law in that he 1) misinterpreted s. 19(1)(g)(iii) of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 in making that finding, as the lease was for a fixed term; and 2) misinterpreted s. 8(2) of the Act in finding that the landlord's efforts at mitigation were not reasonable within the meaning of the section and the landlord was legally disentitled by s. 8(1) of the Act.
HELD: The Court held that the hearing officer had erred in law in finding that the lease was for a month-to-month tenancy.
The one-month-notice provision only applied if the tenancy was extended beyond the fixed term.
The appeal was allowed on this issue.
The Court found that the decision of the landlord to furnish the premises was a business decision, and the result of this decision could not be attributed to the tenant.

In these proceedings both claim title to or ownership of a certain portion of meadowland abutting the Margaree River and containing approximately six acres.
Both petitioned Mr. Justice Hugh J. MacPherson, a local Judge of the Trial Division of the Supreme Court for a certificate of title to such land under the Quieting Titles Act, R.S.N.S.
1967, c.259.
From such decision and the order based thereon the appellant appeals, contending that for the following reasons her claim to the disputed lands has been established.
(3) Alternatively, that if the respondent did have title to the disputed lands such title has been extinguished by possession thereof by herself alone and in privity with others in possession before her.
Either Angus Gillis or his two sons divided the lands, with Roderick taking the southern portion and John A.
(or Donald) the northern portion.","HELD: The Court held that the cause of the damage was high humidity in the building caused by water leaking into it from the roof.
The failure of the tenant to maintain the floor caused approximately 25 percent of the damage to the floor.
The estimated span for the flooring was 20 years.
As the lease was in good standing at present and would expire in 2018, the age of the floor at that time would be 17 years.
The Court awarded to the landlord the amount of $836, which was 25 percent of 3/20 of the damages claimed.
The business loss claimed by the tenant was $4,800.
Thus the net setoff owing by the landlord to the tenant was $4,800 less $836.

DECISION: January 29, 1990 COUNSEL: Robert Murrant, Q.C., for the plaintiff; Thomas P. Donovan, for the defendant.
ROSCOE, J.
He began his employment with Sears in September, 1954 and worked there until May, 1963 when he left on his own accord.
He resumed his employment with Sears in May, 1969 and continued until December 5, 1988 when he was dismissed without notice.
His continuous service with Sears was almost 20 years and his total period of employment was 28 years.
The defendant operates a large retail department store and catalogue sales business in Halifax.
As a driver or driver's helper, the plaintiff's responsibilities included delivery of merchandise and pick up of returned merchandise.
Each day of the week he travelled a different route.
It was also necessary to pick up goods that were being returned or exchanged by the customers and return them to the Sears warehouse.
At the end of the day, it was necessary for them to account for their receipts and items that were not able to be delivered because the customer was not at home.
The parties also agree that Mr. Taylor was, in fact, dismissed from his employment without notice, and that he was employed for an indefinite term.","The Crown did not meet the onus under s. 676(1)(a) of the Criminal Code, and therefore the appeal was dismissed.
The Appeal Court found that the Crown must satisfy the court of two things: 1) that an error of law was made on the standard of correctness; and 2) that the error had a material bearing on the acquittal.
The Court of Appeal dealt with the Crown’s arguments as follows: 1) while it is an error to mistake the elements of an offence the Court found that the trial judge did not do so.
The trial judge did, unfortunately, state that the speed needed to be proved beyond a reasonable doubt but the trial judge did not confuse the factual speed issue with either the mens rea or actus reus; 2) the trial judge thoroughly reviewed each of the witnesses’ testimony.
The trial judge did not have to refer to every piece of evidence or explain exactly how each piece of evidence was weighed or considered in the reasons; and 3) the trial judge did err in applying the criminal standard of proof beyond a reasonable doubt to the different pieces of evidence going to the vehicle’s speed.
The trial judge concluded that the minimum speed must be accepted because the higher speeds were not proven beyond a reasonable doubt.
The Court of Appeal concluded that the verdict would not have necessarily been different but for the error in law; speed was the only driving factor suggested to be dangerous.
The Crown also questioned the admissibility of the analyst’s opinion evidence on appeal, although they did not at trial.
The Crown was not allowed to raise arguments on appeal that were not raised at trial.
The analyst was originally a Crown witness at the preliminary inquiry and then he was a defence witness at trial.
Further, the Appeal Court declined to give an opinion on the weight that should have been given to the analyst’s testimony because that was a question of fact for the trial judge.","[0, 1, 10, 4, 9, 8, 3, 7, 16, 15, 21, 11, 6]"

The decision of Rogers J. is now reported in (1990), 92 N.S.R.
(2d) 254.
The material circumstances are that on June 19, 1989, Catherine McInnis, an unmarried, pregnant, 16 year old girl, applied to the Social Services Department of the City of Halifax for municipal social assistance.
Her application was based on the eligibility category for ""expectant mothers"" under Municipal Social Assistance Policy 1.2.5 (M.S.A.
Policy 1.2.5).
Her application was refused because she was under 19 years of age and was living with and being supported by her mother and stepfather.
An appeal from such refusal was dismissed by the Social Assistance Appeal Board on the ground that M.S.A.
Policy 1.2.5, although allowing for the Municipality to consider support for an unmarried mother pending birth, was not mandatory but rather discretionary.

They have extensive expenses for the care of their children and for transportation, he having to make a daily round trip of 250 km to his school.
Any surplus he might have would be minimal.
They have a reasonably frugal lifestyle.
Issue: The Attorney General did not question his good faith in past dealings with his loans.
However, it contested whether he has and will continue to experience financial difficulty so as to be unable to pay the debt.
Result: It was held that he has such financial difficulty and was granted relief.
3 - Sydney Court No.","HELD: The court found that both parties were significantly involved in the day-to-day parenting of the children such that a conclusion that one parent or the other was the primary caregiver could not be made.
The court also found that the respondent responded positively and appropriately to the petitioner’s concerns regarding masturbation and pornography.
The respondent indicated that he had not watched pornography since December 2014 and that software on his cell phone and computer provide assurances that he had not watched pornography to the petitioner.
The petitioner did not dispute that evidence.
The court could not reasonably give weight to the petitioner’s opinion evidence regarding the respondent’s alleged addictions.
The court listed numerous problems with the petitioner’s evidence of addiction.
The court was unable to conclude that there was a risk of harm to the children caused by the respondent.
With respect to the petitioner’s allegation of the respondent’s anger management problem, most of the incidents were dated.
The respondent had since taken anger management counselling, accepted that he suffers from ADD, and began taking medication for ADD.
The court held that it was in the best interests of the children to continue to reside in the family home and that it would not be in their best interests for one parent to be classified as or be the primary parent.
It was also in the children’s best interests that their parenting be shared on an equal basis.
A nesting arrangement was found to be in the best interests of the children.
The court ordered that the parties would have joint custody of the children and each party had exclusive possession of the family home when they were enjoying their assigned periods of parenting.
The parents would alternate weeks living in the family home with the children.","[1, 2, 6, 3, 5, 7, 0, 9, 10, 8, 4, 11, 13, 12, 15]"

concurring.
BATEMAN, J.A.
:Mr. Black appeals the Order of Justice Michael MacDonald of the Supreme Court dated April 30, 1996, dismissing a motion to strike the plaintiffs' (respondents') Originating Notice and Statement of Claim.
The appellant was the shareholder, chief officer and controlling mind of that company.
On August 10, 1994, Associate Chief Justice Palmeter granted an Order (issued September 7, 1994) pursuant to s. 38 of the Bankruptcy and Insolvency Act, as amended.
That Order was granted upon the motion of the respondents herein (Krupp) who sought leave of the court to initiate an action against the appellant, as is required by s. 38.
The appellant unsuccessfully applied for an Order of this court declaring the s. 38 Order, along with other Orders granted by Palmeter, A.C.J., a ""nullity"".
The decision of Pugsley, J.A., in Chambers, on this issue, is dated October 26, 1994.
The appellant by way of application purported to appeal that decision to the Chief Justice, who, by decision dated November 24, 1994, dismissed the application.
Justice Michael MacDonald was assigned to case manage that action.","The Minister of Social Services applied for an order committing a two-year-old child to the care of his maternal grandparents for an indefinite period of time.
The grandparents were previously designated as persons of sufficient interest.
The child had lived with them since birth.
The mother and father both suffered from addictions and had stopped living together by the time the child was born.
The father had multiple criminal convictions, including drinking and driving offences and weapons offences.
The mother’s relationship with her parents, family support worker and child protection worker during the course of the child’s life had been marked by volatility, argumentative behaviour and threats, one of which resulted in criminal harassment charges.
The child was the subject of a protection order, which imposed conditions upon his parents.
Neither meaningfully complied with the conditions set out in the protection order.
Both parents testified at trial that their present circumstances were not suitable to raise a child.
Each expressed intention to take steps necessary to provide a home for the child.
Each parent asserted that a temporary order was appropriate.
| HELD: The child was placed in the custody of his grandparents on an indefinite basis, which, while not temporary, was not as potentially immutable as a permanent order.
That the child was in need of protection was not seriously challenged by either his mother or father.
The prospect for change at the time of trial was limited to statements of good intentions.
On their own, such statements were insufficient.
There were opportunities for the parents to demonstrate a reasonable prospect for change.
These opportunities were squandered and, in some cases abusively rejected by the mother.","[2, 5, 0, 1, 14, 3, 12, 13, 8, 6, 10, 7, 11, 15, 17]"
686,"The complainant, Brent Andrews, is the boyfriend of another tenant Marilyn Veinot.
Findings of FactAfter hearing the evidence and on my assessment of the witnesses as they testified, I find that on January 6, 2001, the tenants invited some guests, including the complainant, for a sociable and convivial evening together.
The complainant was a regular visitor to the apartment and had heard about the fight club from Veinot.
In any event, as the evening progressed and all present were in various stages of intoxication, the accused invited the complainant to go to the basement to participate in the fight club.
The complainant willingly accepted the invitation.
On arrival in the basement, the complainant took off his shirt and squared off with the accused as if to wrestle.
However, instead of a wrestling hold, he advanced and struck the accused in the face.
Surprised and stunned, the accused put his arms around the complainant to prevent him from striking again, and, as a result, they stumbled to the floor.
In a brief struggle that followed, the accused ended on top of the complainant and commanded the situation.
However, after calming an agitated complainant and after receiving assurances of no further belligerency, he got up and allowed the complainant to stand.
The complainant hurt his knee during this contact.","HELD: The issues were determined as follows: 1) the applicant applied pursuant to The Seizure of Criminal Property Act, 2009, as that version of the Act was in place at the time of the seizure.
The respondent argued that s. 35.1 did not apply at the time of seizure, because it was not in the Act at the time of seizure.
The respondent argued that the two-year limitation period pursuant to The Limitations Act applied to the application with the date of seizure being the date of discoverability.
The respondent also argued that the 2009 Act did not have retrospective application.
The court found that the applicant applied pursuant to the 2009 Act and therefore the matter was assessed from that perspective.
Section 35.1 of the 2009 Act required applications for forfeiture to be made within two years from the director becoming satisfied that the property sought to be forfeited was proceeds of unlawful activity or an instrument of unlawful activity.
The court found that the words “Notwithstanding The Limitations Act” at the beginning of s. 35.1 served to provide an intention to prioritize the content of s. 35.1 over The Limitations Act.
An affidavit filed by the applicant indicated that the director became satisfied that the property was an instrument of unlawful activity after August 2016.
The director’s application was brought four months later, well within the two-year limitation period.
The court then considered whether the 2009 Act had retrospective application and found that B. had the same legal position and faced the same jeopardy regardless of the version of the legislation, and therefore, there was no retrospective problem;
 2) s. 7 outlined the test to apply.
The court accepted the expert’s evidence with regards to the significance of the factors evidencing drug trafficking and how common they were to the drug trafficking trade.
The applicant’s evidence also showed that the person alleging to purchase the truck from the respondent was not the purchaser and the purchase price was $8,000, not $16,000.
The court found it more likely than not that the money was proceeds of unlawful activity; and 3) B. did not provide evidence or argument to support the exception that forfeiture would clearly not be in the interests of justice.
The property was found to be proceeds of unlawful activity and the forfeiture order was granted.","[7, 5, 6, 11, 8, 10, 9, 13, 1, 4, 12]"

[15] The key evidence on the firearms possession charges are the intercepts.","HELD: The appeal from conviction was dismissed and sentence appeal allowed.
The sentence was varied to 12 months of probation.
The court found with respect to each issue that: 1) the presumption of competent trial representation had not been displaced.
The trial lawyer’s decision not to cross-examine the complainant was a tactical one.
She was very young and had difficulty expressing herself in the courtroom whereas she had given clear, coherent statements to the police shortly after the offence.
The lawyer determined that it was not beneficial to the appellant’s position to highlight those statements by raising certain inconsistences between them and the complainant’s testimony; 
2) the trial judge’s assessment of credibility was entitled to deference.
He correctly identified R v W.(D.) as the guiding legal principle in the circumstances and his credibility findings were supportable on the evidence; and 3) the sentence was unfit because denunciation and deterrence are secondary factors in sentencing young offenders and are to be considered in a fashion consistent with the principle of “diminished moral blameworthiness” described in s. 3 the YCJA.
The court acknowledged that this offence, committed against an 11-year-old and causing her serious psychological harm, might warrant a custodial sentence but for the appellant’s exemplary conduct since the offence and the almost four years that had elapsed between the offence in 2012 and his sentencing in 2016.
Under s. 3(1)(b)(iv) and (v) of the YCJA, the delay in this case offended the concept of timely justice.
To impose a custodial sentence on the appellant in this case would be contrary to the purposes of the YCJA as it would impede the appellant’s rehabilitation and reintegration into society.
The court decided that a fit sentence in this case would be 12 months of probation.","[18, 6, 30, 12, 13, 34, 35, 20, 27, 32, 41, 42, 10, 29, 33, 31, 9, 50, 19]"
688,"[3] The accused’s son was 8 years old at the time of the alleged offences.
[4] The Crown alleged that the offences occurred at the accused’s home on a night when his wife, the complainant’s mother, was at work.
It was alleged that the accused was watching pornography on the computer.
That the child came out of his bedroom, dressed in his pajamas, wanting a drink of water.
That the accused ordered his son to stand beside him and remove his pajamas.
That the boy did as he was told.
That the accused, while continuing to watch pornography, masturbated himself with one hand and with his other hand twisted his son’s penis back and forth.
[5] On July 14, 2008 the accused appeared in Court, without counsel or an interpreter and the matter was adjourned to July 31, 2008.
The Crown elected to proceed by Indictment.

In this case, the court found that the judge had not erred in his decisions regarding the first and the third requests for adjournment but had in the second request by failing to provide sufficient reasons for his denial.
Amongst many factors it considered, the court found that most importantly, the appellant had not caused his counsel to withdraw for the purpose of delaying trial.
It concluded that the error resulted in a miscarriage of justice based upon the appellant’s poor conduct of his own defence and lack of understanding of trial process.","[4, 6, 9, 8, 12, 14, 13, 15, 5, 17, 7, 18, 21, 10, 19]"

No.
The charges relate to events which occurred on April 8 and April 14, 2010 respectively.
[2] This application is brought on behalf of the accused pursuant to s.591 of the Criminal code, the relevant sections of which read as follows: s. 591(1) Subject to section 589, any number of counts for any number of offences may be joined in the same indictment, but the counts shall be distinguished in the manner shown in Form 4. .
.
.
591(3) The court may, where it is satisfied that the interests of justice so require, order(a) that the accused or defendant be tried separately on one or more of the counts.
[3] The accused seeks severance of the 21 counts in the indictment on two bases which, if granted, would require three separate trials in all.
The first proposed basis is the severance of the counts pertaining to the April 8th events from those pertaining to the April 14th events.
The second basis for the proposed severance is to separate for trial all of the so-called status offences based on a pre-existing firearm prohibition order (pertaining to the events of both April 8th and April 14th).
It is therefore incorporated by reference in this decision.
It is also clear from that decision that the burden rests upon the accused to persuade the court on a balance of probabilities that severance is in the interests of justice.","/n The accused was charged with violating s. 7(2)(b) of the Saskatchewan Fishery Regulations, 1995 by unlawfully fishing in an area of Canoe Lake, specifically Jans Bay, that had been closed to all fishing since 1993 because of overfishing by the local commercial fishery industry.
The accused, a status Indian with Aboriginal and Treaty 10 rights, was fishing for food.
He had used a net in the restricted area and had caught eight suckers, two walleye and one northern pike.
The Bay was very close to the residence of the accused on the Canoe Lake First Nation and was his preferred area to fish.
The remainder of Canoe Lake was subject to restrictions governing all fishing but open to unlimited Treaty sustenance fishing all year round.
The accused admitted to the actus reus of the offence.
Under the Constitutional Questions Act, 2012 the accused gave notice that he would argue that s. 7(2)(b) of the regulations was invalid because it restricted his Treaty and Aboriginal right to fish food in the restricted area as defined by the Regulations; infringed his Treaty and Aboriginal right to fish for food as protected by s. 35(1) of the Constitution Act, 1982; and infringed his Treaty and Aboriginal right to fish for food as protected by s. 25 of the Charter of Rights.
The agreed Statement of Facts confirmed the accused’s Aboriginal Treaty status and right to sustenance fishing.
The Crown’s major witness was an expert in fish biology and he testified that the restricted area had been closed to protect it for walleye spawning.
He stated that the closed area could not be opened for sustenance fishing.
The conservation effort had been supported by the Canoe Lake Band Council./n
HELD: The accused was found guilty.
The court found that the accused had failed to show a breach of his Treaty fishing right that would raise a defence or a Charter remedy to the charge against him: 1) the challenged regulations were within the implied common law limitations on Aboriginal fishing rights; 2) alternatively, the regulations fell within the provisions that permitted such regulations in Treaty 10; 3) alternatively, if they were not within the implied limitations of the right, the evidence had not established a prima facie infringement of the right; 4) alternatively, if there was a breach, it met the justification principles set out in Sparrow and Pierone.","[0, 3, 8, 7, 1, 9, 5, 10, 12, 6, 15, 4]"

For such offence, the appellant was sentenced to eight years imprisonment.
He now applies for leave to appeal and, if leave is granted, appeals against both conviction and sentence.
The material facts are as follows.
The complainant is the divorced mother of two teenage children with whom she resided at all material times in an apartment in the [name of location changed] area.
The complainant's former boyfriend remained in her apartment to babysit her children.
The complainant remained in the [name of place changed] playing darts until approximately 7:00 o'clock in the evening.
That particular branch of the [name of place changed] was about one‑half mile from the complainant's residence.
During the course of the evening the complainant met the appellant with whom she was not previously acquainted.","HELD: The accused were each acquitted of all charges.
The court believed the evidence provided by the two accused and found that it was possible that the lease represented the actual arrangement between them and O.G. and that they believed that there only 400 plants in the greenhouses and they were part of a legal grow operation.
The letter provided by O.G. purporting to change the address of his licences was found to have been forged by him.
Regarding the possession for the purpose of trafficking, the court found that it was not satisfied on the evidence that either of the accused ever had personal possession or control of the marijuana plants nor that they had joint or constructive possession by virtue of some arrangement with O.G.
The accused had explained that the cash seized by the police from their house had been received by them after they sold a trailer.","[1, 0, 2, 6, 3, 4, 7, 12, 8, 10, 14, 19, 13, 18, 15, 23, 27]"
691,"Summary: The parties were married in November 1993.
They had two children, aged 12 and 7.
They separated in October 2004 and were divorced in March 2007.
Their Corollary Relief Judgment incorporated an agreement that the parties would share joint custody of the children and share parenting of the children approximately equally.
The parties also agreed that child support would be based on the difference between what the husband would otherwise pay to the wife for the support of the two children and what the wife would otherwise pay to the husband if the shared custody arrangement did not exist.
Because of the significant discrepancies in their income, the husband agreed to pay to the wife $1,268.00 per month in child support.
In November 2006 the former wife applied to vary child support.
Because of the husband’s increased income, the child support, based on the same formula, was increased $1,506.00 per month.
The former wife now seeks to again increase the level of child support based on the former husband’s increased income and a decline in her income.
However, in each of the four years prior to the application she had withdrawn from her RRSP between $10,000 and $14,000.
She argued that her RRSP income should not be considered when calculating her contribution to the support of the children.","HELD: The court sentenced the accused to a global sentence of 10 years for the manslaughter conviction.
A one-year concurrent sentence was imposed for the conviction of prohibited possession of a firearm.
The court gave him credit at the rate of 1:1.5 for his time on remand, resulting in a net global sentence of six years, five months to be served in a federal penitentiary.
The Gladue report was considered and the background of the accused was assessed as an enormous mitigating factor.
The court found that this was not an appropriate case to make an order pursuant to s. 743.6 of the Code both because of the multiple Gladue factors and because it had addressed the principles of denunciation and deterrence in the global sentence.","[7, 1, 4, 6, 9, 8, 2, 5, 12, 3, 11]"

The husband requested sole custody with the children in the wife’s care every second weekend.

The applicant had been charged with the first degree murder of her estranged husband.
The judge at preliminary inquiry concluded that there was evidence adduced that the accused had paid money to the man who had killed the victim the day after the killing, that she was involved in cleaning the apartment where the killing took place after the body was removed, and that the accused and the man who killed the victim had discussed the matter prior to the event, and thus there was sufficient evidence upon which a 'properly instructed jury may find...[the accused] guilty...'
The appellant contended that the judge had applied the wrong test for committal.
Dismissing the application,
that the question is not whether the judge correctly verbalized the test, but rather if the evidence supported the committal, and there was, indeed, enough circumstantial evidence upon which a jury, properly instructed and acting reasonably in accordance with those instructions, could convict the accused of first degree murder.","[4, 2, 9, 3, 5, 12, 10, 6, 7, 18, 16, 24, 19, 25, 13, 8, 1]"
697,"Christie Ezurike (the Petitioner) and Levi Ezurike (the Respondent) were married on October 15, 1986 in Nigeria.
They separated on October 18, 2004 after which the Petitioner petitioned for divorce and the Respondent filed a Counter-Petition.
[2] The parties have four children.
At the present time the two older children reside with their mother when they are not attending university and the two younger children live the majority of the time with their father.
The parties are unable to agree on the ongoing custodial arrangements with respect to the two younger children.
They have also not agreed on the division of their assets and debts or on the issue of child support.
BACKGROUND[3] The parties met in Nigeria on October 7, 1986.
It was the first marriage for the Petitioner and the second for the Respondent.
The Respondent has three children from his first marriage.
He is older than the Petitioner by approximately twenty-four years.
She was twenty-two on the date of their marriage and he was forty-six.
[4] After their marriage the parties moved to Canada where the Respondent had been living for many years.
The Respondent provided financially for the family and the Petitioner maintained their home and cared for the children.","This was an appeal of a Municipal Board decision which overturned city council's refusal to allow the respondent's application to vary the height restriction on a proposed project.

They have two children: Maclean, now aged 11, and Kaylee, now aged 9.
The parties entered into a Separation Agreement dated August 23, 2000 which was incorporated into a Corollary Relief Judgment on May 16, 2001.
[2] The following three paragraphs of the Corollary Relief Judgment are most relevant to this application:CUSTODY AND ACCESS7.
(a) The Husband and the Wife shall have shared, joint custody, care and control of the Children of the Marriage.
Each of the Husband and the Wife shall have the day-to-day care and control of each of the Children of the Marriage while each of the Children of the Marriage is in his or her care.
(b) The Children of the Marriage shall spend equal amounts of time with the Husband and the Wife.
The Husband and the Wife shall be flexible in attempting to determine the specific equal residency arrangements which are in the best interests of the Children of the Marriage.
However, the Husband and the Wife may mutually agree upon alternative equal residency arrangements for the Children of the Marriage.
[3] The evidence disclosed that this is a high conflict couple and it is doubtful their parenting arrangements had any real chance of success.","This was an appeal of a decision which denied variation of a maintenance award where a lump sum had been previously ordered.
The judge determined that since the respondent had paid the lump sum, his obligations were terminated; therefore, the Family Court did not have jurisdiction to hear the application.
Allowing the appeal and returning the matter to the Family Court,
that orders for child support made under the Family Maintenance Act do not have the finality which they did under other previous legislation.
The order is always subject to variation in appropriate circumstances.
Accordingly, the Family Court has jurisdiction to vary awards of lump sum child support made pursuant to the Family Maintenance Act.","[1, 4, 5, 7, 2, 6, 8, 3, 10, 13]"

:This is an appeal by the Minister of Finance under the Health Services Tax Act.
The Sarah Kate, a sailing vessel, was purchased by the respondent, John Risley in Finland in 1988.
The vessel sailed to the Carribean where it remained until May of 1989.
From May to October, 1989, the vessel was based in Camden, Maine.
In July, 1989, the vessel was in Halifax at the end of the Marblehead race.
On both occasions the vessel was allowed into Canada under a customs permit.
No customs or excise tax was paid.
In the fall it went to the Carribean for the winter.
Notice of objection to the assessment was filed and eventually the matter came before the N.S.","The parties lived together for 14 years and had three children, aged eight, 13 and 14.
The petitioner always worked and eventually became a successful stockbroker.
The respondent was employed part-time doing minimum wage jobs and was responsible for the household duties and raising their children.
The petitioner's annual income was $50,000 at the time of separation, but escalated to $200,000 in 1992 and was prone to great fluctuation.
The respondent was to have custody of the children.
She sought spousal and child support and an unequal division of assets.
Ordering support and an unequal division of assets.
The court extensively reviewed the case of Moge v. Moge (1992), 43 R.F.L.(3d) 345 (S.C.C.) and found that marriage and child care responsibilities hinder a wife's role in the workplace.
The court awarded $4500 per month as spousal and child support, plus an additional $500 while the wife retrained.
The court considered this an appropriate case for an unequal division of matrimonial assets in the respondent's favour.
Finding that the awards were still not sufficient to satisfy the respondent's needs, a lump sum award of $18,000 was ordered.

:This is an appeal from refusal of certiorari and other relief by Madam Justice E.A.
Roscoe following findings by a disciplinary panel that the appellant had broken rules by which the investment dealers' profession regulates itself.
The appellant is Donald F. Ripley, who at material times was the regional manager, vice‑president and a director of McLeod Young Weir, investment dealers.
Two other charges, numbered (i) and (iii), were dismissed on grounds that they fell within the responsibilities of the branch manager.
In his vigorous counter attack Mr. Ripley has denied the involvement alleged in the first charge and asserted that he is not the officer who should be held responsible on the remaining three.
Much of his argument has been directed at the process by which he was found guilty.
We further accept the evidence of Frank and Kathy Nichols and Cynthia Hallett where their testimony conflicts with that of Mr. Ripley.
That finding is well within the duty and jurisdiction of a disciplinary board.
It is devastating to Mr. Ripley's defence to charge (ii).","The solicitor for the plaintiff union had been a partner of the law firm which incorporated the defendant company and was under a general retainer to them.
Several of the defendants made application to have the plaintiff s solicitor removed as solicitor of record claiming this was a conflict of interest.
Dismissing the application,
that the test in such circumstances is whether the public represented by the reasonably informed person would be satisfied that no use of confidential information would occur.
To do so it must be shown that a solicitor client relationship existed.
There must not be a danger of the confidential information coming back to haunt the client.
The court found that such a relationship did not exist in this instance.
In addition, the applicant must demonstrate that the solicitor received information which is relevant to the matter at hand.
The court found no such evidence of this possibility.
It is no bar to representation by a solicitor that some former partners at a previous firm will be examined for discovery or called to testify.","[7, 6, 2, 5, 0, 1, 12, 20, 8, 21, 19, 17, 16]"

:This is an appeal from conviction for carrying a concealed weapon, a push dagger, contrary to Section 89(a) of the Criminal Code.
It is clear from the remarks of the learned trial judge that he did not consider the definition of weapon as set out in Section 2 of the Criminal Code.
He founded the conviction solely on the basis the push dagger was concealed on the accused person.
This case was tried before the Appeal Division handed down its decision on November 14, 1990, in R. v. Roberts in which the Court interpreted the 1985 definition of weapon as contained in Section 2 of the Criminal Code.
That is a question for the trial judge.","The Plaintiff rented a paint sprayer from the Defendant.
He accidentally injected one of his fingers with paint.
The finger had to be amputated.
He commenced these proceedings against the Defendant seeking damages for a failure to warn him of the danger associated with the use of the paint sprayer.
HELD: Judgment for the Plaintiff.
 1)The paint sprayer was of the 'airless' type.
It operated at 2,500 lbs. pressure.
This would not have been appreciated by the ordinarily prudent user.
The Defendant therefore had a duty to warn.
2)The Defendant could not escape liability because the sprayer had been rented from a location owned and operated by an independent contractor.
Where an enterprise or activity is inherently dangerous, the duty to warn can not be delegated.
In such a situation the party who retains the independent contractor remains vicariously liable.
3)The waiver in the rental contract was ineffective.
It was a standard form agreement signed on its face with the terms of the contract on the reverse.
4)The Plaintiff was awarded general damages of $10,000.00, $5,000.00 for loss of earning capacity and recovered $3,789.50 for SHSP.
5)The usual increase in general damages for inflation and pre-judgment interest were both reduced because the Plaintiff had not presecuted his action expeditiously.","[1, 0, 2, 4, 3, 6, 5, 7, 8, 9, 10, 14]"

The facts are not in dispute.

The appellant is the landlord, the respondents the tenants.
The appellant increased the rent to $515.00 on May 1, 1989, which increase was somewhat reluctantly accepted by the respondents.
However, on January 30, 1990, that is approximately one month prior to the expiration of the lease, the appellant gave to the respondents notice of increase in rent to $580.00 per month, to be effective May 1, 1990.
The appellant offered to permit the respondents to terminate the renewed release on three months notice during the term of the lease if they were unhappy with the rental increase.","The applicant sought a declaration that the province was responsible for providing school buildings for delivery of the public school program and that when buildings must be leased, the province bore the associated costs.

Every one commits robbery who ...(d) steals from any person while armed with an offensive weapon or imitation thereof.
The maximum penalty is imprisonment for life (s. 344).
The second offence, generally called unlawful use and possession of a firearm, was contrary to s. 85(1)(a) of the Code which provides:85.
The minimum penalty in the case of a first offence is not less than one year and the maximum is not more than fourteen years (s. 85(1)(c)).
The circumstances arose from an armed robbery at a store at Halifax.","The accused was charged with sexual assault and was tried in the Court of Queen's Bench.

This is an appeal from a decision of Richard, J. declaring that the respondent Guardian was not liable to contribute to payment of a fire loss that was insured against by the appellant Hartford.
The Province of Nova Scotia had entered into a contract with Fraser‑Brace for the construction of a hospital.
The contract allocated the risk for fire loss to Fraser‑Brace and required Fraser‑Brace to obtain fire insurance to protect the parties against fire loss.
Hartford issued a builder's risk policy to Fraser‑Brace; such a policy includes coverage for loss caused by fire.
The cover was just over $27,000,000.00.
Fraser‑Brace contracted the electrical work to Delta; there was no requirement that Delta obtain fire insurance but due to a misunderstanding by Delta it obtained a builder's risk policy from Guardian.
The named insured was Delta with loss, if any, payable to the Province.","The Plaintiff applied for payment out of certain monies paid into court in response to 3 garnishee summons served on 2 garnishees after judgment.

1)The court has an inherent power to control its own process in garnishment proceedings.
2)The court also has the discretion to order the payment of the money to the plaintiff as a judgment creditor.
3)The chambers judge ordered that the monies held in court to the credit of this cause be paid to the plaintiff, but made no order as to costs.","[0, 1, 4, 6, 5, 3, 7, 9, 8, 10, 11, 14, 12]"

Police officer without holding a voir dire.
The constable made notes of a conversation he had with the appellant respecting some of the circumstances surrounding the offence.
The trial judge agreed with the submission of Crown counsel that the conversation should not be admitted into evidence because of an alleged inducement.","The plaintiff held a mortgage on a house destroyed by a suspicious fire.

:This is an appeal from a corollary relief judgment of Mr. Justice Richard dividing matrimonial assets and from an order for support of the children of the marriage, with respect to its effective commencement date.
Mr. Justice Richard divided the matrimonial assets equally.
The appellant, the husband, contends that he should have included in those assets a money manager bank account.
The account was in the wife's name alone and was valued at $5,961.20 at the time of separation.
By the time of trial, this balance was reduced to approximately $100.00.
The wife's testimony was ‑that when she went back to work, the marriage was in difficulty and that it was unlikely that the parties would be staying together.","Fulltext of judgment follows:
After careful consideration, I would prefer to adjourn the discharge hearing for a period of 6 months.
This would allow the Court to assess the financial circumstances of the bankrupt and her spouse at that time.
The objecting creditor will be responsible for arranging a date for the discharge hearing to reconvene sometime in September or October, 1996.","[0, 1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 7, 4, 9, 8, 10, 11, 12, 13]"

:The primary issue in this appeal is whether certain conversations the trial judge had with counsel during the course of a trial create an apprehension or perception of bias, as that term is used in the law.
Briefly stated, the facts relative to the issue are these.
This case concerned a custody application in the Family Court involving two infant children.
In due time the Administrator of Family and Children's Services in the province of Nova Scotia, acting pursuant to the Children's Services Act, then S.N.S.
Before the judge at trial were parties with competing interests.
All three parties were represented by their own counsel.","The respondents were granted an order by a Chambers judge pursuant to s. 38(1) of the Bankruptcy Act which authorized them to commence a fraud action against the appellant, a bankrupt.
In making his ruling, the Chambers judge found that the respondents were creditors of the bankrupt estate for the purposes of s. 38(1).
The respondents subsequently commenced an action against the appellant.
The appellant applied to the judge assigned to oversee the case management of the action for an order striking the Statement of Claim on the basis that the respondents were not creditors of the bankrupt estate and, therefore, should not have been granted the order authorizing the commencement of the action.
The case management judge held that he did not have the jurisdiction to inquire into the merit of the s. 38 order.
He dismissed the action.
The appellant appealed.
Dismissing the appeal with costs,
that the case management judge did not err.
The appellant could not collaterally attack the s. 38 order by challenging a factual finding made in the granting of the order.","[3, 2, 0, 6, 1, 5, 4, 10, 8, 11, 16, 12, 14, 15, 21, 17, 7, 25, 19]"

CHIPMAN, J.A.
:The appellant Prenor is a mortgagee which unsuccessfully sought a deficiency judgment against the respondent, Bezanson, a guarantor of the covenants of a mortgage given by Seawood Enterprises Ltd. to Prenor.
The mortgage dated December 31, 1987 was for $400,000 given on the security of property which had been appraised at $538,000.
The mortgage fell into arrears and Prenor commenced foreclosure proceedings on August 2, 1990 against Seawood, the respondent and one Claes, another guarantor.
The statement of claim, to which no defence was filed, specifically claimed a deficiency judgment against all three defendants.
On Prenor's application, an order for foreclosure and sale was granted on August 23, 1990 and the sheriff's sale took place on October 2, 1990.","This was an application by the defendants to set aside a default judgment entered against them by the plaintiff.
Although a statement of claim was served on the defendant, it's insurer was advised by the plaintiff's counsel that she would not proceed to judgment except on 10 days written notice.
More than six months later plaintiff's counsel sent a letter to the defendant's insurer giving 10 days notice.
This letter was not seen by him although he was in the process of putting together material for a solicitor to file a defence.
The defendant had always advised the plaintiff that it intended to defend.
No Notice of Intention, required for default judgment if six or more months had elapsed since the last step in the proceeding, was ever given to the defendant before the filing of the default judgment.
Allowing the application and setting aside the default judgment,
that there was a fairly arguable defence and a reasonable excuse on the part of the defendant for not filing the defence.
Sending a letter to the insurer does not satisfy the requirement of filing a Notice of Intention to proceed.
The fact that the prothonotary did not object to the request for default judgment without the Notice is immaterial.","[2, 0, 1, 3, 5, 6, 7, 4, 8, 9, 10, 12, 11, 13]"

:The respondent pled guilty to a charge that on October 21, 1992, at Lower Sackville he stole a sum of money from Angela Murray when armed with an offensive weapon, a tire iron, contrary to s. 344 of the Code.
On October 23, 1992 his sentence was suspended for three years.
A probation order was imposed.
The Crown now seeks leave to appeal and if that be granted, appeals from that sentence.
In suspending sentence the trial judge said:""Mr. Emmerson, I am going to suspend sentence.","The appellant appealed his sentence of five months in prison to be followed by 18 months probation following his plea of guilty to the theft of his grandmother's car.
Crown counsel acknowledged that this type of case would generally attract a suspended sentence with probation but for negative information in the pre-sentence report, which the appellant had not seen prior to sentencing.
The appellant argued that he had seen the errors of his ways, was seeking employment, was truly remorseful, and had apologized to his grandparents, who were paying for the appeal in the hope of keeping him out of jail.
The appellant was allowed to file affidavits as to the his progress concerning his problems with drugs and alcohol.
Per Pugsley, J.A., Flinn, J.A. concurring, allowing the appeal and ordering a suspended sentence subject to terms,
that the sentence imposed was not fit, and that it was not in society's interest that the appellant should be removed form his present positive environment.
Per Bateman, J.A., dissenting, that the affidavits filed on behalf of the appellant were lacking in probative value.
It is left, then, to determine the fitness of the sentence at the time it was made.

HALLETT, J.A.
This application to adduce evidence on appeal arises on an appeal from an order of the Family Court dismissing the appellant's application to terminate a permanent custody order respecting her son who had been taken into care by the Children's Aid Society shortly after his birth.
The request that this court receive evidence on the appeal is made pursuant to s. 49(5) of the Children and Family Services Act, R.S.N.S.
1990, Chapter 5 and Civil Procedure Rule 62.22 which is the general rule governing the reception of evidence on the hearing of an appeal.
Section 49(5) of the Act provides:A49(5) On an appeal pursuant to this Section, the Appeal Division of the Supreme Court may in its discretion receive further evidence relating to events after the appealed order.""","Issues included the division of a pension, child and spousal support and whether to transfer or have sold the matrimonial home which had a small equity.
The petitioner was an undischarged bankrupt and any funds in his possession belonged to the trustee.
The only marital asset of any value was the petitioner's pension but lump sum payment was not available for five years as there was a liquidity problem.
The parties had been 'spenders' not 'savers'.
HELD: 1)The respondent was to pay child support for one child.
2)Spousal support was denied.
3)The matrimonial home was to be sold and proceeds were to be divided equally.
 4)Three values were suggested for valuation and distribution of the pension plan.
The retirement method of calculating the value of the pension yields the fairest value as opposed to the termination method.
The practice by the plan administrator on marriage breakdown was to divide the pension on the basis of the commuted value only and excess contributions were not considered for the purpose of the lump sum transfer to a locked in spousal RRSP.
The options were to leave the funds in the plan and defer payment until age 65 or have the commuted value transferred to a locked-in RRSP.
The respondent was to make the choice between the only two options.
If she wished to have the funds in her name immediately, she was to provide written notification otherwise there would be an order that the respondent is to receive a portion when the monthly pension benefit commences.","[0, 2, 1, 3, 6, 4, 7, 8, 5, 10, 11, 12, 9]"

Publishers of this case please take note that s.38(1) of the Young Offenders Act applies and may require editing of this judgment or its heading before publication.
PUGSLEY, J.A:This is an appeal by the young offender who was convicted of nine charges of break and enter and one charge of assault.
He submits that the Youth Court judge erred in law, in concluding that the statements taken from him by the R.C.M.P.
on March 3, 1992 were voluntary statements, and erred, as well, in finding that the statements had been taken in compliance with the provisions of s. 56 of the Young Offenders Act.
Detachment attended at the trailer and took the appellant into custody.
The appellant was placed under arrest for break and enter on the previous evening into the office of a local lawyer.
The appellant was given his rights to counsel, as well as a police warning.","FIAT. An application to disqualify and remove a solicitor and law firm from acting for the petitioner.
Steps were not taken to ensure that no disclosure of information would occur for a month after the firm was put on notice.
At issue was whether the screening measures taken ensured that no disclosure would occur and satisfied the evidentiary burden imposed on the law firm.
HELD: The solicitor and the law firm were disqualified from acting for the petitioner in the action.
Because two years had lapsed further examinations were appropriate and an order issued for the petitioner to attend a further examination.
If the updated information is not necessary for trial the petitioner may request costs at that time.
The application for an order with respect to without prejudice offers of settlement was dismissed as matters of evidence were to be determined by the trial judge.
 1)Since the decision in Martin v. Gray the Law Society amended the code of conduct to provide for rules where a member transfers from one law firm to another.
2)The difficulty in this case was that no measures were taken prior to or at the time the solicitor joined the firm to ensure confidentiality.
The time period before taking appropriate steps was completely inadequate.
 3)The second question, whether there was a risk that the confidential information will be used to the prejudice of the client, Martin v. Gray stated that once the presumption arises and is not rebutted, the lawyer's disqualification is automatic and no assurances or undertakings not to use the information will avail. 4)The respondent was awarded the costs of the motion fixed at $300.","[1, 0, 5, 2, 3, 4, 7, 10, 11, 8, 12, 17, 19, 18]"

:The appellant pled guilty in Provincial Court to three charges of dangerous driving causing bodily harm.
He sought leave to appeal and appeals from his sentence of nine months incarceration plus two years probation on each charge, to be served concurrently.
On June 9, 1994 at about 10:00 p.m., the appellant had an argument with his girlfriend at her home on Connolly Street in Halifax.
He left the home in an agitated state, got into his vehicle and drove northerly on Connolly Street at a high rate of speed, with his headlights off.
These three people suffered serious injuries.
At the time of the accident, the appellant had not consumed alcohol or drugs.
The appellant is 19 years of age and has a grade 12 education.","A Director was charged with professional misconduct for coercing the resignation of two principals in his school division.
The Discipline Committee found the appellant guilty of misrepresenting the school process report involving the first principal and of threatening the other principal that if he did not apply for a transfer and resign the matter would be dealt with at the board table and that 'it could get ugly'.
The Executive Committee of LEADS issued a reprimand to be placed on his file for five years and a fine of $2,500.
At issue was whether the Discipline Committee erred in its findings of fact and the burden of proof, whether the facts, if true, constituted professional misconduct and whether the penalty imposed was excessive.
HELD: Appeal dismissed.
 1)The legislation does not appear to call for a change in the traditional approach.
The fact that an appellate judge can substitute his or her decision for that of the Discipline Committee or order of an executive does not mean that the appellate court's view of the facts and credibility of witnesses supercedes in any way the role of the Discipline Committee unless it finds there were inappropriate inferences drawn, conclusions reached which were not supported by the evidence, or a misdirection on a point of law.
None were found in either case.
The Discipline Committee did not err in its interpretation of 'professional misconduct' or its application to the facts.
 2)Section 52 of the LEADS Act and s62 of the Medical Profession Act, 1981 are virtually the same except for minor changes in wording and format.
The jurisprudence under the Medical Profession Act was applicable to the standard of review in this case.
3)The penalty imposed was not wrong or unjustified.
Section 47 of the LEADS Act gives the Executive Committee wide latitude in the nature of punishment that it may impose upon a person found guilty of professional misconduct.
The Executive is not bound by the recommendations of the Discipline Committee.
They are only guidelines. 4)The Act is silent as to who shall bear costs of providing the documents filed pursuant to s51(2) of the Act.
If the legislature had intended the statutorily mandated costs to be costs in the cause it would have said so. LEADS should bear the costs in this case.
In any event pursuant to the court's inherent jurisdiction and pursuant to s52 of the Act the costs of providing the materials were to be borne by the respondent. 5)Subject to the above the respondent was entitled to costs of and incidental to the appeal.ADDENDUM to TWL QB96220.
The concluding paragraph was amended to read: Subject to what has been stated in the immediately preceding paragraph hereof, the respondent will be entitled to recover its costs of, and incidental to this appeal, from the appellant, to be taxed on Column 3.","[2, 0, 1, 3, 5, 8, 6, 7, 9, 10, 4, 14, 16, 11, 18]"

The parties were divorced.
The appellant appealed to this Court in 1993 from a decision of Mr. Justice Boudreau dividing property between them as separated spouses pursuant to the Matrimonial Property Act.
This Court allowed the wife's appeal in part holding among other things that the judge erred in ruling inadmissible certain evidence about the value of scallop licenses.
This Court found it impossible to value the fishing licenses of the respondent as there was no reliable evidence of their value.
This Court remitted the matter to the Supreme Court for determination on evidence to be adduced by the parties of the value inter alia of the fishing licenses and boats of the respondent.","FIAT. The applicant sought an order pursuant to s. 159(3) of the Land Titles Act to continue caveats until further court order or until withdrawn.
The respondent had served notice to lapse all of the caveats which were based on an agreement taken by Freeholders Oil from the registered owner of the minerals.
The respondent sought an order directing the caveats be continued on the condition Home Oil commence an action within a reasonable time to determine their validity.
At issue was whether the caveator or the challenger should be required to initiate an action.
HELD: The caveats were to be continued until a further court order was filed in the Land Titles Office or until they were withdrawn.
1) Each of the agreements was prima facie still in existence as there had been no cancellation or rescission of the agreements and Home Oil was the valid successor of the interest of Freeholders.
2) Further documentation would be required by a trial judge to determine the issue of the validity of Home Oil's interest in the leases including whether Home Oil's lease violated the rule against perpetuities.
 3) Home Oil was given its costs of the application.","[2, 0, 1, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 7, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14]"

was found guilty on two counts of indecent assault against S.S. and B.J.R.
between January 1, 1973 and December 31, 1977.
These assaults took place in a trailer where the two girls, at the time, were living with their mother who was in a common‑law relationship with G.A.L..
The assaults consisted of repeated fondling of the breasts and vagina of B.J.R.
when she was between 13 and 16 years old.","FIAT. The mother sought to have the ongoing child support of $180 per month per child for the three children of the marriage increased.
The last three income tax returns of the father indicated an average gross income of $28,000 after adjustments.
His net worth had increased substantially since the original order in 1993 from a net worth of $105,744 after deducting debts of $352,655 to $484,684 after deducting debts of $342,000.
He purchased stock totalling $202,061 in 1996 using income generated from the farm.
He claimed he could not work full time in the oil field because he was involved in a bison operation.
HELD: The respondent was to pay monthly child support of $957 for as long as the children remained children as defined by the Divorce Act.

:This is an application for leave to appeal from a decision of Mr. Justice MacLellan in the Supreme Court dismissing an appeal from the appellant's conviction under s. 253(b) of the Criminal Code.
The Crown adduced evidence before Judge Clyde F. MacDonald in Provincial Court of breathalyzer readings of 110 and 120 milligrams.
The appellant testified that he had consumed five pints of beer during the course of the afternoon, the last shortly before being stopped by the police.
The main issue on this appeal is the application of the decision of the Supreme Court of Canada in St. Pierre v. The Queen (1995), 1995 CanLII 135 (SCC), 96 C.C.C.
(3d) 385 (S.C.C.).

The applicant sought an order pursuant to s63 of the Personal Property Security Act (PPSA) declaring that the agreement between the parties was a security agreement within the definition of the Personal Property Security Act rather than a lease and that the respondent was limited to a lien pursuant to s18 of the Limitation of Civil Rights Act; and an order that funds paid into court pursuant to a pre-judgment garnishee summons be returned to the applicant.
The respondent seized the vehicle and issued a statement of claim for $5,330.81 as arrears of lease payments.
The applicant had made payments for several months and acknowledged that she was in default on the payments for the tractor-trailer unit but contended the agreement was not a lease and that the respondent, having repossessed the collateral, was not now entitled to claim any additional payments.
HELD: The application was dismissed.
Costs in the cause.
1)The relief sought did not fall within any of the wording of s63(2) of the Personal Property Security Act and therefore there was no jurisdiction to grant the relief requested.
The application was simply an attempt to end run the action commenced by the respondent.
2)The applicant was not seeking to remedy a wrong with respect to the seizure or preservation of the collateral but was seeking a remedy pursuant to the Limitations of Civil Rights Act.
The proper forum was to have the issues determined in the action commenced by the respondent.","[2, 0, 3, 1, 8, 4, 6, 5, 9, 7, 10, 11, 14, 13, 12]"

(Orally): [1] This appeal is from a decision of Justice Hamilton of the Supreme Court in an assessment of damages arising out of an automobile accident.
The respondent admitted liability for driving his truck into the back of the appellant’s motor vehicle.
The trial judge described the accident as “a very mild rear end collision.”[2] At the heart of this appeal is the finding of the trial judge that the accident in question did not contribute materially to the appellant’s present poor health, and that the accident caused only a mild aggravation of the appellant’s pre-existing, and major, back problem.
The trial judge found the appellant’s evidence to be lacking in credibility.
The medical evidence, she determined, did not support the appellant’s position that there is no other reason for his present medical problems but the accident in question.
Accordingly, I award him $25,000.00 general damages for general pain and suffering.","This was an action for wrongful dismissal.
The plaintiff went on maternity leave for six months.
During this time the defendant, her employer, hired a temporary replacement on a part-time basis, with fewer hours and less pay than the plaintiff.
The defendant offered this position to the plaintiff when her leave had ended.
She refused, and alleged constructive dismissal without cause.
She admitted that the defendant had asked her prior to her leave if her job could be done in less hours, and that she said it might be possible.
The defendant alleged that this should have made it clear to the plaintiff that her position was being changed from full-time to permanent part-time, and constituted reasonable notice.
Awarding the plaintiff eight month's notice,

2364 PROVINCE OF NOVA SCOTIAIN THE SUPREME COURT OF NOVA SCOTIA TRIAL DIVISION BETWEEN: FARM CREDIT CORPORATION, a body corporatePlaintiff ‑ and ‑ W. BRUCE GILLIS, Barrister and SolicitorDefendant Richard, J.
(orally):This is an action by Farm Credit Corporation (FCC) against the defendant, W. Bruce Gillis, a barrister and solicitor practising in Middleton, Nova Scotia.
Basically, it is a claim in professional negligence against Mr. Gillis for the losses sustained by FCC as a result of the alleged negligence of Gillis.
By letter of December 5, FCC confirmed that funds would be available to the Langilles.
One of the conditions in paragraph 4 of the letter states:""That you are willing to supply the Corporation with a valid milk assignment to repay your mortgage loan on a monthly basis.
The exact amount of the monthly payments shall be determined at the time the loan is disbursed and you shall be advised of the amount required.""
By a copy of the covering letter the Langille brothers purportedly accepted the terms and returned the letter dated December 12, 1978 which is stamped as received by FCC on December 18, 1978.","An appeal from an order which quashed an interim order of the Labour Relations Board (LRB) pending the determination of a grievance by an arbitration board, even though no proceedings were pending before the LRB and even though it had no power to make a final order respecting the proceedings before the arbitration board.
At issue was whether s5.3 of the Trade Union Act authorized the Board to make such an order.
HELD: The appeal was dismissed with costs.
 1)The Board recognized the question to be a jurisdictional question.
The standard of review is whether the decision was correct rather than patently unreasonable.
2)The chambers judge arrived at the correct conclusion whether from the point of view of the plain meaning of the words of s5.3 or the context of the entire statute or a purposive approach.
 3)S5.3 refers to the 'board' which is defined by s2(c) to be the LRB and accordingly referred to applications and orders of the LRB.
The interim power is not only based on the final power but is also part of the final power and both are part of the same process. 4)S25(1), when read with ss(1.1) and (1.2) indicates an intention on the part of the legislators to grant exclusive jurisdiction to arbitration boards to deal with disputes arising out of the interpretation of collective agreements. 5)Whatever the scope of s42, it cannot be used to release the restrictions of a statutory provision the very purpose of which is to define the jurisdiction of the LRB to act in respect of such matters.","[3, 0, 1, 4, 5, 7, 8, 10, 11, 6, 15, 12]"

The Act has since been significantly amended by R.S.N.S.
1989, c. 198.
Continental had applied to the Commission for a refund of the tax paid on certain refrigeration equipment which was installed in a new facility for pickled whole herring in Shelburne, Nova Scotia.
This product was mainly to be supplied on contract to the Soviet Union.
The contract contained stringent quality specifications governing the processing of this product which included a phase where the pickling occurs in a cooler facility for 28 to 45 days at a strictly controlled temperature of 0ºC to ‑2ºC.
The plant was intended to be used mainly to produce barrels of pickled salted herring for sale to Russia and eastern European countries.
The plant was to be used both for production and also for storage of products produced elsewhere by Continental or its related companies.","At issue was whether the right of appeal to a board of revision against a municipal tax assessment was exercised properly having regard for s303(1) of the Rural Municipality Act and how and when notice was given.
The company posted the notice of appeal by registered mail the day before the expiration of the 20 day appeal period.
The notice arrived at the post office on a Friday, the day after the period expired and was picked up by the administrator the following Monday.
The Appeals Committee refused to direct the board of revision to hear the appeal on the basis the company failed to give notice within the period prescribed by s303(1) and concluded that the board did not have the power to extend the time.
HELD: The appeal was allowed.
The board of revision was directed to hear and determine the assessment appeal.
1)The Committee did not err in deciding the prescribed time period for an appeal could not be extended.

There were two children of the marriage and both daughters are adults, have left home, and are married.
The parties executed a separation agreement dated the 3rd day of August, 1989.
As was indicated by Mr. Justice Hallet in Ryan v. Ryan (1981), 43 N.S.R.
(2d) 423 the starting point in a family matter is to appreciate the position of the parties under the Matrimonial Property Act before proceeding with the matter of maintenance.
Such a course is essential where there are allegations of duress, undue influence, and unconscionability.
The result of the division will normally, as it does here, shed light on these questions.
Mr. Durocher advances the following as the division of assets as of the date of the agreement.
In addition, Mrs. Durocher claims that an indebtedness to her mother in the amount of $9,000 should be taken into account in the division of matrimonial assets and liabilities.
This requires the court to grapple with the value of such.
The first paragraph provides the parties shall live separate and apart without interference, etc.","The decision of the Board of Arbitration was held by the chambers judge to be fundamentally flawed in that the majority brushed aside basic grammatical conventions; had proceeded upon a bad principle of construction obviously weighted in favour of the grievance; had discarded the ordinary meaning of some words; and had violated the terms of the agreement precluding alteration of its provisions.
She also held that one cannot ignore the phrase 'pursuant to Article 28 or 26', read it out of existence nor re-write it and that if the words were given their ordinary meaning the interpretation was patently unreasonable.
HELD: The appeal was dismissed.
1)The trial judge did not err in concluding the majority decision of the Board of Arbitration was patently unreasonable.
Its decision rested upon an interpretation of the collective bargaining agreement that the words of the agreement could not reasonably bear.
2)No material error was found in her analysis in finding that the decision was fundamentally flawed or in her analysis of the phrase 'pursuant to Article 28'.
Nor in her identification or application of the governing standard of review.
DISSENT:
The appeal would have been allowed. 1)There was no dispute that the central issue, the reviewability of the board's interpretation, requires an application of the test prescribed by Shalansky.
The Chambers judge did not follow that approach.
Once it is accepted that there are two reasonable constructions, the suggestion of a reviewable error of law in consensual arbitration disappears.
The decision can only be set aside if it involves an interpretation the words of the agreement could not reasonably bear.
The patently unreasonable test is a very strict test. 2)The judge was wrong to use the Melford decision to support her conclusion that the Pool interpretation was the only one which the words of the collective agreement could reasonably bear. 3)Once the ordinary meaning of the words 'pursuant to' must be set aside by reason of their context in Article 16, the decision by an adjudicator to choose either 'for the purposes of' or 'subject to' is motivated more by the result desired rather than by fine legal principles of interpretation.
Such policy decisions are better left to arbitrators in the field than to judges.","[2, 14, 4, 17, 13, 28, 16, 21, 24, 10, 11, 9, 15]"

When his federal government management position was declared redundant, the applicant received a retiring allowance of $75,646 in May 1997.
The respondent opposed the application on the basis there had been no change in circumstances since the judgment was granted; she had no other income than the support payments and child tax credit; alternatively, there were special provisions in the parties' separation agreement which would permit the court to award an amount that differs from the amount prescribed by the Guidelines.HELD: 1)The judgment the applicant sought to vary was made after the coming into force of the Guidelines.

 2)It could not be concluded on the evidence presented that there was any special provision in the parties' agreement that directly or indirectly benefited either child.
The provision for child support in a specified amount greater than that provided in the Guidelines was not a 'special provision' as contemplated by s17(6.2) of the Divorce Act given the change in circumstances of the applicant whose annual income had dropped from $55,500 to $24,000 a year.

BACKGROUNDShawn Edward Nicholson described how his injuries were incurred.
While overtaking the dump truck, it turned left and his right side came into contact with the dump truck.
He rolled over the hood of the truck, travelled 25 to 30 feet, landing in the ditch in mud and grass.
His initial reaction was to feel a sharp pain in his back and he feared paralysis.
Shawn noted his pants were ripped at the right knee and blood was coming from a wound in that area.

At issue were the determination of the father's income and whether the expenses of the eldest child attending Grade 12 in Manitoba constituted extaordinary expenses for secondary school education pursuant to s7(1)(d).
The father's reduced farm income was explained as due to poor crop yields.
He anticipated being laid off from his work at the mine in October.
He claimed significant vehicle expenses for his travel to work.
The mother contested many of his expenses as being overstated.
HELD: The respondent's child support obligation was $347 per month.
1)It was fair and reasonable to take an average of the 1997 and projected 1998 income.
The preceeding years were not significant because the father's current income at the mine commenced in May 1997.
Travelling expenses would not be considered in the absence of the accounting advice to explain the basis for the deduction and to establish the actual amount and where no deduction has been made in the past.
No explanation was offered for why the claims for gas and repairs were significantly higher than in previous years.
The capital payments for land and machinery and the costs of the stepchild's horse were excluded.
In the circumstances the acquisition of equipment and capital cost allowance, in lieu of renting, was not patently unreasonable.
The farm income was adjusted in 1997 and 1998 by adding back 25 percent of the capital cost allowance for the new truck.
The acquisition of a $43,000 vehicle was an extravagance given his income bracket and his obligation to support his children.
His allocation of one-half its cost to farming was questionable given the distances tavelled during his employment at the mine.
2)There was no evidence why the child attended high school in Manitoba, why the expense was necessary in relation to the child's best interest and whether the child had any means to contribute.
Leave was given to return the matter to the Court with the appropriate supporting materials.

Constable Maureen White (""White"" or ""the applicant"") argues that the Nova Scotia Police Review Board erred in finding her guilty of a disciplinary default for which she had not been charged.
The Board contends that it was fully entitled to do so.
BACKGROUND:In February and March, 1990 members of the public wrote to the Chief of Police of the City of Dartmouth to complain about the conduct of Constable White in the course of an investigation into an alleged assault.
All three complaints arose from the same incident.
Two of the complainants were victims of the alleged assault while the third was a parent of one of the victims.
The complaints were formalized as required by N.S.
Reg.
101/88, s. 6(3)(a), made pursuant to the Police Act, R.S.N.S.
1989, c. 348, s. 7.
The substance of the formalized complaints was that Constable White lied to the complainants concerning the investigation and that she treated them in a rude and abrupt manner.
Constable White was given notice of the allegation against her by Form 11, pursuant to Reg.
16(8), on March 20, 1990.","FIAT. The parties were married in 1973 and separated in 1992.

The wife counter-petitioned in 1993 claiming a 'lump sum and periodic spousal support'.
An interspousal contract entered into 1993 provided for periodic monthly spousal support of $350.
Both acknowledged that they were aware of the nature and effect of the agreement and each had independent legal advice before signing.
The husband paid periodic spousal support until December 1995.
The applicant sought to vary the 1993 order on the grounds there had been a change in circumstances in that her annual income was currently less than half of what it had been at the time the order was made and her economic hardship could be traced to the breakdown of her marriage primarily because his job had required them to move from place to place during the marriage.
HELD: The application was dismissed.
1)The agreement was intended to be final.
While the applicant's income had dropped she had not established that she could not be self-sufficient.
The terms of the agreement which limited the payment of spousal support to December 1995 appeared to be applicable.
The applicant had previously brought a similar variation application even though she earned in excess of $25,000 in 1995.
2)There was no suggestion that the agreement was unfairly negotiated or that she was subjected to undue influence or pressure in any way prior to signing and she had been advised by counsel.

I first determined that all necessary requirements for service had been complied with under the C.P.
Rules.
I allowed the plaintiffs' several claims for special damages (more particularly described, infra) but reserved on the issue of damages for mental distress until I had a chance to consider the authorities.
I asked Mr. Wheeler to file a post‑hearing brief and I am grateful for the very careful and thorough analysis provided in his memorandum of June 14th.
Before commenting on the several heads of damage I must first explain the background.
The salient features are that an agreement of purchase and sale was entered into between the parties on April 6, 1990.
Accordingly, notice was given to the defendants Later that day the defendants waived the conditional sale clause.
This documentation included an executed warranty deed.
Through inadvertence the legal description of the plaintiffs' property was omitted from the deed.
Accordingly, no tender of closing proceeds was made.","The plaintiffs sought a declaration that they had complied with the requirements of s27 of the Saskatchewan Farm Security Act and an order requiring the defendant to sell them the lands which were subject to their right of first refusal under the Act.
The defendant objected on the basis the plaintiff did not meet the time frame requirements set out in s27(2)(b) as an unconditional and unequivocal letter of committment to finance the purchase had not been issued by the Farm Credit Corporation.
The defendant counterclaimed for rent owing by the plaintiffs as overholding tenants.
HELD: A declaration issued that the plaintiffs had complied with s27 of the Farm Security Act in exercising their right of first refusal and the defendant was to forthwith transfer the land to the plaintiffs for $629,280 on the usual trust conditions.
The defendants' counterclaim was dismissed.
1)The defendant waived its right to insist on strict compliance with the legislation.
Prior to the May letter the plaintiffs had complied with the original obligation to provide a letter of committment from a recognized financial institution.
The request for a letter addressed to it from a financial institution was first made in May 1997 and was an attempt to unilaterally change the initial requirement imposed on the plaintiffs.
2)Both the wording of s27(2)(b)(ii) and the wording used by the defendant in its offer of first refusal refer to a letter of committment to finance.
A letter of credit binding the financial institution to advance the money in any event would be beyond the means of most farmers who had recently experienced difficult financial circumstances.
To interpret the letter of committment referred to in the Act in a manner that would exclude mortgage financing would eliminate the ability of most farmers to exercise the right of first refusal.
There were no conditions precedent attached to the committment. 3)As the plaintiffs were entitled to relief the arguments concerning adequacy of notice from the defendant was not addressed. 4)The plaintiffs were awarded costs.","[0, 1, 11, 5, 9, 10, 4, 13, 16, 27, 26, 29, 12, 21, 3]"

Hearings in the arbitration matter were held in Halifax, November 27th 1990; January 18th 1991 and February 1st 1991.

Tri-Link issued a replacement cheque.
The first cheque was certified at a bank branch of the plaintiff in Alberta and deposited to the defendants' credit union account.
Default judgments were obtained in January/March 1997 against the defendants who now sought to have them set aside pursuant to Queen's Bench Rules 346 and 173(a).
The defendants claimed the statement of claim disclosed no cause of action as a certified cheque is irrevocable and as such any default judgment may be set aside ex debito justitiae, in which case delay in bringing the application is not factor.
The plaintiff claims it has a cause of action in either conversion or mistake of fact/unjust enrichment.
HELD: The defendants' motion was dismissed as the plaintiff's statement of claim adequately disclosed a cause of action in mistake of fact/unjust enrichment.
 1)There are exceptions to the irrevocable nature of a certified cheque.
The present case is one of those circumstances where the bank has an action in restitution against the holder of a certified cheque as payment did not satisfy a just debt.
The defendants in this instance had already deposited the replacement cheque when the original cheque was presented for certification and subsequently deposited by the defendants.
The cerified cheque did not satisfy a just debt.
The defendants had already received payment for their services.
 2)In recognizing exceptions to the irrevocable nature of certification the commercial utility of certification at the request of the payee is maintained while providing recourse to a bank where a payee seeks to unjustly enrich itself and then purport to seek refuge behind the 'irrevocable nature' of a certified cheque.","[2, 5, 13, 10, 6, 3, 15, 14, 17]"

An application pursuant to Rule 188 for a determination of whether the defendant was liable pursuant to s86(1) of the Highway Traffic Act for the personal injuries of the infant plaintiff or was immune from liability by virtue of s228 [now s232] of the Education Act.
The second point of law to be determined was whether the co-defendant as car owner was liable if the driver was found to be immune from liability.
The motor vehicle accident occurred while the infant plaintiff was being transported during a field trip, approved by the defendant school board, and the defendant was the teacher.
HELD: 1)The teacher/driver was acting within the scope of her duties and was immune from liability by virtue of the Education Act.
2)The owner was only liable to the same extent as the driver.
The reasoning in Neault was directly on point.
Just as the Workers' Compensation Act and the Highway Traffic Act prevent the injured worker from suing the owner of the vehicle because he is prevented from suing the driver, the Education Act extends the same immunity to the owner as it does to the driver by operation of s86(1) of the Highway Traffic Act.
3)There was no apparent conflict between the statutes.
When read together, the legislation provides that a negligent teacher is granted immunity from liability if the teacher has acted within the scope of the Education Act.
The Traffic Act is the general statute, governing liability of all drivers.
The Court did not agree with the School Board's analysis that the Education Act was the general statute.
4)The injured plaintiff was not denied a party to sue for negligent operation of a vehicle as he had recourse against the school board and its insurer.
The immunity under the Education Act only applies to teachers and principals.","[3, 10, 8, 1, 0, 5, 7, 9, 17, 19, 4, 18, 12, 15]"

Mr. Chandler, who represents the v/plaintiffs, at that time, agreed to obtain additional affidavit evidence in the hope of satisfying the p/defendants that the v/plaintiffs have good title to the property.
Additional affidavit evidence has been adduced, but the v/plaintiffs still maintain their objection to title.
Counsel agreed that in deciding the application, I could consider all the additional material provided.
After having heard counsel further on December 20, 1990, I granted the application with written reasons for so doing to follow.
The cause of the vendor's concern The property in question is a residential lot with a purported 40' frontage on the north side of Kaye Street in the City of Halifax.
Alex Bond, prior to 1913 by two separate deeds, one containing 80' of frontage and the other 60', acquired a total of 140' of frontage on the northside of Kaye Street in Halifax.
As the issue before me deals with missing lot frontage, for the purposes of this application I will refer only to the frontage of the various lots conveyed.
The 140' frontage acquired by Bond was bounded on the west by property of the Memorial United Church or its predecessors in title and on the east by one Trider or his predecessors in title.","In issue was whether the law firm was in a conflict of interest with respect to two matrimonial files and whether the firm could remain as counsel for the spouses.
HELD: 1)A lawyer with Olive Waller acts as counsel for Janie Magnes and Daniel L'Heureux.
The lawyer who recently joined the law firm of Olive Waller had worked on both files of the opposing spouses while practicing law with another firm.
At the time she left she was the solicitor for Mr. Magnes.
She had received confidential information from both opposing spouses.
2)The screen was sufficient and there was not a risk of mischief in the circumstances of this case.
There was no real risk that either would be prejudiced if the law firm continued to act.
A reasonable member of the public, in possession of the facts and aware of the screening procedures set in place, would conclude that no unauthorized disclosure of confidential information occurred or would occur.
There were numerous independently verifiable steps taken by the subsequent firm to implement screening.
Both lawyers and support staff were instructed in writing not to discuss either matters or the lawyer's prior representation of those clients with her.
The files were physically segregated from the regular filing system in a locked cabinet.
The files were specifically identified and accessible only to those lawyers and support staff who were working on the matter.
The computer files were encoded and segregated on the firm's network and access was limited to two people. 3)There was no order as to costs.","[3, 5, 0, 6, 7, 4, 11, 8, 12, 10]"

The application was heard as a contested chambers application (application inter partes) on September 10th and 11th, 1992.
By agreement of the parties the hearing was restricted to the issue of the law firms of Boyne, Clarke and Blake, Cassels & Graydon continuing to act for the Trustee.
The law firm of Blake, Cassels & Graydon, based in Toronto has acted for and continues to act for the Bank in its dealings with the bankrupt estate.
Boyne, Clarke act as agent for Blake, Cassels in relation to the interests of the Bank in Nova Scotia.
The Bank has guaranteed payment of the Trustee's fees and disbursements, including legal fees.
The applicant, NsC Corp is the sole shareholder of the bankrupt and claims to be a creditor of the bankrupt.
The respondent concedes that there are areas of potential conflict with the law firms acting for both the Bank and Trustee, but submits that if a conflict arises the Trustee would seek independent counsel on the conflicting matter.
The respondent argues that to order the Trustee to retain other counsel at this time would create a great financial burden because of the time required by new counsel to acquaint itself with information already in the knowledge of present counsel.","Custody, child support and division of matrimonial property were in dispute.
The mother was awarded interim custody of the three children in 1997.
The father was ordered to pay child support of $405 per month but had made only one voluntary payment of $100.
He agreed to abandon his appeal of the order for sale of the matrimonial home.
He had been unable to obtain financing to buy out her share.
The father, unrepresented by counsel, sought to have selected portions of 14 hours of taped telephone conversations with the children and wife admitted into evidence.
He insisted the tapes were of central importance to his case; that they discredited the conclusions of the custody and access report and demonstrated abuse was occurring in the mother's home.
HELD: 1)Sole custody was awarded to the mother.
The father was to have access Friday from 5:00 p.m. until Tuesday at 9:00 every second weekend.
2)The tapes were admitted in their totality, unedited.
The two lines of cases respecting the admission of audiotapes in a custody hearing were reviewed.
The tapes had the opposite effect to the father's intent.
The father 'alternatively interrogated the children about their mother; prompted them to make unfavourable comments about her; magnified every incident of childish squabbling into a crisis; magnified the children's distress over the marital breakdown, encouraged the children to run to his home at every opportunity; and generally undermined the mother's parental authority at every available turn.'
The petitioner's depression had been ascribed to environmental stresses rather than innate.
The father acknowledged that his drinking had lessened but not discontinued as he suggested in the custody and access report.
3)The property was to be sold.
The father was responsible for mortgage payments from July 1998 until the date of sale as he had stopped making mortgage payments after the previous order while continuing to reside in the home.
A corresponding adjustment in the net sale proceeds was to be made in the wife's favour.
Child maintenance was to be satisfied from the father's share of the sale proceeds.
4)The mother's employment pension was to be divided equally and one half rolled into an RRSP designated by the father.
RRSP's were to be divided equally.
Furniture, furnishings and personal effects in their possession would be retained by each party.
Hunting clothes or supplies and one half of the family photographs were to be returned to the father.
The loan from the respondent's mother was statute-barred.
No repayments had been made in 10 years.
The debt for the half ton acquired after separation was the father's sole responsibility.
5)The prior order of $405 for child support remained in effect.
The father made no income disclosure until trial and evidence of his 1991 income was unsatisfactory.
Rental income was deemed to his 1998 income.
No order was made for day care costs due to inadequate proof.
The parties could seek a review if more comprehensive evidence were produced.
6)Judgment for divorce would be made final on the expiration of 31 days.","[3, 5, 7, 13, 11, 8, 0, 14, 10]"

(Orally)This is an application for an Order in the nature of Habeas Corpus and an Order in the nature of Certiorari in aid thereof.
The applicant was remanded into custody upon her committal for trial on a charge of first degree murder following a preliminary inquiry into the charge.
The applicant, through her counsel, contends that the Provincial Court judge erred in committing the applicant for trial and that her detention is, therefore, unlawful.","FIAT. A defendant applied for an order pursuant to the inherent jurisdiction of the court, alternatively s.50 of the Queen's Bench Act, for an order requiring the plaintiff to be examined by a qualified psychiatrist within 30 days; requiring a report to be filed with the court as to whether the plaintiff is mentally competent to instruct his solicitor; and staying proceedings until a report is filed.
The certificate of incompetence issued in December 1998 was revoked (QBG No. 690/1999) on the basis the competency examination was obtained by subterfuge (other parties had asked the plaintiff to attend a physical examination for a fictitious purpose but conducted a competency examination); there was no record of the review panel hearing; no reasons were given for the decision to uphold the certificate.
The plaintiff alleged the issuance of the certificate caused mental anguish, emotional suffering, and loss of liberty and alleged conspiracy, abuse of process, breach of fiduciary duty and negligence.
HELD: The application was dismissed.
 1)Our civil procedure does not contemplate the trial of an issue on a person's competence to bring a lawsuit.
A certificate of incompetence issued pursuant to the Act had the same effect as a finding that the person is incapable of instructing counsel or understanding legal proceedings and would result in the appointment of a litigation guardian.
This step was not deemed necessary based on the evidence presented.
A stay was refused.
 2)Costs incurred in defending a civil action against a person who is subsequently found to be incapable of managing his or her estate are recoverable from the estate.
3)Queen's Bench Act s.50 did not apply.
 4)The plaintiff was entitled to his costs in any event of the cause.","[0, 1, 4, 8, 5, 2, 7, 9, 10, 6]"

Pavey, for the Appellant C. Berryman, for the Respondent DAVISON, J.: (Orally)I will deliver a decision.
It might be subject to editing and to enhancing but the parties are entitled to know as soon as possible what my decision will be.
This is an appeal from the decision of Judge Levy of the Family Court for the Province of Nova Scotia, which bears date 14th day of July 1993.
The appeal is taken pursuant to Section 44 of the Family Maintenance Act, R.S.N.S., 1989, Chapter 160.
Section 44 (1) reads;“ 44 (1) An appeal lies to the county court from any decision, judgment or order of a court or a judge thereof.
(2) The county court shall not rehear the evidence on an appeal but shall consider the record from the court.
Since the merger of the two courts, the designation of Supreme Court should be substituted for the reference in the statute to the County Court.","The applicant asserted the third party (the respondent's father's company) paid $55,000 to the respondent's company in contravention of the June 7, 1999 order which directed any funds accruing to the company be paid into court and froze any money to be paid out.
The third party argued the application essentially sought a contempt citation and should be directed to trial.
The second issue concerned the respondent's opposition to the applicant's request for leave to move to Alberta, arguing that the move will be tantamount to a denial of access.
The applicant had been prohibited in a 1998 order from removing the children from Saskatchewan without a court order, absent consent.HELD: 1)The issue of the payments was directed to trial and pre-trial conference to be held in January.
2)The mother was granted leave to move the children to Alberta.
Their primary residence was to continue to be with her.
She was encouraged to attain self-sufficiency.
Access was to be maintained and the mother was ordered to return the children to Saskatchewan for purposes of allowing the respondent to exercise access in accordance with existing orders.
Additional access was granted provided he picked up and returned the children to the applicant's residence.
3)The 1998 interim order for exclusive possession of the matrimonial home was not changed.
The applicant was at liberty to rent the home.
4)The applicant was directed to take all reasonable steps to sell the recreational trailer in her possession and to pay the sale proceeds to the bank to discharge the lien and the balance into court.
She was to file an affidavit of bona fides as to the sale which should relieve her of the obligation for payment of the loan.
 5)Costs were reserved to the trial.","[4, 0, 5, 1, 3, 6, 7, 2, 9]"

(Orally)The major item in dispute between the parties in this divorce hearing is the amount of spousal and child support.
The respondent, Ms. Mosher, is also seeking unequal division of the matrimonial assets and compensatory support or a lump sum award.
On the matter of the petition for divorce; I am satisfied that the ground has been proven and I grant the petition for divorce.
I am further satisfied that there is no possibility of reconciliation.
Mr. and Ms. Mosher have resolved most of the matters relating to the divorce and have signed a Partial Minutes of Settlement, the relevant terms of which I will incorporate into the Corollary Relief Order.
These include provisions that Ms. Mosher will have custody of the three children of the marriage and Mr. Mosher will have reasonable scheduled access as outlined in the Minutes.
Ms. Mosher seeks an unequal division or a claim for compensatory support.
BACKGROUNDThe parties met at the start of their university education and not long thereafter the respondent became pregnant and they began a period of cohabitation.
Nova Scotia, with a downpayment based on a $5,000 inheritance received by Ms. Mosher.
Obviously, all of these developments reflect the initiative and dedication of the two parties to creating a successful marriage economic unit.","The plaintiff lawyer commenced an action for fees and disbursements in the amount of $4,647.85.
The proposed garnishee, SPMC, paid $337.46 into court and brought an application for an order pursuant to Rules 411 and 415(1) of the Queen's Bench Rules of Court.
An order that any further amounts due and owing from SPMC to the company be paid into court to be disposed as directed by the court was granted with taxed costs to SPMC.
Labour Standards filed notice of potential wage claims.
The plaintiff obtained default judgment and made an ex parte application for payment out of the monies paid into court by SPMC.
HELD: The applicant/plaintiff was to be paid all monies paid into court by SPMC with respect to the two files together with accrued interest less the amount previously paid out.
The claim by the Minister of Labour was dismissed.
Although the monies paid into court according to the decision in Polyco Window Manufacturing Ltd v. Prudential Assurance Co create a fund from which creditors must be paid, the claim by the Minister of Labour as of the date of the application was not a proven claim.
No certificate had been issued and no judgment had been entered as of that date.

Plaintiff‑ and ‑ NOVA ENTERPRISES LIMITED, a body corporate and JAMES MACKAYDefendants DECISION HEARD: at Halifax, Nova Scotia, before the Honourable Associate Chief Justice Ian H. M. Palmeter, on March 17th and 18th, 1993.
DECISION: June 10th , 1993COUNSEL: Michael J.
Wood, Esq., Counsel for the Plaintiff Peter Rogers, Esq., and Rod Jordan, Articled Clerk, Counsel for the Defendants PALMETER, A.C.J.
This matter was heard by me on March 17th and 18th, 1993 and adjourned for decision.
The action was commenced by the plaintiff for the alleged breach of contract of a written contract between the parties and damages therefore, or, in the alternative, damages for unjust enrichment.
The defendants have counterclaimed for damages based on alleged negligent misrepresentation on the part of the plaintiff.
After hearing all of the evidence and perusing the documentation tendered, I have determined the facts in this case to be the following.
The plaintiff (Sign‑O‑Lite) is in the business of manufacturing, selling and leasing commercial signs and has a construction facility in Toronto, Ontario.
This evidence has convinced me that Nova was well aware of, and wary of, governmental regulatory problems.","The accused was charged with uttering threats to his 77 year old mother to cause death to her and his brothers contrary to s.264.1 of the Criminal Code.
HELD: The accused was found guilty.
1)The words spoken by the accused were clearly meant to be taken seriously and implied menace to the listeners.
The accused's evidence was disbelieved.
His constructed story did not 'hang together'.
 2) In a non-jury trial there is ordinarily no need for defence to formally make a Corbett application, requesting an order excluding evidence of convictions whose prejudicial effect outweighs their probative value.
The judge must not infer from the record that the accused has a propensity to commit criminal offences.
Given the age of the record and other factors considered including his present work and family life, it was concluded that all of the prior convictions should be disregarded as they relate to the accused's credibility.
The only conclusion drawn was that the accused had been familiar with the workings of the criminal justice system which was not a negative inference.","[2, 7, 8, 0, 1, 5, 10, 3, 9, 11, 4, 6, 16]"

Mr. Hiltz is claiming damages for personal injuries.
Liability has been admitted by the defendant and special damages have been resolved between the parties.
Mr. Hiltz, age 33, is married with three children, ages 7, 6 and 2.
He has Grade 10 education plus two years vocational school training and has been working for 15 years.
At the time of the accident, he worked as a technician which involved body work including heavy frame work, panel replacement and painting.
In March 1989, he became a supervisor which changed his job in some respects although he still filled in as a technician when someone was absent or on vacation.
At discovery he said the job was a lot different.
He was in a line of cars and noted some difficulty further ahead.
He claims the next time he drove the vehicle, he noted that the driver's seat was twisted, that is, the left side was bent back three or four inches.
Although his car suffered damage, he suffered no personal injuries and considered it a simple fender bender.
Mr. Hiltz banged his head in the accident which he said made his head ring, but at the time, it was his only discomfort.","The appellant appealed from his conviction on a charge of criminal harassment.
He alleged that the verdict was unreasonable and not supported by the evidence.
In addition, he claimed that the trial judge had erred in admitting as evidence an audiotape of a confrontation between the complainant and the appellant.

; Jones and Chipman, JJ.A.
concurringThe reasons for judgment of the Court were delivered orally by:HART, J.A.
The appellant, a young man in his early 20's, was convicted after a two and a half day trial before Judge Haliburton of the County Court of the offence of sexually touching a young girl under the age of 14 years contrary to s. 151 of the Criminal Code of Canada,R.S.C.
1985, c. C‑46.
The first ground of appeal alleged that the trial judge was in error by permitting the complainant to testify behind a screen without first conducting a voir dire and by relying solely upon the representations of Crown counsel to the effect that she would be uncomfortable without a screen.
The second ground was that the trial judge permitted the complainant to read a statement she had given to the police to refresh her memory during cross‑examination.
It was, however, the defence counsel who put the statement to her and who originally suggested that she read it over.
We find no merit in this ground of appeal.","The appellants sought to admit fresh evidence.
HELD: 1)A new trial was ordered.
The due diligence requirement was relaxed in light of the allegation of arson in the respondent's statement of defence.
Although the expert evidence was available at trial, counsel failed to competently present the evidence.
The fresh evidence could reasonably have affected the trial result respecting the cause of the fire.
 2)The appellants were to pay party and party costs plus the respondent's cost of all proceedings in the Court of Appeal including preparation for the appeal taxed on double column V on or before July 15, 2000.
In default of payment the appellant's claim may be struck.","[0, 2, 1, 5, 4, 7, 3, 12, 10, 6, 11, 8]"

(Orally)Armoyan Properties Limited has undertaken the residential development of certain lands in the County of Halifax.
Bordering Armoyan lands are certain lands of the Estate of Samuel Haverstock.
Armoyan has sold house lots in its subdivision and houses have been constructed.
Armoyan has also constructed roadways.
One such road is one lot removed from and parallel to lands of Haverstock.
Armoyan has proposed to convey roadways to the Nova Scotia Department of Transportation and Communications.
That Department has indicated that before it will accept a conveyance and responsibility for the roadways, it requires the consent of the owners of property where water will drain from the road; in this case the Haverstock Estate.
The Haverstock Estate has refused to consent to such drainage across its lands and has refused to surrender its right to future claims, should damage occur.
Armoyan made application to the Municipality of the County of Halifax for implementation of proceedings under the Ditches and Water Courses Act, R.S.N.S.

Meetings pursuant to that Act failed to achieve agreement.
Armoyan therefore filed a requisition with the Clerk of the County pursuant to s.7(1) of that Act.

This agreement held that the sum of $550 (adjusted for inflation) is to be paid to the wife until she dies or remarries, whichever comes first.
The applicant paid this amount (except for a unilateral deduction in 1995) for over 25 years.
The basis of his application is that he is now retired and earning less income.
In addition, the respondent now earns part-time income that she did not have at the time of the agreement.
At the time of the agreement, the wife raised the couple's five children and received child support from the applicant.
HELD: The application is dismissed with costs to the respondent.
The SCC has held that in order for a Court to vary support provisions in a valid settlement, separation agreement or consent order, a material or radical change in circumstances causally connected to the marriage needs to be established.
Retirement of one of the parties was reasonably foreseeable at the time they entered into the agreement.
It was also foreseeable that retirement income is most often less than employment income.
This is not the kind of radical unforeseen change in circumstance required to vary the support.
The preamble of the parties' agreement states that they intended it to be a complete and final settlement.
The applicant has always earned considerable income and continues to have a better standard of living than the respondent.
The respondent's modest income does not provide grounds to vary the agreement as she still has a much lower standard of living that the applicant, even after receiving the spousal support.","[0, 2, 3, 9, 10, 8, 11, 5, 4, 6, 13, 7, 12, 20]"

The objections were categorized as the questions sought to elicit the plaintiff's manner of investigation or expert opinions; it should have been asked of another witness better suited to answer or third parties as the questions relate to issues between the defendant and the third parties; it was irrelevant or improper.
HELD: 1)The plaintiffs were not required to answer questions which would require them to accept or reject an opinion of another party to the action.
2)The plaintiffs should answer what cellulose fibre insulation was present at the time of the fire.
3)The affidavit answered whether Miner was a participant in the investigation notwithstanding the defendants are not entitled to the names of possible expert witnesses at the discovery stage.
4)Any meeting between the plaintiff's investigators and the fire marshal clearly related to its investigation and is privileged.
The defendants could obtain the information directly from the fire marshal.
5)The question of whether there was any liaison between the city fire investigator and SIAST was improper as it relates to the manner of investigation.
Questions can be asked of the city.
6)Details of the plaintiff's investigation, including an engineer's report, was protected by litigation privilege.
7)The question regarding what observations were made of the damage was too vague.
The plaintiff's claim was in excess of $7 million.
A proper foundation must be laid in the context of specific questions and answers given or not given (Hill v. Arcola School Division).
The defendants are not entitled to expert opinion.
8)Whether SPMC's insurer's investigation team participated related to manner of investigation and was therefore privileged.
9)The defendant will be able to examine the city in the third party claim with respect to documents from the fire department.
10)All discussions at mediation proceedings are strictly confidential.
The name of the plaintiff's expert, who prepared the drawings in contemplation of litigation, is privileged.
11)The facts and observations upon which expert opinions are based must be disclosed including any photographs.
 12)Whether any pattern on the wood would indicate contact by propane flame required expert opinion. 13)Questions concerning what material first ignited could only be answered by having experts reconstruct what in their opinion occurred at the time the fire started. 14)If the plaintiffs do not have a position (on whether there was a fire stop in the 1967 construction of the tower), there is no rule the court is aware of requiring them to adopt a position.
They can be required to give an undertaking to provide a position if they adopt one at a later date.
Whether they believed the building was built in accordance with the 1960 fire code when constructed in 1967 was information obtainable by the defendants. 15)If the party being examined had no control over or greater access to a witness than the examining party, it need only disclose the evidence known to it.
There is no obligation to seek information from third parties when the defendants are capable of obtaining that information. 16)An undertaking was given to advise if and when the plaintiffs develop a position on whether the parapet roof was constructed in accordance with the detail set out in FC and whether the detail in the sketch of the Tower parapet was correct. 17)If the request for the proposal related to Kelsey, the document should be produced, but if it only related to the Regina campus, the document was not relevant. 18)Whether it was considered anytime that Hagblom would be a sub-consultant was a legal question.
The trial judge will interpret the terms of the agreement.
19)Any information required could be obtained directly from the architects who had been added as third parties by the defendants.
 20)The plaintiffs gave undertakings to answer the other questions and did not object to answering them.
21)The 36 objections (less 3 that were withdrawn) failed.
It would be an abuse of process for the defendants to ask the same question of a second officer hoping to obtain a different answer.
The same question can be put if the first did not answer it.
The fact there were three separate officers does not restrict the defendants to only asking certain questions of each.
The reason for having three officers, each with a different expertise in a certain area, was to prevent the plaintiffs from having to give endless undertakings.

Defence counsel was to break it down. 23)There were 200 undertakings.

DECISION ON SENTENCINGRevised Decision: The text of the original decision has been revised to remove personal identifying information of the parties on January 27, 2008.
(Orally)T.V.G., you were convicted by a jury of sexually assaulting B.S., your common‑law spouse.
The offence is contrary to s. 271(1) of the Criminal Code.
The evidence presented to the jury was that you and Ms. B.S.
had separated a few days before this offence.
She continued to reside in her home where you had lived together.
You called her late in the night preceding the offence.
You had entered her house sometime during the night ‑ you confronted her ‑ forced her into the bedroom and raped her, despite her struggles.
According to her evidence, during your repeated penetration of her you questioned her about other boyfriends.
Ms. B.S.
testified, as well, that before raping her, you said that you did not care if you went to jail for this.
Clearly, you appreciated the nature of your conduct and the possible consequences.
Sexual assault is a crime of violence.
In crimes of violence, general deterrence is the primary focus, although not the only consideration.","The borrower in a mortgage foreclosure action counterclaimed against the lender and joined the insurer of the mortgage and experts he had retained for advice in the development on the basis of negligent misrepresentation.
During discovery of the borrower's former solicitor it was revealed that the solicitor may have given the borrower a warning that the financing arranged was inadequate.
No privilege was claimed during the discovery process.
The defendant brought an application for production of the solicitor's files and a copy of the borrower's employer and bank records intended to show his familiarity with business and financial affairs.
Application allowed in part; solicitor's files with respect to terms of solicitor's retainer and non-legal advice or services are to be produced; employer's and banker's records not to be produced.
The claim of negligent misrepresentation raised the question of reliance; evidence of knowledge would go to the borrower's state of mind and the solicitor's warning, if timely, would be relevant.
The conduct of the borrower's present counsel in making no objection at the discovery amounted to waiver.
There were no special circumstances existing with respect to the employer's and bank's records; the applicant made no effort to obtain the records until too late and the documents would have little, if any, relevance.","[4, 5, 3, 6, 8, 0, 1, 7, 13, 12, 16, 11, 15, 14, 17]"

Therefore any content of this file which quotes or reveals evidence contained from the Preliminary Inquiry is banned from publication and so will continue until the date of trial.
This is an application by way of certiorari to quash the committal order of the Honourable Judge Matheson, Provincial Court Judge against the above named defendants.
All the accused elected trial by Judge and Jury and a Preliminary Inquiry was held during seven days between March 27th and April 8th, 1994, after which the learned Judge committed all accused to stand trial.
BACKGROUND[This paragraph contains evidence from the Preliminary Inquiry and, thus, has been redacted.]
[This paragraph contains evidence from the Preliminary Inquiry and, thus, has been redacted.]
I'll come back to them.
The powers and jurisdiction of a Judge holding a Preliminary Inquiry are largely controlled by the following Criminal Code sections:""Section 537.
[465] (1) A justice acting under this Part may(I) regulate the course of the inquiry in any way that appears to him to be desirable and that is not inconsistent with this Act.""

HELD: The appeals against conviction and sentence were dismissed.
The judge made no error in ruling that all of the evidence from the prospective witnesses and transcripts was irrelevant as being unrelated to the charges and too remote in time.
The appellant's state of mind was adequately established by his own evidence and the summation to the jury.
The defence was fully and fairly put to the jury which chose not to accept it.
The sentence appeal was moot since it was limited to time served while awaiting trial.
The Court would have found the sentence to be fit in any event.","[7, 0, 4, 8, 3, 10, 11, 16, 13, 12, 6]"

: (Orally)I want to thank counsel for providing their material in advance and I would indicate that I have listened very carefully to what has been said this morning and it, for the most part, echoes what is in the briefs already.
I have had the opportunity, as I said, of reading them and of reaching a decision on this matter and I'd like to give it now.
On November 10th, 1993, R.D.S was charged with three counts under the Criminal Code.
was finally tried on December 2nd, 1994, and following an oral decision on that date, was acquitted on all charges.
On December 22nd, 1994 the Crown filed a notice of appeal; on January 13th, 1994 the Learned Trial Judge filed Supplementary Reasons.","The appellant was unsuccessful in Queen's Bench in having his suspension and probation as a medical resident rescinded or to prohibit the Investigation Committee, which met on approximately seven occasions and interviewed seven witnesses, from taking further action.
The Chambers judge refused to grant relief, finding the issues to be academic in nature and within the exclusive jurisdiction of the University, but ruled his supervisor should be removed from the Committee because of an apprehension of bias.
The appellant applied to adduce fresh evidence consisting of a letter from the Investigating Committee describing how it intended to proceed.
The appellant argued the matter was disciplinary, not academic, and as it can ultimately result in his dismissal, he is entitled to procedural fairness, including a fair hearing, the right to cross-examination of witnesses, to call his own witnesses, to active legal representation and to full disclosure.
He argued all committee members, except the union representative, should be excluded by reason of bias.
HELD: The appeal was dismissed with costs on double Column V.
1)The material did not meet the test for the admission of fresh evidence.
It simply restated what was at issue and found to have had no effect.
2)There was no tenable basis for interfering.
The remedies are discretionary.
3)The Court was not prepared to grant the relief in any event, given the long delay in seeking recourse.
The initial concern was bias and jurisdiction.
The issue of whether the proceedings were academic or disciplinary was not raised until the application below.
4)The application was premature as there are other avenues of appeal provided in the regulations.
Proceedings should not be allowed to be fragmented and should be allowed to run their course so the court has a complete record from the tribunals below.
Certiorari should not be granted where there is a right of appeal, except in exceptional circumstances.","[0, 4, 1, 12, 5, 7, 8, 6, 11]"
747,"The main facts giving rise to this action have been extensively reviewed in four separate decisions, two in the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia and two in the Nova Scotia Court of Appeal, and all arise out of a tax sale of certain lands by the defendant, Municipality.
Sometime in 1990 the defendant, Municipality, sold at tax sale certain property owned by the plaintiffs to one Frank Maclnnes.
Because of disputes over ownership between the plaintiffs and Maclnnes, the latter commenced an action against the plaintiffs seeking a declaration as to the validity of the tax deed.
This action cited as Frank Arnold Maclnnes et al v. John E.Burton et al (1991), 1991 CanLII 4277 (NS SC), 110 N.S.R.
(2d) 380, Saunders, J. decided in Maclnnes' favour, upholding the validity of the tax sale and was critical of the behaviour of the plaintiffs regarding notices and knowledge of the tax sale.
The Burtons appealed this decision to the Court of Appeal, Burton, et al v. Maclnnes et al (1992), 116 N.S.R.
(2d), which overturned the trial division basically on the grounds that the sale itself was void.
(2d) 170, the third related action was to recover damages suffered by the Maclnnes' as a result of the aborted tax sale.","The wife sought distribution of family property in accordance with the Family Property Act.
HELD: The petitioner was given judgment for $51,725.82 with taxable costs of the action payable within 3 months, failing which, the petitioner may apply for directions as to sale of the family property.
The family property was divided equally from the date the action was commenced.
The legislation does not permit an exemption in the circumstances for the $12,000 from the sale of the respondent's trailer used to purchase the acreage.
It was concluded the respondent's father owned the tractor.
Two other tractors were exempt and a partial exemption was allowed for a snowmobile and some tools.
While he owned a truck prior to the marriage, it could not be traced to the current truck.
The petitioner's automobile and boat were added to the distribution value of the machinery.
There were no records of the value of the pigs.
Whatever the number brought into the marriage, it had been reduced by the sale of the animals.
The value of livestock to be distributed was $25,261.
The RRSP purchase prior to the marriage was exempt.
The claim for the debt for the tractor owned by the father and alleged debt for a rod weeder were rejected.
Debts owed to the father for a tractor and a truck were statute-barred.
The petitioner should bear no responsibility for monies paid for fertilizer, chemicals, fuel, repairs, parts and insurance as they were on-going expenses for the operation of the farm.
The petitioner's claim for $1,000, borrowed from a friend to pay legal fees, was not considered a matrimonial debt.","[2, 3, 1, 4, 7, 6, 5, 9]"

FACT On August 20th, 1995, the plaintiff, who at that time was five and one-half months pregnant, went with her common-law husband to a drive-in theatre located outside of Westville, Pictou County, operated by the defendant.
According to the plaintiff, they then watched the first of the two scheduled movies and at the intermission, after the first movie, she walked from their vehicle to the canteen building.
She was carrying the garbage from their food order being a couple of drink containers and some other paper containers which were on a tray which had been supplied when they purchased the items at the canteen.
She was also carrying her wallet.
She said she was going to the canteen to dump the garbage and return the tray.
She also wanted to use the washroom located inside the canteen and the pay phone to call her babysitter at home.
Introduced into evidence were a number of photographs showing the canteen building and the concrete sidewalk as it was in 1995.
The entrance to the canteen had a concrete sidewalk which was approximately four feet wide and goes along the entire front of the building.
There are four doors there, one of which was open as the plaintiff approached the building.
That was the door furthest to the right as you approach the building.","FIAT. The defendant sought to have costs reduced because the plaintiff was unsuccessful in part of her claim for damages for the injury to her ankle and resulting pain disorder when she fell after stepping on a metal plate bolted to the floor at the mall entrance of the defendant's store.
The plaintiff was awarded $77,406.15 plus special damages and pre-judgment interest for a total of $120,540.43.
The offer to settle for $75,000 plus taxable costs had been refused.
The defendant argued the plaintiff's bill of costs should be taxed at 50% as she only received about 13 and 1/3% of the amount claimed; the costs were disproportionate to the judgment and the offer to settle, made in good faith, was never formally responded to.
The plaintiff argued extensive witness costs were incurred because the defendant declined to agree to the filing of medical reports.
At issue was whether the success of each affects the amount of costs to be awarded to either; the amount to be awarded for expert witnesses; and level at which a second counsel fee should be taxed or allowed.
HELD: 1)Taxable costs should not be based on either hardship or the degree of success.
Solely because recovery falls short of the amount claimed is not a reason to deprive a successful party of costs.
Although costs are in the discretion of the Court, they usually go to the successful party.
2)It was appropriate in this case to reduce by 50% the plaintiff's costs taxable under column 4 since over half of the plaintiff's witnesses who were called to testify and most of the trial time was dedicated to the pain disorder claim, which proved only minor non-pecuniary damages.
3)A great deal of the plaintiff's expert medical evidence was of marginal value.
Great care must be taken by a party who obtains leave to call more than five expert witnesses to ensure their testimony will assist the case.
Expenses of each was examined separately.
In some cases, medical report charges or consultation and preparation time were not recoverable from the defendant as not being of value or too exorbitant.
4)A second counsel fee was allowed at 50% of first counsel fee.
A second counsel fee is in the discretion of the Court and is limited to two-thirds of the fee paid for first counsel.
The amount at risk and complexity of the pain disorder claim justified second counsel in this case.
Although one lawyer could have handled the trial without difficulty as there was considerable down time, that could not be known in advance. 5)Costs of the four pre-trial conferences, unspecified number of management pre-trial conferences, pre-trial brief, medical reports for doctors who were not called as witnesses are matters for consideration by the taxing officer rather than the Court.
It was recommended that no fee should be considered when there is simply an adjournment because the pre-trial conference is premature; there is no tariff item for a pre-trial brief and in most cases is included in the attendance charge; a charge of $50 for each management pre-trial conference be allowed to a total limit of $500; costs of transcripts be recovered from the defendant.
Costs payable by the plaintiff on an interlocutory application may be deducted from the plaintiff's Bill of Costs.","[0, 6, 10, 4, 13, 14, 5, 7, 8, 11, 2]"

: There is no dispute as to the motor vehicle accident that resulted in this action.
The plaintiff, Bertha Langille, 40 years of age at the date of the accident, is the common law wife of Vince Paris.
She was a passenger in the Paris vehicle.
She was injured as a result of the accident.
She sustained fractures to both of her wrists and broke her left ankle.
(Guardian)It is Bertha Langille’s claim against Guardian, pursuant to Schedule “B” of the Paris insurance policy, that is the subject of this trial.
She seeks, therefore, compensation for loss of income from employment.
In fact, Guardian compensated Bertha Langille under this provision of the policy, in the amount of $140.00 per week for 129 weeks, having at first accepted the claim that she was employed at the time of the accident.
The defendant, after the 129 week period, cut off those payments, on medical grounds, but then came to believe that she had not been so employed.
The defendant has good reason to question the plaintiff’s evidence as to employment at the time of the accident.
The initial claim made to Guardian on behalf of Bertha Langille, was made by Vince Paris, while Bertha Langille was still hospitalized.","A motion for judicial review of a Labour Relations Board decision awarding a retroactive wage increase to employees.
The food services operators, alleging a denial of natural justice and procedural fairness, sought to have the orders set aside on the grounds the decisions were patently unreasonable in that the employer could not afford the wage increases and because retroactivity would not have been a feature of a replicated contract.
HELD: The motion was dismissed.
 1)In undertaking to replicate a collective bargaining agreement that the parties might have reached, the LRB concluded the contract in 14 months by which time the two year term contract had only three and one-half months to go.
The two year contract has now expired and the business has been sold.
To elevate this issue to a point where a rehearing would be required would seem counterproductive.
2)The LRB's actions fell well short of substantial compliance with the 45 day limit for review.
However at no time was the 'over 45 days' issue raised in the proceedings before the Board.
The test of 'substantial compliance' would involve a consideration of the purpose of the 45 day time limit and the probability of prejudice which might arise from a failure to comply.
The importance of a retroactive wage increase, which was substantial if viewed as a percentage, would seem prejudicial, even accepting the 45 day limit is directory.
The employer sought and obtained an adjournment of the hearing in April which effectively made compliance with the 45 day limit impossible as the employees left once they graduated from their university courses.
3)The errors were not so severe or so obvious as to meet the standard of patently unreasonable as defined by the courts (ie. clearly irrational (Federal Court of Appeal), outrageous, absurd, ridiculous, so beyond the bound of reason as to amount to fraud on the law or deliberate refusal to comply with it (Southam)).
4)The decision to allow employees, who had graduated and left their employment to receive back pay, was not of sufficient import to justify a finding of breach of natural justice.
Whether the Board breached natural justice and procedural fairness by awarding retroactive wages depends on whether the issue was one of the points of dispute between the parties.
To set aside the entire process because the retroactivity issue was not front and centre in the preliminary discussions would seem contrary to reason and curial deference.
Had the raise in pay not been retroactive it would, in light of the late decision, been rather meaningless.","[3, 0, 1, 6, 5, 7, 10, 8, 16, 20, 19, 21, 18]"

They were accompanied by persons in two other motor vehicles.

The other vehicle was operated by Craig Borgal.
[3] Following the motor vehicle accident the plaintiff, Cathy Hawes, was requested by attending police officers to undergo a breathalyser.
I find that the plaintiff, Cathy Hawes, consumed a very small amount of alcohol and that consumption was not a causative factor leading to the motor vehicle accident.

In proceeding to Lake Echo the plaintiff was driving directly through the intersection on a green light.

In that letter I stated: I would be prepared to meet with you and Mr. Leahey in Court and on the record to allow you the opportunity to express under oath any concerns you might wish to put forward regarding service.

The plaintiff claimed he was physically assaulted by employees and staff and suffered the loss of his traditional language and culture between 1944 and 1952 while attending the Qu'Appelle Residential School.
The AG acknowledged the plaintiff attended the school from 1946 until 1949.
The AG in a previous application was granted leave to amend its statement of defence and third party claim to plead and rely upon the Crown Liability and Proceedings Act; Limitations of Actions Act ss.31(d),(h) and (j); Public Officers' Protection Act; Trustee Act s.59, or its predecessor legislation Survival of Actions Act s.10; Crown Liability Act s.3(1)(a) and the Exchequer Court Act s.19.
A third party claim against the Oblats alleging they controlled and operated the residential school at all material times, was not relevant on this application.
HELD: 1)The claim based on physical assault by the Sisters was struck.
The Court has no jurisdiction over any cause of action relating to intentional torts committed by a Crown servant or employee prior to May 14, 1953.
The Crown remains immune from claims for trespass, assault and battery committed by servants and officers before the enactment of the Crown Liability Act in 1953 (renamed the Crown Liability and Proceedings Act in 1990), which did not operate retroactively.
The LAA s.3(3.1) does not create a cause of action but simply removes statutory time limitation periods barring otherwise existing actions.
Before May 14, 1953 the Crown was subject to claims for negligence pursuant to the Exchequer Court Act s.19(c).
The Dyson procedure is available in Canada in every jurisdiction except New Brunswick and Nova Scotia.
2)The claim based on negligence is subject to the two year time limitation prescribed by LAA s.3(1)(d) which must calculated having regard to the principles of discoverability.
3)The claims of breach of trust and breach of fiduciary duty are equitable claims subject to the six year time limitation in LAA ss.3(1)(h) which explicitly begins to run from the discovery of the cause of action (PG v. AG Canada).
Relevant factual issues are to be dealt with at trial.
4)Even though the claim in trespass is based on acts alleged to have occurred over 50 years ago, it clearly falls within the class of actions contemplated by LAA s.3(3.1)(b)(ii).
As such it is also exempted from any limitation period against others liable for the conduct.
5)The argument that the 12 month limitation period in POPA s.2(1)(a) should be applied in priority to the more general provisions of the LAAA was rejected in RJG v. AG Canada.
6)Claims based on direct liability of the Crown for negligence, breach of trust and fiduciary duty are not affected by time limitation periods applicable to the deceased Sister Greyeyes and her estate.
The time limitation periods are abrogated by LAA s.3(3.2).
Since there is no limitation period barring an action against the Sister or her estate, there can be no provincial limitation period available to the Federal Crown under CLPA s.24.
7)The other claims made directly against the Federal Crown are not affected by limitation periods applicable to Sister Elle or her estate.
SAA ss.5 and 10(1),(3) and (4) do not bar the claims against her.

The plaintiffs are policy holders of the defendant SMI.
This policy is not an issue in the action commenced by the plaintiffs and is not relied on for coverage in respect of the claim.
SMI is the insurer for the defendants and is involved in this claim by virtue of a policy of insurance with the defendants.
[2] The plaintiffs are farmers.
[3] The defendant farmers had insurance coverage for this type of loss and turned the claim over to SMI to be dealt with.
The plaintiffs then filed an amended claim adding SMI as a second defendant.
The basis of the claim against SMI is predicated on the fact that the plaintiffs also have a policy of insurance with SMI.
This policy of insurance does not cover the type of loss sustained by the plaintiffs, and the plaintiffs did, therefore, not seek coverage or indemnification from SMI on their policy of insurance.
The plaintiffs’ policy of insurance with SMI is not the subject of the court action and otherwise plays no part in these proceedings.
Paragraph 7 of the claim forms the nub of the action against SMI.","The Court was presented with a consent judgment.

The plaintiffs claimed they and their dependents were treated differently than non-native war veterans by requiring benefits to be administered by the Department of Indian Affairs or through Indian agents and claimed damages for loss of benefits based on systemic negligence, breach of trust, breach of fiduciary duty and unjust enrichment.
They alleged officials and Indian agents were negligent in carrying out their duties to inform the plaintiffs of their right to receive full and complete benefits and in some case agents misappropriated benefits.
HELD: The application was dismissed.
A class action is not the preferable procedure in the circumstances.
The issue of discoverability relating to each plaintiff overwhelms any common issues.
It is not possible to determine issues of discoverability in any global fashion.
It will be necessary to have an inquiry into the state of mind of each individual plaintiff over a period of 40 years.
Such a class action would be completely unmanageable and certification would result in a multitude of individual trials, which would completely override any advantage that might be derived from a trial of a few potential common issues.
A finding that there was a trust relationship between veterans and the Crown as to the administration of benefits would not determine whether there was a breach of any such relationship without an inquiry into the facts and circumstances of each veteran on a case by case basis.
Aside from limitation problems, individual determinations will be required in order to ascertain whether the individual has a cause of action including for breach of a fiduciary duty, if one existed, to properly inform each proposed plaintiff, what information each received, whether he understood the information and made an informed decision.

A ban on publication of evidence that may disclose the identity of the person under sixteen years of age has been made in this proceeding.
[2] The case involved alleged improper acts by the Accused with respect to her eight-year-old son, specifically massaging her in the nude on one or two occasions, while an adult male took photographs of the occurrence.
During these acts the Accused covered her breasts and vagina, in whole or part, and that her son did not touch her on those areas, but did so elsewhere, including on her buttocks.
The ITO did not allege the commission of the offence of sexual assault, or creation of child pornography, but only of invitation to sexual touching.
Further, it was alleged that upon arrest or detention the Accused person’s rights under section 10(b) were also infringed.
Notice was also given that the Defence wished to cross-examine the affiant who swore the ITO in detail on matters set out in the Notice.
The facts were expanded upon by viva voce evidence, and details are of significance in considering whether any breach of the Charter occurred.","The appellant was convicted of sexual assault, with the only live issue at trial being whether the Crown had proved the absence of the complainant's consent beyond a reasonable doubt.

The test for legal error in a judge alone case is not the same as would apply to a judge's charge to a jury on the issue of reasonable doubt.

F. Martinez, J [1] Jim Dallyn is charged with the offence of driving faster than 60 kilometres per hour when passing highway workers or occupied highway equipment within a work zone.

March 20, 2014Introduction[1] The applicant asks that the registration of a mortgage against land be discharged on the basis that the limitation period to enforce the mortgage has expired.
The respondent says the limitation period has not expired because The Saskatchewan Farm Security Act, S.S. 1988-89, c. S-17.1 (the “Farm Security Act”) provides for a suspension of limitation time running while certain proceedings are underway pursuant to that Farm Security Act.
[2] Whether the limitation period has expired or not depends on the proper interpretation to be given to the Farm Security Act and The Limitation of Actions Act, R.S.S.
1978, c. L-15 (the Limitations Act), which was the applicable limitation period legislation at the relevant times.
This issue and the interpretations in question have not previously been considered by this court.
The Facts[3] In 1981 Kenneth Roebuck mortgaged the subject land to the respondent to secure the repayment of a then $36,000 debt.
The respondent`s mortgage was registered at the Land Titles Office.
This registration continues to date as Interest Registration No.
It is agreed that this acknowledgement created a new limitation period running from that date.","The parties separated shortly after relocating from the United States to Nova Scotia.

Appeal and cross-appeal dismissed with the exception that the wife is to be given immediate access to her personal belongings; both applications to introduce fresh evidence dismissed;

140 - Were the contracts between Husky and the the third parties supply and install contracts?
151 - The manufacturing and processing cases 168 - Has there been a mistake of law in the payment of the PST by Husky?
The third party contractors collected the PST based on the invoices it charged to Husky and remitted it to the Saskatchewan Government.
Husky then commenced this claim.
1978, c. P-34.1 on June 27, 2000 (the “PST Act”).
[7] The Saskatchewan Government has joined the cementing contractors as third parties in this action.
PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND[10] Throughout the period of 1996 to 2001 (the claim period) Husky paid PST to the third party contractors on materials supplied by the third party contractors on the cementing contracts.
[15] Husky filed its statement of claim in this action on March 26, 2002.
It reduced the amount of the claim by eliminating its claim involving other contractors.
The third parties did not file any amended statement of defence to the amended third party claims.","The defendant obtained a tender to bank, blend and load coal at the plaintiff's coal preparation plant.
In performing the contract, the defendant experienced equipment problems resulting in the plaintiff having to rent other equipment.
The plaintiff terminated the contract without any prior warning or notice to the defendant and brought an action for reimbursement of monies advanced under the contract and expenses incurred for the equipment rentals.
The defendant counter-claimed for damages arising out of the termination of the contract, for services performed under the contract and for extras which had not been paid.
The court found that the plaintiff was entitled to reimbursement for overpayments and equipment rentals and that the defendant was entitled to fair and reasonable compensation for extras for which the court awarded the sum of $10,000.
Both parties were found to be in breach of the contract, the plaintiff's breach occurring because the volumes of coal supplied did not approximate the tonnages represented in the contractual documents.
The clause excluding liability for errors in the forecast did not excuse the plaintiff because the actual volumes were not even approximate to the forecasted tonnages and the rates bid by the defendant were directly related to the anticipated tonnages.
Absent evidence as to how the plaintiff arrived at the information used in the calculation of the forecasted tonnages, no negligent misrepresentation could be found, as there was no evidence that the information was negligently obtained.
Both parties appealed.
Appeal and cross-appeal dismissed;
the trial judge's finding that the defendant had fundamentally breached its contractual obligations which entitled the plaintiff to terminate the contract without notice should not be disturbed; thus, the trial judge did not err in awarding the plaintiff damages for the defendant's breach of contract.
The defendant did not establish that the plaintiff had been negligent in making the tonnage estimates and thus, the judge did not err in dismissing the defendant's claim for negligent misrepresentation.
Although the trial judge found that the plaintiff had also committed a fundamental breach of the contract (in failing to provide the approximate tonnages referred to in the contract), the defendant had not chosen to terminate the contract and the plaintiff's breach did not undermine its right to terminate the contract as a result of the defendant's breach.","[4, 7, 6, 49, 3, 5, 32, 44, 28, 54, 22, 38, 19]"

A report by Back-Track Investigations and Special Services Ltd. (Back-Track), filed in these proceedings as Exhibit P-1, supports Mr. Charbonneau’s belief that damage which occurred to their back yard lawn was caused by run-off and/or leaching of a substance from the back alley.

The employer spoke to the employee on three occasions about her work and by his own admission, the employee made an effort to improve.
At no time was she advised in any detail what was expected of her and that a failure to meet a particular standard could result in the termination of her employment.
It would appear that the employer attributed the misfiling of a paper in an income tax return to the plaintiff and he decided to summarily dismiss her.
In the circumstance, it can not be said that it is more probable than not that the plaintiff was guilty of serious misconduct or a breach of a fundamental nature respecting office policies, policies that may not have been made known to her, that there was just cause for her dismissal.
Therefore the defendant was dismissed without just cause.
 2) The contract of employment was a term contract extending from May to August 31, 2004.

The Commission appealed, arguing that the underlying judicial review application was improper and premature and thus, the procedural orders should not have been made.
Appeal allowed; the underlying judicial review application is stayed; the stay may be lifted by a judge of the Supreme Court on application with notice; the Order of the chambers judge on the procedural matters arising in that application is set aside.
The underlying judicial review application was premature because the Commission should have had the opportunity to consider and address the company president's complaints.

[1] Shirley Mae deBalinhard wishes to appeal from the decision of the chambers judge (indexed as 2014 SKQB 239 (CanLII)), made pursuant to s. 47 of The Queen’s Bench Act, 1998, SS 1998, c Q-1.01, not to vacate a certificate of pending litigation registered on behalf of her estranged husband, John Canagy deBalinhard, against title to certain lands.
[2] Mr. deBalinhard is deceased and his estate is represented by his executors.
Just prior to his death, Mr. deBalinhard filed a petition for the division of family property.
When he died, his solicitors filed the certificate of pending litigation.
Ms. deBalinhard subsequently transferred the lands into her own name and then entered into an agreement to sell them, which sale will not proceed until the certificate of pending litigation is vacated.
[3] When Ms. deBalinhard filed her notice of appeal, she did not consider whether the order appealed from was interlocutory or final in nature.
She subsequently filed a notice of motion seeking either leave to appeal or directions from a chambers judge that leave was not required.
(as he then was) in chambers)).","The plaintiff alleges the defendant has injured his reputation and feelings, and has caused the plaintiff humiliation and distress, through her actions as Reeve of the Council of the Rural Municipality of Sherwood.
The plaintiff claims general and aggravated damages of $5,000 for these injuries.
Both the plaintiff and the defendant were elected to their positions.
The plaintiff is a councillor.
The defendant determined that the plaintiff was in a conflict of interest and asked the plaintiff to remove himself from the Chambers pursuant to s. 45(1) of The Rural Municipality Act.
There was a further determination by the defendant that the plaintiff had misrepresented his situation to the council.
The defendant then prepared a letter to the plaintiff in which she advised that until such time as he apologized to council and remedied the 'deficiencies' that created the conflict of interest he would not be recognized by the chair to speak or to move motions.
HELD: The claim is dismissed.
1) Even if the defendant's decision did infringe on the plaintiff's Charter right to expression to some limited extent and could not be upheld pursuant to the section of The Rural Municipality Act (the Court made no conclusions as to which of the competing legal opinions is right) the Court was not prepared to award damages to the plaintiff pursuant to s. 24(1) of the Charter.
While the plaintiff's decision might have been politically advantageous to her and her supporters in council, it was not without some justification because the plaintiff was in breach of the Building Bylaw, there could be a perceived conflict of interest, and the Reeve did have some evidence before her that the plaintiff had misrepresented his situation to council.
The Court was not prepared to award damages to the plaintiff so he could gain a personal benefit from a limitation which only had a small effect on his right to represent his constituents.
The dispute between the parties is a political one.
A court should be reluctant to get involved.
2) With regard to the tort of misfeance in public office, even if the defendant acted without lawful authority in imposing the sanctions in order to be actionable, the defendant had to be aware that her conduct was unlawful.
This requirement has not been met.
The defendant was acting on legal advice from legal counsel to the municipality.
There is no evidence, nor even the suggestion, that legal counsel did not act in good faith in providing advice to the defendant.
As a result, the plaintiff has failed to establish that the defendant acted with knowledge she had no legal authority to do what she did in imposing sanctions on the plaintiff.
3) With respect to the tort of negligence, the Court found that because the defendant was acting on the advice of legal counsel when imposing the sanctions upon the plaintiff, she has not breached the standard of care.
Her actions were not negligent.","[3, 2, 7, 5, 4, 1, 8, 10, 6]"

The respondent father has applied to reduce his child support obligation and to extinguish arrears of child support as a result of him quitting his job and embarking on an apprenticeship program to become an electrician.
The petitioner mother has applied to become the sole custodian parent of the parties’ two daughters.
Both parties therefore seek to vary the existing court order regarding support and parenting.
[2] The order involved is a final order granted by Wilson J. at the conclusion of the pre-trial conference in this matter dated March 20, 2012.
The claim for support was initially made in the Petition pursuant to The Family Maintenance Act, 1997, S.S. 1997, c. F-6.2.
BACKGROUND FACTS[3] The parties have two children who are now eight and nine years of age.
The children reside with the petitioner and the respondent is to have reasonable access on reasonable notice.
It appears the respondent has not been exercising access and has had little involvement in the lives of the children.
[4] At the time the order was granted the respondent was found to be earning $75,000 per year.
At the end of August 2013 he voluntarily terminated his employment.","FIAT: The former vice-president of the Saskatchewan Labour Relations Board commenced an action for damages alleging wrongful conduct by the Government of Saskatchewan.
He alleges his term was not renewed through the influence of certain unions with the Department of Labour.
He participated in an interview where he suggested that the Department of Labour required members of the Board to read the newsletter of the Saskatchewan Federation of Labour.
When Wal-Mart became aware of these circumstances, it filed this application.
Wal-Mart alleges the Board is biased or, at the very least, there is justification for a reasonable apprehension of bias against Wal- Mart.
It argues that the only way to rectify the situation is to prohibit the Board from holding hearings involving Wal-Mart.
The Union applies pursuant to Rule 319 of the Queen's Bench Rules to strike almost all the material filed by Wal-Mart.
HELD: The application of Wal-Mart is dismissed.
The Union will have taxable costs, but only of the application by Wal-Mart and the Union's application to strike the material filed.
 1) The affidavit filed by Wal-Mart swears that the affiant has 'personal knowledge of the facts and matters herein deposed to' and then he goes on to swear that various exhibits are attached to his affidavit.
This achieves nothing more than compel the court to examine the exhibits to determine their admissibility.
The affiant does nothing more than provide copies of 27 documents.
2) There is no necessity for the admission of the documents.
There is no basis upon which to conclude that it is necessary to accept the proffered documents as evidence.
 3) It is alleged there was interference with the Board and that it was required to read publications which were highly disparaging of Wal-Mart.
Yet there is absolutely no evidence before the court to prove the allegations.
Many newsletters contain negative comments about Wal-Mart.
However, there is no admissible evidence to prove that these newsletters were provided to the Board, or that any member actually read them.
Mr. Matkowski has not come forward to assert his allegations under oath.
Without such evidence, it is impossible to conclude that bias exists within the Saskatchewan Labour Relations Board or that there is justification for a reasonable apprehension of bias.
To conclude otherwise, this court would be acting on pure conjecture or fantasy.
That is not good enough.","[2, 4, 0, 3, 6, 5, 9, 8, 7, 10, 12]"

The Arbitrator referred the matter back to the Board to consider the Tenure Appeals Committee decision as if the same had been transmitted to them by the president in accordance with the terms of the Agreement.
[2] The grounds of the University’s application are: 1.
The Arbitrator exceeded his jurisdiction, made an unreasonable decision, or committed an otherwise reviewable error of law by misinterpreting sections of The University of Saskatchewan Act, and in particular Section 51.
2.
...
The issue before the Arbitrator was whether a decision on tenure is an appointment within the meaning of s. 51(a) or a promotion within the meaning of s. 51(b).
The issues on this review are: (1) The standard of review applicable to the Arbitrator’s interpretation of s. 51; is it correctness or reasonableness?
(2) Does the interpretation of s. 51 by the Arbitrator meet the applicable standard of review?
BACKGROUND FACTS[4] The parties agreed to a lengthy statement of facts and the admissibility of a number of documents before the Arbitrator.
A summary of the facts set out in the arbitration decision follows.","The appellant appeals its conviction of selling tobacco to a minor contrary to s. 8(1) of the Tobacco Act.
The appellant argues that the learned trial judge erred in law by applying an unreasonably high standard of due diligence to the facts of the case.
HELD: The appeal is allowed, the conviction is quashed and a verdict of acquittal is entered.
 1) The court reviewed in detail the steps the appellant had in place.
2) The court was of the view that the trial judge erred in applying an unreasonably high standard for this defence.
The trial judge applied a standard of due diligence that required the appellant to be able to prove that there were no other possible precautions or action that could have been taken to prevent the company's cashiers from selling cigarettes.
This standard exceeds the requirements of a reasonable person.
By applying a higher standard of due diligence, the trial judge erred in law.

Application to amend the notice of appeal allowed;
the amendment is reasonably necessary for the presentation of the appeal and will not occasion prejudice to the respondent.
The respondent's opposition to the application fundamentally misconceived the role of a chambers judge who is asked to grant leave to amend a notice of appeal.
It is not the role of a chambers judge to rule on the substantive merits of the arguments the appellants wish to make.
The focus in this situation is on whether there is any prejudice to the respondent as a result of this issue being raised by amendment rather than in the original notice of appeal.","[2, 0, 1, 3, 9, 14]"
772,"IN THE PROVINCIAL COURT OF SASKATCHEWANCitation: 2014 SKPC 205Date: November 27, 2014 Information: 43842507 Location: Saskatoon Between:Her Majesty the Queen- and -D.R.
Appearing:Frank Impey For the Crown Lisa Watson For the Accused JUDGMENT S.L.
METIVIER, J I INTRODUCTION [1] The accused, D.R., is charged with sexual assault of the complainant, C.B., contrary to s. 271 of the Criminal Code.
The accused and complainant are related.
The charge arises from sexual activity that occurred between the accused and the complainant in December, 2012, in Saskatoon, Saskatchewan.
[2] The complainant says that she has no memory of the sexual activity due to an alcohol induced blackout.
The Crown argues that there was no consent.
The accused does not deny that he had sex with the complainant.
He claims that the activity was consensual or, alternatively, that he had an honest but mistaken belief in consent.
[3] The Crown called three witnesses: the complainant, C.B., her mother, F.B., and her uncle, R.B..
The accused testified and called two additional witnesses: M.R.
In order for an accused to be convicted of sexual assault, the Crown must prove beyond a reasonable doubt that they committed the actus reus (wrongful act) and that they had the necessary mens rea (mental intent).
The actus reus of the offence is unwanted sexual touching.","The accused was charged that he did drive while disqualified, contrary to s. 89(1) of The Highway Traffic Act, as it was then.
The issues were as follows: 1) should the offence of driving while disqualified contrary to the provincial statute be regarded as a full mens rea offence? 2) is the evidence sufficiently credible for the court to conclude that the accused had knowingly operated a motor vehicle while subject to a driving disqualification?
HELD: The accused is not guilty.
1) Driving while disqualified should be regarded as a full mens rea offence, rather than one of strict liability requiring the accused to establish due diligence on a balance of probabilities, given that the accused's liberty is jeopardized with the potential of incarceration.
Likewise the automatic disqualification and surrender of a driver's license are serious sanctions. 2)
The accused was adamant in asserting that he had no knowledge of his license suspension at the material time.
Although he was not able to offer a compelling explanation for ignoring the admonition to him in a letter from Saskatchewan Government Insurance (S.G.I.) of July 11, 2005 that if he consumed any alcohol, an original driving suspension would be reinstated, the accused believed it was appropriate to rely instead on the advice of the peace officer on December 18, 2005 that it was only a 24 hour suspension, unless he heard further from S.G.I. Likewise, it did not appear that the accused had any further communication from S.G.I. subsequent to December 18, 2005, until shortly after the motor vehicle accident, roughly 2 months later.
At that time, it was confirmed that the suspension had been extended to October 16, 2006, contrary to his earlier belief.
Apparently it is an important part of the S.G.I. administration of driver's license suspensions that there be communication by letter, as has occurred here twice, with the purpose of attempting to ensure accused persons are advised in writing of changes in the legal status of their driving suspensions, with clarity and precision.
As such, this accused should be able to rely on that procedure, even when that communication was not as timely as one would hope.
Not having heard from S.G.I. in the interim, after December 18, 2005, it was reasonable for him to rely on the advice received from the peace officer.
As such, the evidence is not sufficient to prove that the accused had knowingly operated a motor vehicle while disqualified as alleged, and he is not guilty.","[3, 1, 2, 5, 7, 6, 4, 0, 10, 8, 9, 13, 12]"
773,"The court’s direction on various aspects of the proposed order will assist both plaintiff’s counsel and the bar in general.
[2] The plaintiff applied for an order nisi for judicial sale of the property owned by the defendants.
The Limitation of Civil Rights Act, RSS 1978, c L-16 [LCRA] does not preclude the plaintiff from suing on the covenant because this is not a purchase-money mortgage.
However, judicial sale is required so that the plaintiff may apply to have the amount of deficiency in the judgment set by the court.
Otherwise, as provided by s. 6 of the LCRA, foreclosure of the mortgage operates as full satisfaction of that debt.
[3] The plaintiff applied by notice of application for the order nisi for judicial sale, with service upon both defendants.
Neither defendant appeared in court.
The plaintiff filed a draft order nisi for judicial sale in support of its application.
It is from this draft order that certain rulings and directions are now provided.
THE APPROPRIATE SELLING OFFICER [4] The draft order proposes that after the end of the redemption period, the mortgaged land be sold under the direction of the plaintiff’s lawyers, by way of listing the property for a period of ninety days with a licenced real estate agent.","FIAT: The accused applicant brings an application for a change in venue in this matter pursuant to s. 599(1) of the Criminal Code.
HELD: 1). The application for a change of venue is denied.
2) There is no evidence of a general prejudicial attitude in Saskatoon as a whole that would justify a change in venue.
There has been significant pre-trial publicity in this case from media reports of the case and other similar cases involving knives, as well as ongoing memorial reports.
However, the accused has not met the onus necessary to succeed on its application.
In other cases the existence of some memorial fundraising and memorials in the victim's names led the courts in those instances to grant a change in venue.
However, in allowing the application, the courts in those cases both referenced the relatively small size of the judicial centers in which the trials were to be held, thereby making it more than likely an impartial jury pool could not be found.
Saskatoon is not a small judicial centre.
It is more populated than the Prince Albert judicial district to where the accused requests the case be transferred and is much larger than the judicial district of Humboldt, which might also be considered.","[2, 1, 4, 3, 6, 5, 8, 7, 9, 10]"
774,"Original judgment has been corrected with text of corrigendum appended.
As is more fully explained below, the extraordinary feature of this appeal is that the trial which resulted in Mr. Lundrigan’s conviction – which was held March 22, 2012 – was the third trial of this charge.
For the reasons that follow, I have decided to allow Mr. Lundrigan’s appeal, and, rather than ordering a fourth trial, to stay the proceedings.
BACKGROUND: PRIOR PROCEEDINGS [2] This appeal relates to the decision of the trial decision, which is reported at 2012 SKPC 129 (CanLII), 402 Sask R 236 [the trial decision].
The trial judge there describes the history of this prosecution, as follows: 2 The facts of the case are unremarkable.
The learned trial judge at the time accepted that argument and acquitted the accused.
The amendments to s. 258 of the Criminal Code made it much more difficult to establish that defence.
5 These three things would have to be established by the defendant in addition to his evidence of consumption being accepted as true by the trier of fact.
6 The matter proceeded to trial before His Honour Judge Green on that basis.
There was viva voce evidence at the third trial from the appellant, and from Cpl.","FIAT: The applicants are residents of Wilcox and have children attending the Wilcox school.
They seek an interlocutory mandatory injunction preventing the respondent Board of Education from acting upon a resolution that the Wilcox school be closed.
HELD: Both with respect to the statutory breach of the 28-day notice period for the meeting to elect school community council members, and the ground of lack of procedural fairness, the Court concluded the applicants failed to meet the standard of a strong prima facie case.
1) A review of the facts and the law suggest that the applicant's submission on the fact that the notice for election of the school community council was 2 days short of the 28 days required by The Education Act does not meet the test of a strong prima facie case.
The Act does not state that non-compliance with formalities will result in a nullity.
There was no prejudice caused by the non-compliance with the 28-day notice period before the election of members to the school community council.
There is no evidence or suggestion that a different school council would have been elected if the extra 2 days notice had been provided.
No one complained at the time and the fact the matter is raised now amounts to a collateral attack on that election.
The potential consequences of a Court finding of a nullity militate against such a finding.
The relevance of the school community council in the closure of a school arises after the decision to close the school has been made.
To nullify all of the process and consultation that went into the school closure on this collateral ground would have serious consequences of causing at least one year delay in the efficiencies or improvements in student education which motivated the decision, and result in a loss of time, energy and money expended in the process.
2) Taking into account the mandate of the Board under the Act with respect to school closures, the consultation process adopted by the Board, and the manner in which it conducted the consultation meetings does not lead to the conclusion the procedure was unfair.
A review of the five factors identified by the Supreme Court in Baker v. Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration) does not favour an overly stringent application of the procedural fairness rules in this matter.","[1, 9, 24, 6, 13, 8, 33, 19, 21, 5]"
775,"for Katherine Anne Jensen and Kristine Elizabeth Szwagierczak FIAT ELSON J.
May 13, 2015[1] Steven Szwagierczak was a widower when he died on April 10, 2014.
Later that same day, Mr. Szwagierczak met with a lawyer and purportedly instructed her to prepare his Last Will and Testament.
According to the evidence, the instructions were principally based on revisions to a previous will the same lawyer had prepared for him in 2012.
[2] In this application, one of Mr. Szwagierczak’s five daughters seeks an order directing a trial to prove the 2013 will in solemn form.
The grounds asserted by the applicant, are that, at the time of making his will, Mr. Szwagierczak did not have testamentary capacity to understand the nature of the document he was signing or the extent of his property.
[3] For the reasons that follow in this fiat, I am satisfied that the applicant has not made out a genuine issue for a trial to prove the will in solemn form.
Accordingly, the application must be dismissed.
[5] Although the court was not provided with information as to the date of their marriage, it is evident that Steven and Betty Szwagierczak were married for many years.
The evidence also suggests that this couple was very close.
There is little doubt that he was grief stricken when she eventually passed.
[6] When Mr. Szwagierczak died, he had five adult daughters.","FIAT: The plaintiff applies for orders requiring the defendant and third parties to answer questions and respond to undertakings arising from the examinations for discovery in this action pursuant to Rules 222, 231 and 232 of the Queen's Bench Rules and an order requiring the third parties to provide further and better disclosure of documents in their power pursuant to Rules 212 and 215.
HELD: 1) A party to litigation cannot decline to answer questions on an examination for discovery that are intended to elicit the facts on which that party has based its pleading.
A party is required to divulge the facts that it has now or admit that it has none if such is the case.
The defendant is obligated to provide its responses to the undertakings before the examination for discovery of its proper officer is concluded so that he can be further examined on the responses.
If the position of the defendant as set forth in those responses changes as a result of after acquired information, the defendant shall so inform the plaintiff by way of supplemental responses within 90 days following the completion of the defendant's examinations for discovery of the third parties.
If it is necessary for the plaintiff to further examine for discovery on the defendant's responses or supplemental responses, the defendant's proper officer shall attend such examination for discovery.
2) The material filed satisfies the Court that PSAC documents relating to the PST issue are at least broadly relevant to the issues and that BJ Services likely has the power to obtain and produce them.
The fact that BJ Services may intend to claim a litigation privilege over the documents, or that PSAC may not produce them, does not relieve BJ Services of the obligation to disclose their existence.
BJ Services shall provide further and better disclosure of documents by providing a detailed list of documents referred to in the second part of the second schedule of its statement as to documents.
If a claim for privilege is asserted over such documents, BJ Services shall identify the basis of such claim, the date of the documents, the name of the sender and the names of the recipients.","[1, 7, 5, 10, 4, 13, 2, 12, 9, 15, 16, 8]"

[1] Stan Sheppard’s company, 6517633 Canada Ltd. [the Company], sued Knudsen & Sons Muddy View Ranch Ltd. [Knudsen] for breaching a contract whereby the Company had agreed to custom seed some 1,050 acres for Knudsen in exchange for a fixed price of $19,293.75.
[2] The essential facts are relatively straightforward.
In broad-brush terms, they are as follows.
The contract in question was signed on May 29, 2014.
The next evening, Gene Knudsen telephoned Mr. Sheppard to ask if he was prepared to do only a portion of the seeding and to “seed along side us”.
Mr. Sheppard made it clear that he considered this to be a breach of the contract but said he would think about it.
At around noon the next day, May 31, Mr. Sheppard called Gene Knudsen back and said he was not prepared to comprise his position.","The appellant agreed to buy a two-story condominium unit from the respondent developer.
The building permit had not been obtained, nor had condominium titles been raised at the time the sale agreement was entered into.
In the course of construction the respondent opted not to proceed with the two-story unit, revising it to a single story unit which was offered to the appellant.
The appellant did not accept the offer, and registered a miscellaneous interest against the title to the entire parcel of land.
The appellant sues for specific performance of the agreement and in the alternative, damages.
The developer succeeded in obtaining a court order discharging the miscellaneous interest.
The Court's jurisdiction to hear the appeal is found in s. 111 of The Land Titles Act, 2000.
The issue is whether the appellant possessed an interest in land so as to support the registration of a miscellaneous interest.
HELD: Appeal dismissed.
 1) Before a condominium plan as defined in The Condominium Property Act, 1993 comes into being, there is nothing in the Act which directly or inferentially entertains the prospect that a purchase of a 'proposed unit' can constitute an interest in land, or a registrable interest for the purposes of s. 50 of The Land Titles Act, 2000. 2)
The Act expressly prohibits the registration of any charge against the common property.
The appellant is not entitled to rest his claim to a registrable interest in the surface parcel on the basis of a notional claim to rights in 'common property'.
Common property, by definition, does not come into existence until the condominium plan comes into effect.
3) For the purposes of s. 50 of The Land Titles Act, 2000, the appellant had no basis in law, or under The Condominium Property Act, 1993 for asserting an interest against the surface parcel owned by the respondent.","[3, 2, 1, 4, 5, 0, 7, 8, 6]"

[3] Ms. Cummings filed a notice of appeal, appealing his decision to this Court, on December 20, 2010.
On January 11, 2011, she filed an amended notice of appeal and, on April 15, filed a motion for date and directions, seeking dates and an order “compelling the Crown to absorb the cost of transcript certification”.
On April 18, she filed a motion for fresh evidence.
Ms. Cummings was directed to file the appeal book and her fresh evidence by June 22 and her factum by July 22.","At issue was retroactive maintenance for the now 16-year-old for a period of time pre-dating the mother's application (in 2007).
Although the parties separated in 2001, there was no written agreement/order in place until 2009.
The father paid support voluntarily, at an amount that was increased over the years.
The mother said the father controlled the amount and knew it was below his table obligation under the Guidelines.
She claimed she did not know his true income, and that every time she asked for additional assistance (such as a contribution to extraordinary expenses) he told her he could not afford it.
The father said he was unaware of the correct table amount, and that he paid according to the mother's demands.
Retroactive support awarded according to the table amount from 2005 onward.
The father's hardship arguments rejected.
He was aware from the outset that his child support obligation was related to his income.
The dramatic increase to his income, and his failure to disclose it to the mother in 2005 constituted sufficient/effective notice that his payments were now deficient.
Claim for retroactive s. 7 (extraordinary or special) expenses for the same time-period denied.
The father did, on occasion voluntarily contribute to these expenses.
During the relevant period of time, the parents spent some time trying to reconcile and acting as a family.","[1, 9, 7, 6, 8, 11, 13, 10, 2]"
779,"Background[2] I take the background facts from Justice John Murphy’s decision that is under appeal (2011 NSSC 484 (CanLII)).
[3] The Sydney Steel Works opened in 1903 and operated coke ovens and a steel plant.
They claim that the Steel Works’ facilities emitted lead, arsenic, PAH’s and other toxins.
They sue in tort and for breach of fiduciary duty, and seek damages for their own exposure and for injury to their property and its value.
The lawsuit began in 2004.
Some claims against private entities were settled or abandoned.
The remaining claims are against the Governments of Nova Scotia and Canada, and relate to the period between 1967 and 2000.
[4] In September 2007, the plaintiffs filed a notice seeking certification as a common law class proceeding.
After the Class Proceedings Act, S.N.S.
2007, c. 28 (Act), came into force, the matter was continued under that Act.
The defendants have not filed a notice of defence; pursuant to section 4(6) of the Act they are not required to do so until 45 days after certification order is issued, and the court dismissed a plaintiffs' motion seeking earlier filing.
Nevertheless, the defendants have demonstrated the intention to dispute all aspects of the claim.","The three respondents pled guilty to three offences: trafficking in cocaine for the benefit of, or at the direction of, or in association with a criminal organization contrary to s. 467.12 of the Criminal Code; conspiring together and with others to traffic in cocaine contrary to s. 5(1) of the Controlled Drugs and Substances Act and s. 465(1)(c) of the Criminal Code; and trafficking in cocaine contrary to s. 5(1) of the Controlled Drugs and Substances Act.
On the last two counts, each was sentenced to 1 year less a day to be served in the community on each count, to be served concurrently, plus a 10 year fire arms prohibition.
On the first count, each was sentenced to serve 1 year, in the community, consecutive to the sentences for the other counts.
They were also subjected to DNA orders and there was an order of forfeiture of a vehicle belonging to a third party.
The Crown appealed these sentences on the grounds that the sentencing judge failed to give proper effect to the gravity of these offences.
The Court weighed all the evidence and circumstances of the accused, and found the sentencing judge was clearly moved by the personal circumstances of the accused and while they are mitigating and would normally justify a sentence at the low end of the range, it was the Court's view that the sentencing judge gave them undue weight in comparison to the principles of denunciation and general deterrence, which must play a significant role in offences of this nature.
The Court further stated the 1 year sentence for the trafficking offence, to be served in the community, was demonstrably unfit given the range of sentences established in other cases of trafficking offences, even after taking into account the mitigating personal circumstances of these offenders.
The Court found the sentences must be set aside.
The Court found that an appropriate sentence for each of the respondents, taking into account the seriousness of the offences, the personal circumstances of the respondents, and the aggravating nature of the offences pursuant to s. 467.12, would be 18 months, concurrent, for each of the last two counts, and 1 year consecutive for the criminal organization offence, for a total of 30 months imprisonment.
HELD: The total sentence in each case is 30 months, 5 months having already been served.","[1, 7, 5, 6, 8, 11, 13, 4, 16, 2, 12, 15]"

405823 Registry: Pictou Between: 3008361 Nova Scotia Limited Plaintiff v.Scotia Recycling Limited DefendantRevised Decision: The text of the original decision has been corrected according to the appended erratum dated September 30, 2013.
Judge: The Honourable Justice N. M. Scaravelli.
[2] By way of background the defendant, Scotia Recycling Limited operated out of a leased premises in the plaintiff’s building in Stellarton, Industrial Park.
The defendant was in the business of sorting and baling facility for recycled materials they collected from households.
The building was damaged by fire on October 22, 2007.
The plaintiff commenced an action against the defendant seeking damages, alleging negligence.
After the fire the defendant moved to another location.
In May of 2009 another fire occurred at the defendant’s location resulting in destruction of that building.
[3] The Plaintiff seeks production of all documents relating to the second fire.
Specifically:a.
A complete copy of any investigative files prepared by government authorities including but not limited to the Fire Marshall and the Town of Stellarton Fire Department;b.
[4] The Defendant submits the Plaintiff has not established the documents are relevant to the present action.","The accused, Chisum Log Homes and its sole director Gary Varga, are charged with operating a processing facility without a licence contrary to s. 18.1(1) of The Forest Resources Management Act.
The accused corporation assembles log home packages.
The packages are sold to customers across Canada.
The accused corporation buys wood from area operators such as L&amp;M to be used in its packages.
L&amp;M through its contractor P&amp;E, harvest wood from the forest and sell the wood to pulp mills, saw mills and other customers such as the accused.
These area operators and their contractors have Forest Management Agreements and Forest Product Processing Facility Licences.
In August and September 2007, the area operator L&amp;M delivered logs to the accused.
The accused took additional steps to prepare the logs for inclusion in their log home packages which they sold.
The accused does not have a Forest Product Processing Facility Licence.
The issue in this case is whether the Crown has shown that the accused requires such a licence.
HELD: 1)
The definition of 'manufacture' in the Act is extremely broad as it says, 'means any step taken'.
Given this definition is not difficult to find based on the evidence presented that the steps taken by the contractor in cutting the logs is more than simply harvesting as it is defined in the legislation.
See R. v. Provincial Forest Products, 2000 SKQB 371.
2) The Court is satisfied that the accused corporation, Chisum, took steps to manufacture the forest product for the log home market.
Steps such as debarking were steps taken in the manufacture of a forest product for market.
 3) Given the wide definition it is the Court's view that many facilities, including a retail lumberyard, could be captured within the definition.
Given the stated purpose of the Act, it is appropriate that the requirement for a Processing Facility Licence be restricted so that it does not apply to every entity that manufactures a forest product. 4)
The processes Chisum is involved in encompass the substantial conversion of the forest product into logs to be used in the log home industry.
The process is not insignificant, nor is it a process which is removed from the sustainable use of forest lands and the need to maintain and enhance the health of forest lands.
The Court concludes that Chisum was required to have a Processing Facility Licence.
5) Pursuant to s. 81 of the Act, Gary Varga, as President of Chisum, is also guilty of violating s. 18.1 of the Act.","[0, 2, 1, 4, 5, 7, 8, 10, 6, 9, 11, 12, 14]"
781,"158 APPLICANT - and -GREGORY GEORGE SCHMIDTRESPONDENTCounsel: D. Neil Robertson, Q.C.
158 [RM] was granted an order [Court Order] requiring the respondent, Gregory George Schmidt [Mr. Schmidt] to comply, within 60 days, with the order of the Development Officer of the RM dated February 3, 2014 [RM Order].
The RM Order was made pursuant to s. 242 of The Planning and Development Act, 2007, SS 2007, c P-13.2 [Act].
In particular, it required Mr. Schmidt to desist from operating an equipment storage yard on Parcel A and to restore Parcel A “to the condition it was in immediately prior to undertaking the development”.
[2] The court record shows that Mr. Schmidt was personally present in Chambers on May 15, 2014 when the Court Order was granted.
Nevertheless, he took no significant steps to comply with the RM Order within the time stipulated therein.
On August 19, 2014, the RM then applied for an order declaring Mr. Schmidt to be in contempt of court for his continued failure to comply with the RM Order as directed by the Court Order.
[3] The contempt application was initially heard September 25, 2014.
At some time prior, Mr. Schmidt engaged counsel and filed an affidavit in response to the application.
In paragraphs 7, 8 and 9 of his affidavit sworn September 22, 2014 he states: 7.","The Ministry seeks an order under s. 37(2) which is a permanent committal and is a precursor to the boys Michael and David being placed for adoption.
Art and Laura, the maternal grandparents oppose the application and want the boys returned to their care.
The mother, Melody, supported her parent's application for custody.
HELD: The boys are in need of protection and there is an order placing the boys in the permanent care of the Minister.
As long as the boys are in foster care, the Ministry will make arrangements for the boys to have regular access to their mother and to Art and Laura.
 1) There is no doubt but that Art and Laura love and wish the best for the boys.
However, there are real concerns about Art and Laura' familial context.
There is the fact that Art and Laura's own children were apprehended in 1989 and committed to the Minister.
It is pertinent to note Art and Laura are estranged from four of their six children.
 Two of Art's children claim he sexually assaulted them.
When Melody testified she said her first preference was that the boys be placed with Mary Stevens, their foster parent, but did acknowledge that the boys would be in good hands with Art and Laura.
2) While the Court accepts that the Stevens home is a positive and nurturing one, there is no question it is not an ideal physical place for 9 people.
With organization, routine and discipline however, it can function at a satisfactory level.
Further, if an order is made under s. 37(2), the boys have the opportunity to be adopted.
The Court cannot lightly preclude that possibility.","[1, 4, 7, 8, 10, 3, 14, 11, 9, 6]"

[2] Turcotte J. ordered retroactive child support for the period from January 1, 2009, to August 31, 2012, inclusive.
II.
Background [3] By way of background, Daniel Prescesky and Mandy Schmidt were married on November 4, 1995.
[4] They were able to settle their differences at the outset of their break-up.
On June 29, 2006, Kreuger J. issued a Consent Divorce Judgment ordering that the parties shall have joint custody of the children who will live with the mother.
On the same day, Kreuger J. also issued a Consent Child Support Order [2006 Consent Child Support Order].
The relevant terms of that order are as follows: 3.
4.
The Petitioner and the Respondent intend that child support payable in clause 3 above shall include any babysitting expenses incurred by either party.
5.
On or before June 1 in each year the parties shall exchange T-4 Slips, Tax Returns and Notices of Assessment.
The parties agree that they will endeavor to adjust from year to year, the amount of child support payable to reflect the amount payable pursuant to the Federal Child Support Guidelines.
1–2) It should be noted that clause 5 of the 2006 Consent Child Support Order requires the parties to exchange financial information and to endeavour to make adjustments, but it does not specify the effective date of any such adjustments.","FIAT: The respondent mother filed a motion asking for an order quantifying child support arrears which she claims are due and owing pursuant to the order of Gunn, J. in September, 2008.
She also asks that the Court determine the ongoing child support amount to be paid by the petitioner father.
The Court questioned whether this application was more in the nature of a variation of the Gunn, J. order.
It is clear that there has been a change since September 2008 with respect to the residency of one of the children.HELD: 1)
The father's unusual 2008 taxation year has led to the parties taking very different positions as to how the father's income should be calculated.
The father argues that it would be appropriate to average the father's income for 2006 to 2008.
The mother argues that his income is the sum set out on line 150 of his tax return.
She argues that his total income is the sum of $302,196 for the 2008 year.
The father's argument is that the severance he received in 2008 should not be included in his income.
It is well established that severance pay represents an acceleration of income that would have been paid over a period of months.
It is also well established that income for the basis of calculating child support should be determined on the basis of severance pay plus whatever other earnings the payor may have.
The severance is included as part of the father's income.
2) The capital gain which shows on the father's 2008 income tax return shall not be included in his 2008 income.
The father agreed as part of the distribution of family income to assume responsibility for the capital gain on the real estate he was receiving as part of the family property division.
The gain does not reflect income actually received by the father and there will be no 'year to year' capital gains.
See Andersen v. Andersen (1997), 32 R.F.L. (4th) 177.
3) The father's income for 2008 is $270,300.
 4) If the parties were to proceed in accordance with their own agreement and consent order, the father would be forced to pay on his inflated 2008 income.
However, the mother would then be forced to pay back to the father the overpayment.
As of May 2009 the father's income is the sum of $160,000. 5)
The mother shall have her costs of $600.","[4, 12, 2, 13, 6, 16, 21, 18, 11, 15, 7, 10, 17, 19]"

Relief granted;
to require the bankrupt to discharge the loans in a reasonable manner would require an additional 10 or more years on top of the 13 years with which she had already been burdened, and to expect her to pay in a shorter period would cause her continuing financial difficulties.

They both received a damage settlement from, and signed releases in favour of, the vehicle's owner and his insurance company ('Citadel').
More than five years later, they brought this action against the car's manufacturer (the defendant, GMCL), claiming the accident was caused by an inherent flaw in the vehicle's design and seeking further damages.
GMCL moved for summary judgement on the pleadings in relation to Steven and Jody Johansson, on the basis of the releases.
They indicated that, should this matter proceed to trial, they would be joining Citadel as a third party.
Motion granted; Steven and Jody Johansson's claims dismissed.
There are no genuine issues for trial; the only facts in dispute relate to Mary Johansson.
The releases were clear and unambiguous.
Although neither plaintiff had the benefit of independent legal advice when signing, they both accepted payment in full and final settlement of any damages arising from the accident.
They should not now expect to recover further compensation, especially where pursuing the claim will result in a claim for contribution or indemnity against Citadel.
While GMCL was not a party to the release, the release did contemplate third parties being covered insofar as those third parties 'might claim contribution or indemnity'.
Both conditions from the SCC case of Fraser River [1999] have been met: the parties to the contract (Citadel and the plaintiffs) intended to extend the benefit in question to the third party seeking to rely on it; and the very activities concerned are those contemplated as coming within the scope of the contract in general.
GMCL should be entitled to use the releases to defend the action brought by these plaintiffs.
To allow the action to proceed would be an abuse of the court's process.","[1, 2, 3, 4, 8, 17, 18, 10, 15, 7, 5, 6, 21, 13]"

The arrears which will exist as of the date of this order are payable at the rate of $500.00 per month; 6.

The accused was grossly lacking in mental abilities, had limited and basic comprehension, had the mental capacity of a young child and these facts were not likely to change anytime soon.

Introduction [1] The respondent, Robert Kenneth Power (Constable Power), a member of the Regina City Police Service, effected an arrest of Edward Stonechild in the process of which he push-kicked Mr. Stonechild in the abdomen causing Mr. Stonechild to fall backwards and injure his head.
Constable Power was charged and convicted in the Provincial Court with committing an assault causing bodily harm on Mr. Stonechild contrary to s. 267(b) of the Criminal Code.
Constable Power appealed his conviction to the Court of Queen’s Bench sitting as a summary conviction appeal court.
The summary conviction appeal court judge (appeal court judge) determined that the Provincial Court judge had erred in finding Constable Power guilty, set aside the conviction and entered an acquittal (appeal decision).
[2] The Crown now applies for leave to appeal the decision of the summary conviction appeal court pursuant to s. 839 of the Criminal Code.
For the reasons hereinafter set forth, leave is granted, the appeal is allowed and the conviction of Constable Power entered in the Provincial Court is reinstated.

Facts and Background [3] Mr. Stonechild was a homeless man.
[4] Constable Power was 6’1” in height and, at the time of the offence, weighed approximately 215 pounds and was in good physical condition.

At issue was the accused's sentence.
The Crown sought a global sentence of 5 years plus a forfeiture order of items seized, a fine in lieu of forfeiture for all cash used for legal fees, a mandatory weapons prohibition and sought bodily substances for DNA analysis.
As the accused had been denied bail and had pre- trial detention of 15 months and 24 days, the defence sought one and one-half times credit for time served on remand.HELD: The accused had 9 prior drug convictions since 1999, two for trafficking in 2000 for which he received a 12 month sentence of incarceration and, in 2007, one trafficking and conspiracy to traffic which resulted in his receiving a 5 year penitentiary sentence.
As the accused had been a compliant prisoner on remand, the Court granted him credit for 1.5 days for each day spent on remand for a total of 23 months and 21 days credit.
The Court imposed a sentence of 30 months imprisonment, and ordered a DNA sample as well as a fine in lieu of forfeiture in the sum of $16,326 (being the sum transferred to the accused's legal counsel to pay his legal fees) to be paid within 60 days and, in default of payment, a term of imprisonment of 6 months consecutive to the term of imprisonment otherwise imposed.","[3, 6, 8, 9, 18, 10, 7, 5, 2, 21, 11, 22, 4]"

I.
Introduction [1] The appellant, Dennis Lawson, applies pursuant to Rule 15 of The Court of Appeal Rules for an order staying execution of spousal support arrears created as a result of an interim order.
That interim order provided ongoing spousal support for Mr. Lawson’s wife, the respondent, Tamara Rees, in the amount of $10,000 per month; gave Ms. Rees exclusive possession of the family home; provided for shared parenting of their son and awarded child support to Ms. Rees of $2,726 per month.
Mr. Lawson has appealed only those portions of the interim order relating to spousal support and exclusive possession of the family home.
He has made all of the payments required by the order, except for the spousal support arrears.
Ms. Rees has filed garnishees to collect those arrears.
II.
background [2] The order for spousal support was made in the face of a written agreement, pursuant to which Ms. Rees gave up her rights to spousal support.",", motion denied.
While the province has an arguable appeal, it does not concern a summary judgment motion that would result in the claims being dismissed outright.
If the certification order is struck, the province will still face individual claims.
The AG has not shown that defending individual actions will cost less than defending one class proceeding.
There is no evidence to estimate how it may incur significantly higher expenses as a result of how the points at issue in the appeal are resolved.
The matter has been ongoing for some time and it is reasonable to expect the province has already spent time and money to prepare the defence they will eventually file.
To succeed on this basis, the court would require a reliable indication of what remains to be done during the stay period, what component of that residue would be wasted if the appeal is allowed, and some estimate of that cost.","[2, 5, 1, 3, 4, 6, 7, 8, 9]"
789,"QUEEN’S BENCH FOR SASKATCHEWAN Citation: 2015 SKQB 412 Date: 2015 10 06 Docket: QBG 309 of 2015 Judicial Centre: ReginaBETWEEN:COWESSESS INDIAN BAND NO.
73 PLAINTIFF - and -BRABANT AND COMPANY LAW OFFICE DEFENDANTS Counsel:Nathan Phillips for the plaintiff T. Joshua Morrison for the defendantsFIAT BROWN J. OCTOBER 6, 2015 Introduction [1] The applicant, Cowessess Indian Band No.
The application proceeded on March 12, 2015.
[2] For the reasons that follow, I dismiss the application.
Background [3] Brabant is in essence Alan Brabant, a sole practitioner, who provided legal services to Cowessess over a 23 year period, beginning in 1992.
The services were in relation to various matters of concern to Cowessess and could be described as being both the provision of general counsel advice and specific legal services on discrete files of a corporate, commercial or litigation nature.
[4] No formal written retainer was executed between Brabant and Cowessess, rather the relationship proceeded on verbal terms and a mutual understanding.
Services were requested and provided, bills for those services were rendered periodically and were in due course paid by Cowessess, at least until somewhat more recently.
One of the issues still being litigated is whether the current Chief is lawfully entitled to the position.
This in turn led to this application which Brabant opposes.
67(1)(a)(i) of the Act which establishes an assessment as a matter of right.","The accused was charged with numerous weapons-related offences, including possession and trafficking.
The police had intercepted numerous ambiguous calls between the accused and others and had interpreted the coded language used as involving discussions about firearms.
The defence had been unsuccessful in arguing that the inferences drawn were mere hunches and the conversations could not support a reasonable inference that the subjects under discussion were firearms.
A search at his parents' residence had resulted in the seizure of several firearms but none were found in the accused's actual possession.
One of the issues was whether the accused had constructive or joint possession of the firearms seized from his parents.
Accused found guilty on all the weapons' possession charges and some of the trafficking charges, but not guilty of careless storage of a firearm.
It was clear that the accused had much more than a passive or quiescent knowledge of the guns seized from his parents' home and there were a number of indicators that he had a measure of control over them, such as his telling his father on occasion to get rid of them, his being notified immediately when one of the firearms went missing, the way he pressed his parents to explain how that could happen and his ability on other occasions to tell his father where in the home a particular firearm was located.
However, despite his knowledge of the location of some of the firearms at certain times, the court was unable to find that the accused had stored the firearms in the manner they were found when the search warrant was executed.
The evidence also established that he was stashing guns at locations other than his residence and he possessed those guns for the purpose of transferring them to others.
The only reasonable inference to be drawn from the intercepts was that the speakers were talking about guns and the communications revealed the commercial nature of the accused's activities.
Given that the accused had asserted a privacy interest with respect to an application to exclude the evidence arising from the police search of the cell phone seized from him, he could not now deny that the phone was his.","[4, 5, 3, 8, 9, 22, 19, 1, 14, 0, 6]"
790,"PETITIONER - and -D.W.S.
There have been a variety of applications to the court, court orders, and unsuccessful pre-trial settlement conferences.
[2] This application raises, once again, the question of a parenting plan for the children.
Concurrently with the filing of the Petition, the petitioner applied for interim orders dealing with, inter alia, the parenting of the children, child and spousal support, exclusive possession of the family home, and a division of family property.
Order dated September 28, 2010 (Dawson J.)
[4] On September 28, 2010, Dawson J. issued a fiat addressing some of the issues in dispute.
In doing so, she observed that “this file is an example of how quickly matters can escalate between two parties when cooler heads fail to prevail”.
[5] Dawson J. then made an interim order as follows: 1.
The petitioner and respondent shall have interim joint custody of the children of the marriage.
The children’s primary interim residence shall be with the petitioner.
The respondent is prohibited from entering the said home until further order.
… The petitioner and respondent shall each immediately register in the Parenting After Separation Course and each shall immediately file a Certificate of Registration with respect to the same.","The parties agreed on discovery dates and the order in which witnesses would be discovered.
As a result of an honest error, the defendant wasn't able to attend the original dates.
The plaintiff became frustrated and concerned about further delays.
While the defendant was making good faith efforts to resolve the discovery issues (including whether its witnesses should be excluded from attending discovery of the plaintiff's witnesses), the plaintiff's lawyer issued discovery subpoenas to compel the defendant's witnesses to appear, making the exclusion issue moot.
The defendant moved to have the subpoenas dismissed, and sought solicitor and client costs on the motion.
The defendant argued the subpoenas were improper and an abuse of process, and accused the plaintiff's lawyer of making unwarranted attacks against the defendant's lawyer in his pre-hearing brief.
The motion was heard over approximately one-half day.
Motion granted.
The plaintiff will pay total costs of $2,550 (plus disbursements) to the defendant, consisting of $1,500 in party and party costs under Tariff C and $1,050 in solicitor and client costs.
The tariff amount of $1,000 is increased by $500 to reflect the fact the issuance of the subpoenas was an improper step, albeit one falling short of an abuse of process.
It required the defendant to bring this motion to strike.
The plaintiff was given a chance to withdraw the subpoenas and chose not to.
Solicitor and client costs were warranted especially in light of the defendant's lawyer's language, which was unduly harsh and unnecessarily strong.
His allegations added a layer of complexity and seriousness to the case, which caused the defendant to spend extra time preparing a response.
Lawyers are officers of the court and the court must encourage them to use courtesy, respect and professionalism.","[6, 1, 10, 5, 14, 15, 11, 17, 9, 20, 21, 12]"
791,"MAY 2, 2016INTRODUCTION [1] The Ministry seeks a permanent wardship order with respect to two children.
The parents of the children, despite being more or less involved with the proceedings for some of the period of time, did not appear for the trial of the action.
While this failure to show was unfortunate, it does not change the obligation of the court with respect to the decision to be made.
Accordingly, the Ministry presented its evidence completely and provided full and complete argument in support of its recommendation in this matter.
Similarly, counsel for the children participated fully in the trial process and presented argument in advocating for the interests of the children.
[2] Decisions like those the court is called upon to make in this case are difficult.
This confluence is present not necessarily through the fault of the principal actors.
Rather, it is present because circumstances dictate it to be so.
[3] While happy is not a word often seen in these judgments, happily that confluence did not occur here.
The children have proven resilient.
The right child protection team was put in place and remained in place.
The right professional assistance was sought out and remained committed to these children.","The plaintiffs hired the defendant to perform renovations to their home.
The plaintiffs terminated the contract believing the defendant's workmanship was poor and that he caused some damage to their home and created a mess.
The plaintiffs sued the defendant alleging damages.
The defendant counterclaimed the cost of the work completed but for which he was not paid and compensation for the lost use of his tools.
HELD: The Court granted judgment for damages in the amount of $3,822 for necessary repairs and $100 for cleaning expenses and granted the counter-claim in the amount of $580 for unpaid work performed by the defendant and then applied setoff.
The Court allowed the cost of issuing the claim and for reasonable cost of service.","[2, 7, 3, 16, 12, 14, 10, 6, 15, 5, 4, 11]"
792,"Mr. Drysdale is First Nations and he was homeless at the time.
He and his companion had much to drink that day and Mr. Drysdale was intoxicated.
He had a verbal confrontation with Simon Brown, a security officer providing loss protection services to the 7-Eleven.
Mr. Drysdale returned to his dufflebag a short distance away from the confrontation, took out a kitchen butcher knife and walked towards Mr. Brown.
Frightened, Mr. Brown, and a second security officer also in his company, ran -- Mr. Brown to his SUV vehicle in the parking lot a short distance away.
Mr. Drysdale pursued him to the vehicle and slashed one of the vehicle’s tires with the knife he was still carrying.
Mr. Drysdale left the scene, went to the rear of the 7-Eleven building and, in an alleyway, went into a yard and threw away the knife.
Police attended, arrested and charged him with the offence that he faced at his trial.
THE INDICTMENT [2] The indictment sworn against Mr. Drysdale dated October 1, 2015 charges as follows: 1.
THE FACTS [3] This case rests primarily upon its facts.
The defence called Mr. Drysdale to give his evidence.
The evidence of these witnesses, which I will now review, provided the facts and circumstances of this case.","The plaintiff purchased insurance from the defendant.
In 2000, the plaintiff's farm was damaged by a fire.
He commenced an action against Wawanesa Insurance Company in 2001.
In 2006, the plaintiff commenced an action against the defendant, alleging that the defendant was in breach of contract or negligent for failing to obtain full replacement value insurance coverage for the plaintiff.
The defendant filed his defence in April 2007.
Mediation took place in September 2010 and examinations for discovery were held in May 2011.
At that time, the defendant asked the plaintiff to disclose the amount recovered in the Wawanesa lawsuit and the plaintiff refused.
The defendant brought this application for relief that: 1) The plaintiff's action be dismissed for want of prosecution; or 2) The plaintiff be required to disclose the amount recovered in the other lawsuit.
The defendant argued that the delays between the issuance of the statement of claim to the examination for discovery and then the delay between the time of mediation to May 2012 when the plaintiff's counsel filed the reply to undertakings were both inordinate.HELD: The Court applied the test established in International Capitol Corp. v. Robinson Twigg &amp; Ketilson to determine whether or not a matter should be struck for want of prosecution.
The Court found that the first delay was inordinate but because the plaintiff and defendant both acknowledged that the action against the defendant would only proceed depending on the outcome of the claim against Wawanesa, the delay was excusable.
The Court found that the second delay was excessive, but was not sufficient to strike the claim on that basis.
Applying the factors provided in Capitol, the Court found:1. Stage of litigation: It did not occur at an early stage of the litigation as the matter could well go to pre-trial conference.
2. Impact of delay: The delay was not causing any problems for the defendant.
3. The context in which the delay occurred: the delay in question was actually only one year during which the plaintiff's counsel did not respond in a timely fashion to undertakings.
4. Reasons offered for delay: Counsel was busy and it had to determine which undertaking could or could not be answered.
5. The role of counsel in causing the delay: The Court held that the delay caused by the plaintiff's counsel should not be a reason to deprive the plaintiff of his claim for actions beyond his control.
The Court denied the application to strike the plaintiff's claim but ordered that the plaintiff disclose the amount obtained in the Wawanesa action on the basis that this case fell into the exception to the policy which protects settlement communications.
Here, the communications sought by the defendant were relevant and necessary to avoid double recovery.","[2, 4, 3, 7, 5, 6, 8, 9, 10, 12, 16, 17]"
793,"for the applicant Michael J. Morris for the respondent JUDGMENT SCHERMAN J.
The plan of arrangement involves a proposed liquidation and dissolution with a provision that if various shareholders of record cannot be found after outreach efforts, their pro rata entitlement to return of the corporation’s capital will accrue to and be paid to the remaining known shareholders.
FCC argues the court has the power to approve such an arrangement under the powers given to it under ss.
186.1(4), 203(8) and 210(m) of the Act.
[2] The Director of Saskatchewan Corporations Branch opposes approval of the plan of arrangement on the basis that s. 204 of the Act requires a corporation to distribute its assets among its shareholders according to their respective rights on dissolution and s. 220 directs that property distributable to a shareholder who cannot be found shall be converted to money and paid to the Minister of Finance.
Under s. 220(3) shareholders can apply to the Minister of Finance for payment out to them on proof of entitlement.
[5] The purpose of the arrangement was described in a Notice of Meeting and Management Information Circular circulated to known shareholders in advance of the meeting which approved the plan of arrangement.","The Crown applied under Part XXIV of the Criminal Code to have the accused declared a dangerous offender after he pled guilty to committing an aggravated assault on his common-law spouse contrary to s. 268 of the Code.
The application is based on the Code provisions in effect before the danger offender legislation set forth in The Tackling Violent Crime Act was passed.
The accused is 52 years old and in poor health.
He has a significant criminal record thatreveals a history of violence and an inability to abide by court orders.
The offences occurred between the time he was 40 and ended in 2006 with his last conviction, the predicate offence.
Two psychologists prepared psychological assessments both of which concluded that the offender should not be declared a dangerous offender because his risk to re-offend could be reasonably managed by supervision in the community.
The issues before the Court were: 1) whether the predicate offence is a serious personal injury offence as defined by s. 752 of the Code; 2) whether the offender is a threat of the kind contemplated by s. 753 of the Code and thus a danger to society; 3) if so, whether the Court should exercise its residual discretion an impose a fixed-term sentence or resort to long-term offender provisions, even though the statutory criteria for declaring the accused a dangerous offender have been met; and if a long-term offender designation is warranted, what determinate sentence and long-term supervision order should be imposed?
HELD: 1) The Court held that the aggravated assault committed by the offender was a serious personal injury offence because it was an indictable offence involving the use of violence against his spouse.
2) The Court found that the Crown had proven the criteria required that the offender clearly fits within the definition set forth in ss. 753(1)(a)(i) and (ii), in that this offender had shown a repetitive and persistent pattern of aggressive behavior, especially against women.
3) The Court decided to exercise its residual discretion not to designate the offender as a dangerous offender and found that the he met the long-term offender criteria and that his risk to re-offend could be managed within the meaning of s. 753.1(1)(c).
The offender has never been imprisoned in a penitentiary and thus had never had the benefit of programming offered in that system.
The appropriate sentence should be 7 years.
As the offender has spent approximately 3 years and 4 months in pre-sentence custody, the Court gave him credit in that amount on a one-to-one basis.
The Court ordered that the appropriate length of time for a long term supervision order is the maximum of 10 years since the offender needs to learn alternative ways to express his frustration and address his issues with alcohol.","[4, 1, 7, 5, 6, 3, 15]"
794,"MAY 5, 2016INTRODUCTION [1] A mystery has occurred on this file.
The transcript from the small claims trial was not filed within the six month period set forth in ss.
39(5) of The Small Claims Act, 1997, SS 1997, c S-50.11 [Act].
Why the transcript was not filed is unknown.
What is known is the failure did not occur through the fault of the appellant.
[2] Because of this non-filing, the respondent argues the appeal must be dismissed based on ss.
39(5) of the Act.
The appellant, however, says it did nothing wrong here and it would be an affront to the administration of justice to simply determine the appeal to be dismissed.
BACKGROUND [3] A small claims trial was conducted before Judge Kovatch.
A decision was rendered on April 30, 2015 and certified a judgment on May 28, 2015.
Accompanying that notice of appeal was a copy of the request for transcript which the solicitor for the appellant had forwarded to the Provincial Court of Saskatchewan.
Presumably the reference to tapes means the recording of the trial proceedings in whatever form they exist.
That letter is not copied to either the appellant or the respondent.
There is no indication the appellant or the respondent received a copy of this correspondence.","HELD: The applicant’s first two grounds of appeal related to the evidence of the respondents’ and police.
The Court of Appeal was not persuaded that questions of evidence were of sufficient importance to grant leave.
The applicant’s third ground was that the Chambers judge failed to take into account the interests of the public, particularly, the need to deter the public and the need to remove profit from crime to compensate victims.
The Court of Appeal did not grant leave on the third ground.
The Chambers judge reviewed the relevant case law and did not fail to take those items into account.
The last ground of appeal was the fact that the vehicle had already been held for 90 days.
The Court of Appeal said that this ground did raise some interest but they were not convinced that this was the case to grant the leave to appeal.","[2, 6, 1, 3, 5, 4, 7, 8, 9, 10, 18, 19, 15, 12]"

DETAILED HISTORY OF THE PROCEEDINGS[7] The chronology of events and court appearances in this case, as set out in the court record and the evidence heard on this application, is crucial to the disposition of the matter.
Mr. Ali seeks private counsel.
The matter is adjourned to June 11, 2012 for Show Cause Hearing.","The accused was charged with impaired driving and driving with a blood alcohol level over .08.
The accused was permitted to use his cell phone on the way to the RCMP detachment to call his wife in Calgary and request help in finding a lawyer.
He did not receive a call back from his wife.
The RCMP officer advised the accused that he could provide a phone book and access to a phone and that Legal Aid was available.
The accused stated that he would talk to Legal Aid.
After the call was completed, the accused asked the officer if they had got the dumbest lawyer they could find.
The officer asked the accused if he was satisfied with his call and he said 'sure.'
The accused testified that his response was sarcastic, but the officer took it at face value.
The accused said nothing further about the lawyer call.
The accused's movements in the detachment were recorded on VHS videotape.
The video is a series of still shots taken every four seconds and there is no audio.
The video was taped over every 60 days and had been destroyed before it was requested by defence counsel.
HELD: There was no breach of the accused's rights under s. 10(b) of the Charter.
Even though the accused's cell phone was taken from him before he received a call back from his wife, it is clear that the accused made a conscious decision to call Legal Aid, and by implication, did not wish to pursue the first course of action.
There was no obligation on the part of the RCMP to provide the accused with a Prosper warning.
The accused did not clearly indicate that the legal advice he received was inadequate or suggest that he wanted to consult with another lawyer.
The officer was justified in assuming that the accused was satisfied with the legal advice he had received.
The Crown stayed the impaired driving count prior to the conclusion of the trial.
The videotape evidence was not relevant to the .08 offence because all observations were made at roadside.
The video would not have shown anything of relevance to the charge.
There is no breach of the accused's rights under s. 7.
The Certificate of Analysis was admitted into evidence and the accused was convicted of the .08 charge.","[4, 5, 6, 9, 10, 16, 1, 7, 8, 11, 21, 18, 26, 25, 22]"

[2] The circumstances of the offence to which Ms. Fellner has entered a guilty plea are straight- forward and undisputed.
Shortly after 1:00 p.m. on April 25, 2014, the police received a complaint about a vehicle that was travelling in excess of the speed limit and overtaking vehicles when it was unsafe to do so.
At one point, it ran off the road into the ditch and then continued north bound on the highway.
A police officer was able to stop the vehicle and speak to the accused who was the driver.
He noted that she appeared nervous, used words in an odd order and handed him a memorial card for her grandfather when asked for her vehicle registration.
The officer expressed shock at those readings as the accused’s speech was clear and her walking gait appeared normal.
The accused admitted to the officer that she has been an alcoholic for many years and lived daily under the influence of alcohol.
[3] Ms. Fellner testified that she has consumed alcohol since she was 15 or 16 years old.","A Child and Family Services agency applied for an order: 1) declaring that the foster parents of three children have sufficient interest pursuant to s. 23 of The Child and Family Services Act; and 2) granting the foster parents custody pursuant to s. 37(1)(b).
The children's mother was deceased and their father indicated that he was unable to meet his children's needs.
The foster parents intended to continue to allow the father parenting time with the children.
They also indicated that they would care for the children until each is 18 or until the order was terminated.
The father consented to a draft order agreeing the children should be in the custody of the Minister and that he have reasonable access.
The agency amended their application for the custody order to be made in favour of the foster parents rather than the Minister.
HELD: The children were in need of protection pursuant to s. 11(b).
The Court found that the agency's amended application was appropriate and preferred to a temporary order in favour of the Minister.
Also, the Court noted that s. 39 allows for amendments of orders if circumstances change.
The Court, therefore, ordered that the foster parents have custody even though the father only indicated his consent to the order in favour of the Minister.
The agency was required to ensure that a copy of the written decision was personally served on the father.","[3, 4, 6, 13, 5, 12, 7, 11, 0]"
797,"[2] The parties were involved in a spousal relationship for almost 10 years.
They had no children together although the husband has children from a prior relationship for whom he pays support.
During the relationship the wife suffered from health problems which resulted in her becoming disabled and unable to continue her employment.
During this same time period the husband secured full-time employment with CN.
[3] The parties separated in July 2015.
The wife currently supports herself from two sources of disability benefits for a total income in the range of $20,000 per year.
She has lived frugally and has kept her expenses at a minimum.
Since separation she has resided with extended family members, most recently her mother, with the result that she has no costs for housing.
Although she deposes that this is not sustainable long-term, she has not provided any evidence respecting her future plans or whether she has applied for subsidized housing.

The judge held that the usual rules of evidence pertaining to criminal trials apply to a s. 810.2 hearing and that records kept by the Correctional Services of Canada (CSC) were inadmissible as business records under s. 30 of the Canada Evidence Act.
The respondent had been convicted in 2009 of robbery with violence, assault causing bodily harm, assault and three counts of violating bail.
He was sentenced to three years' imprisonment.
In May 2010, the CSC referred the respondent's case to the National Parole Board (NPB) with a recommendation that he be detained until warrant expiry, in accordance with s. 129(2) of the Corrections and Conditional Release Act (CCRA).
The recommendation was based upon the character of the respondent's offences and where there are reasonable grounds to believe that the offender is likely to commit another offence causing death or serious harm if released on parole.
The NPB ordered that the respondent be detained in custody until the expiry of the sentence.
Reviewed annually under the CCRA, the CSC prepared another assessment in 2011 and the respondent was not released from custody until March 2012.
At that point, a 'warrant expiry package' was prepared by a parole officer, comprised of CSC records relating to the respondent, including a criminal profile report, the assessment for decision reports and copies of the NPB's reasons for ordering detention.
These records were sent to the RCMP in Saskatchewan.
The officer concerned then swore the information under s. 810.2, stating that he believed that there were reasonable grounds to believe that the respondent would commit a serious personal offence as defined by s. 752 of the Code.
The application for a hearing was commenced in August 2012.
The parole officer and the RCMP officer were called to testify and the Crown applied to have the documents in the package admitted into evidence, and the respondent opposed the application.
The judge refused to allow the admission of the report, the assessment and the NPB reasons for ordering detention based upon R. v. Fontaine and R. v. Toulejour.
Based on the business rules exception, the judge held that the criminal report profile was inadmissible because it was a copy and not accompanied by supporting affidavits as required by s. 30(3) of the CEA.
HELD: The Court held that the application was allowed.
The Supreme Court had confirmed that s. 810 hearings are not criminal trials and that the rules of evidence in criminal trials do not apply.
Hearsay evidence is admissible and the judge is to determine whether or not sufficient weight can be given to the hearsay evidence to establish reasonable and probable grounds required for the individual to swear the information to justify the fear of harm to others by the respondent.
The Court held that all of the CSC records submitted as part of the package were admissible under the CEA.
The Court directed that the matter be returned for a new hearing of the original application.","[1, 2, 4, 5, 3, 6, 10, 7, 13, 8, 9, 16]"

The issue before the Court was to determine where the child should primarily reside and attend school.
Each party saw the other as a competent and loving parent.
The petitioner had another child, a half-brother to the parties' child, who was an infant at the time of the application.
The petitioner was a stay-at-home mom on social assistance and the respondent was a student who worked part-time and lived with his parents.
The respondent's parents were willing to assist the respondent financially and in the care of the child.
The Court ordered custody/access report concluded that the child should primarily reside with the respondent, though the author noted that the decision was almost too close to make.
HELD: The Court held that the best interests of the child would be best served by her primarily residing with the respondent and the parties having joint custody of the child.
The Court first considered the quality of the child's relationship with each party and their families and concluded there was little difference between the parties but the child had a closer relationship with the respondent's extended family because she resided with them when she was with the respondent.
The Court also determined that the child's economic needs could best be met residing with the respondent and his parents.
The home environment of the respondent was found to outweigh that of the petitioner's.
Further, the Court held that the child would have greater stability and continuity with the respondent, who has a concrete future plan.
The petitioner's future plans were wavering and uncertain.
The respondent was ordered to bear the responsibility for transporting the child to and from Moose Jaw and Regina.
The respondent was also required to accommodate the petitioner and child by supporting Internet communications between them during the week, especially at bedtime.
The petitioner was granted parenting time three consecutive weekends and the respondent on the fourth weekend.
The second of the petitioner's weekends was extended to include another day as were any weekends with school or statutory holidays.
The decision requires the child to miss one day of school every four weeks and the Court therefore left it to the parties to determine whether this can continue once the child begins grade two.
The parties were ordered to each parent the child for half of Easter and Christmas breaks and they were to accommodate each other for Mother's and Father's Day each year.
Further, the Court ordered that the child spend half of each summer holiday with each parent, suggesting that alternating weeks may be the best for the child, unless otherwise agreed to by the parties.
Lastly, if the child has a school break longer than three clear days, the petitioner is to parent at least one-half of those days.
The Court also urged the parties to collaborate and discuss the extra-curricular activities best suited for the child taking into account their affordability and disruption to the parenting arrangement.","[1, 0, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 10, 9, 11, 12, 13, 14]"

[3] For the reasons hereinafter set forth, Mr. Newell’s appeal is dismissed.
I.
In March of 2012, the Director, acting as the agent of Mr. Newell’s landlord, applied for an order terminating Mr. Newell’s tenancy pursuant to ss.
68 and 70 of The Residential Tenancies Act, 2006, S.S. 2006, c. R-22.0001, on the grounds that Mr. Newell was trafficking drugs.
[5] The Residential Tenancies Act hearing officer determined that Mr. Newell was more likely than not trafficking in marihuana but found the evidence insufficient to make a determination that Mr. Newell was trafficking from the house.
There was no appeal filed by the Director.
[6] The Director then filed a motion with the Court of Queen’s Bench on May 8, 2012, against the landlord for a community safety order pursuant to s. 8 of SCAN.
II.
Decision of the Court Below [8] The Chambers judge’s decision can be found at 2012 SKQB 441 (CanLII).
I agree that it is arguable the same issue is before the court as was heard by the Hearing Officer.","The plaintiff’s claim was dismissed.
The plaintiff had not proven his claim on a balance of probabilities that the defendant was responsible for the damage to his lawn.","[5, 3, 6, 20, 13, 9, 19, 8, 29, 14, 10]"
800,"The front of the three cheques were filed as an exhibit with the Court.
There is no issue that the defendants received $5,000.00 each.
[2] The defendant Christos Karampatsos (Christos) states that he received the $1,000.00 cheque, cheque number 16733, and simply was asked to sign it and return it, which he did.
He claims he did not receive any money for the cheque.
$1,000.00 Cheque[3] As for the $1,000.00 cheque, John Georgacacos (John), owner of the plaintiff corporation, and the only witness for the plaintiff stated that the cheque was for $1,000.00 and he had previously given Christos cash.
The return of the cheque was to pay it back.
John states that Christos wanted money to do something so he gave one thousand dollars cash and that they had to pay it back.
So when the thousand dollar cheque is paid to Christos he then pays it back, in returnd for the $1,000.00 loaned.
Christos says that he signed the cheque and gave it back to John.
[5] What John had testified to, that he had given $1,000.00 cash advance and that the return of the $1,000.00 dollar cheque was repayment of the advance, does not make sense.","The Court dismissed the application.

The accused and the complainant are well acquainted with one another - in fact their mothers are cousins.
The accused lives with his grandmother in a trailer and K.S., along with her father and her young cousin, live in her grandmother’s house.
At the time of the alleged offences, yet another sister (who I shall refer to as C.Y.S.)

HELD: The Court could not locate any cases that suggested there was a duty to act fairly and in good faith by an insurance company because of an insurance policy where no claim was made against it.
The Court found that it would be impossible for SMI to act fairly and in good faith to the plaintiffs and to concurrently act fairly and in good faith to the first defendants.
SMI only had a duty to defend the first defendants pursuant to their policy of insurance.
The Court noted the following in making its conclusion: 1) if SMI also had a duty to the plaintiffs, they could not use tactical or substantive errors of the plaintiffs to minimize their payment obligation.
The insurer would not be able to vigorously defend the claim; and 2) the first defendant may be required to pay more if there was a duty by SMI to the plaintiffs.
Many insurance policies have co-insurance provisions or require deductibles be paid by the insured.
The Court held that the claim against SMI, and its employees and agents, had no reasonable chance of success.
The Court also awarded costs against the plaintiffs for filing improper affidavit material.

The deceased witness’s evidence was not relied upon by the court due to inconsistencies.
The assistant manager’s evidence also had some inconsistencies but overall his oral testifying was found to be in a frank and honest manner.
The court accepted the assistant manager’s evidence that he would not have told the employee or anyone to go down into the pit to clear a blockage, because it is not possible to clear such a blockage from inside the pit.
The Crown argued that, in any event, the court should infer that because the employee entered the pit, the respondent did not adequately instruct, train, supervise and inform him.
The court found that the mass of training material emphasized the dangers and the importance of following the safety procedures.
The information was not buried in a mass of other information as suggested by the Crown.
The court found that the information, training, instruction and supervision was sufficient, if adhered to, to ensure the health and safety of the employee, generally.
The Crown argued that a culture of paying lip service to safety had developed at the respondent’s place of business.
The court held that, despite some lapses in safety, overall there was a culture of safety.
The court also held that the respondent did not instruct the employee to unplug a blockage in the pit and, therefore, did not have an obligation to instruct him on how to perform that task.
The respondent was not guilty of counts 1 and 2.
The Crown also did not prove the actus reus of counts 3 and 4.
The Crown failed to prove that the respondent did not adequately train and supervise the employee with respect to responding to a blockage by looking into the receiving pit to see if it was full of grain.
The court also concluded that the respondent had made the employee aware of the hazard of being engulfed in grain in a receiving pit and, therefore, the actus reus of counts 5 and 6 were not proved.
The court noted that if the actus reus had been proven with respect to any count, the court would have, nonetheless, concluded that the respondent exercised due diligence.","[4, 7, 1, 6, 5, 13, 14, 0, 11, 17, 12]"

It did not refer to the expert opinion submitted by the appellant as new evidence at the hearing; and 2) by failing to explain its decision.
It did not refer to the new evidence nor did it state how it had reconciled the conflicting expert opinion evidence offered by the appellant and the respondent.

Preliminary Request[2] Prior to this application being heard, Richer requested that the Court allow him to represent Sinobert “as he has no ability to represent himself, having suffered three strokes since 1993 and suffers the effects from mercury poisoning (Minamata disease) and its effects, for which he has suffered with for his 62 years of life”.
[3] It was obvious from the evidence the Court received concerning Sinobert’s physical and mental health and the Court’s observations of Sinobert during the application that he was suffering from some kind of disability.
Rule 2-34 of The Queen’s Bench Rules requires that a party with a disability be represented by a lawyer.
However, in the unique circumstances of this case, with Sinobert consenting and the respondent not really taking issue with Richer’s request, the Court allowed Richer to make submissions to the Court on Sinobert’s behalf as well as his own.
That proved to be beneficial for everyone as towards the end of the argument Sinobert had to be assisted by a court official for a blood sugar related situation that had culminated during the application.
Background Facts[4] Most of the facts in this matter are not in dispute.","HELD: The appeal as to the convictions and the sentences imposed was dismissed.
The court found with respect to each issue that the trial judge had not erred: 1) the defence had acknowledged the appellant had used force and that his spouse had not consented to it.
Therefore the appellant could not argue on appeal that the trial judge failed to take implied consent into account.
The trial judge was entitled to accept the spouse’s testimony as she was not cross-examined at trial.
There was nothing in the transcript that showed the trial judge took a zero tolerance approach.
The trial judge found that defence of de minimis was not open to the appellant based on her finding that the application of force by the appellant was more than trifling.
On appeal, the court could not substitute its view of the evidence from that of the trial judge; 2) the trial judge found that the appellant intentionally drove in a manner that he knew created a danger for others and to frighten his spouse.
She was entitled to conclude the appellant’s conduct was a marked departure from that expected of reasonably prudent driver.
The evidence was reasonably capable of supporting her decision; and 3) the appellant had not identified how the trial judge had erred on any of the grounds an appeal court could consider.
It was not open to it to intervene only because it would have weighed sentencing factors differently from the trial judge.","[0, 1, 5, 3, 6, 8, 7, 10, 4]"

November 14, 2013 Ex officio INTRODUCTION[1] This is an application for judicial review of a decision of The Workers’ Compensation Board (the “Board”) denying the applicant reimbursement for the cost of the applicant’s medical marihuana.
BACKGROUND[2] The applicant suffers from chronic back pain and muscle spasms as a result of work related injuries incurred in 1981 and 1982.
The respondent concedes the applicant is entitled to compensation under The Workers’ Compensation Act, 1979, S.S. 1979, c. W-17.1 (the “Act”).

[4] In 2011, the Board denied the applicant reimbursement for the cost of his medical marihuana.
Upon an application for judicial review of that decision, Justice McMurtry found that the Board improperly fettered its discretion by relying on the submissions of the Board’s medical consultant and medical department.
Justice McMurtry remitted the matter to the Board.
The applicant brings this application to review the Board’s decision to once again deny reimbursement to the applicant.
Did the Board exceed its jurisdiction in enacting Policy Statement 5 of POL 10/2011 to deny reimbursement of medical marihuana claims in all cases?","HELD: The application was granted.

The tenant denies responsibility, contending the cause is normal wear and tear or high humidity arising from water entering the building due to inherent structural defects for which the landlord is responsible.
The tenant asserts that the landlord breached the lease by failing to repair the roof and by failing to take other remedial measures to prevent water from infiltrating the building, resulting in losses to the tenant’s restaurant operating in the building.
The tenant also claims damages for economic interference, alleging the landlord interfered with the sale of its restaurant.

FACTSIn 1988, the applicant, a member who was then in good standing with the Law Society of Saskatchewan, was charged with several counts of theft and fraud pursuant to the Criminal Code.
The Law Society Investigation Committee report recommended that a hearing be held to inquire into substantially the same circumstances as those contained in the criminal charges.
On December 15, 1988 the Law Society of Saskatchewan appointed a Hearing Committee to hear a formal complaint against the applicant.
At the first meeting of the Hearing Committee on May 1, 1989, the applicant challenged the jurisdiction of the Hearing Committee to proceed on the basis that he had not been treated fairly by the investigation process and therefore, the Hearing Committee had no jurisdiction.
This application was dismissed on May 31, 1989.","In a contract of employment, which involved an agreement changing the plaintiff from 'expatriate' to 'local' status, a termination clause providing that the agreement could be terminated upon 3 months' notice was held to be inadequate language to abrogate the implied term of reasonable notice.
The plaintiff had correctly interpreted the clause as relating to the termination of the agreement, not of his employment.
The agreement provided that it was governed by the laws of the province of Alberta.
The plaintiff had been employed by the defendant for 12 years and was awarded compensation in an amount equivalent to 18 months notice less the three months pay he already received and any income from his new employment over the balance of the 15 months.
He was also awarded the loss resulting from the difference in vacation and loss of an auto allowance for the 15 months.

Two issues are raised for review.
The first is whether there is a reasonable apprehension of bias raised by the involvement of the Director of Professional Review in the hearing conducted by the Committee.
The second is whether there is a reasonable apprehension of institutional bias raised by the roles of the Director and the Committee assigned to them by the Act.
The notice of appeal was subsequently amended to include these judicial review issues.

The Committee in its decision acknowledged that Dr. Huerto is a competent cardiologist and that the standards of patient care aspect of his practice is not an issue in these proceedings.
Accordingly the economics of providing quality patient care is the primary issue to be determined by a professional review.","The appellant, which was a wholly owned subsidiary of a major international company, induced the respondent to enter a franchise agreement by making representations as to the viability of the venture.

and (3) the appellant's claim for the value of the inventory together with pre-judgment interest was payable by the respondent.
In a dissenting opinion, it was held that neither the appellant's conduct nor the franchise agreement was unconscionable; rather the respondent was an experienced businessman and the representations as to the venture's viability were mere projections, which he should have realized were unreliable.","[1, 9, 0, 6, 13, 2, 10, 12, 11, 8, 14, 15, 26]"

The evidence indicated that the respondent had received independent legal advice and she did not establish that she had been dominated by the petitioner to the extent that her signature would have been induced by undue influence or duress.
The court determined that the respondent would be far worse off if the agreement was set aside and an equal division ordered.","[0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 10, 12]"

In the two days immediately preceding the trial, Crown counsel disclosed the existence of approximately 1,900 documents.
Mr. Chu submits that the trial judge should have granted an adjournment to permit a proper assessment of the late-disclosed documents.
As part of this argument, Mr. Chu submits that neither Crown counsel nor the trial judge could have accurately assessed the relevance of the documents as the judge was not provided with sufficient information to permit such an assessment.

I agree with Mr. Chu’s submissions.
To this day, the documents remain undisclosed.
This Court is in the same position as the trial judge, which means that we are not in a position to assess the undisclosed documents to determine whether the undisclosed information could have affected the verdict.

FACTS [3] On July 14, 1999, Lisa Baert went to the Lloydminster Hospital for a tubal ligation.
[4] On July 16, Ms. Baert was rushed back to the hospital in an ambulance, suffering from septic shock.
Dr. Graham and a general surgeon operated on her and discovered a 2-millimetre puncture in her small bowel.
The puncture had apparently occurred when Dr. Graham had done the tubal ligation two days earlier.
While in surgery she went into cardiac arrest.
She suffered some brain damage.
The article was about Ms. Baert’s surgery.
The article came to Dr. Graham’s attention.
He felt that it was inaccurate, inflammatory and very one-sided.
It described Ms. Baert’s bowel as having been “sliced open” when there was only a small 2-millimetre puncture in it.
The article said that he ignored Mr. Baert when he came out of the operating room but he did not.
The second article was entitled “Couple Fed Up with Long Wait for Compensation”.
Dr. Graham was shocked by these articles and felt they were misleading.

820,"DECISION AFTER HEARING R. GREEN, J I.
INTRODUCTION[1] WBA was born on October 6, 2015.
His mother is CB, now 19 years of age, and his father is JA, now 16 years of age.
[2] This infant was technically apprehended at birth by the Minister of Social Services, but the Minister did not proceed with the application, and CB was allowed to take the baby home with her.
[3] The concerns expressed in the maternity alert from Rosetown were:1.
CB had diminished cognitive abilities, as she suffers from FASD, and as a result she has challenges around understanding and retaining information, despite presenting as though this is not the case;2.
CB has a history of being involved in a physically abusive domestic relationship;3.
CB has other mental health concerns, including anxiety, depression and cluster B personality traits; and4.
CB has addiction issues.
[4] While the dates are not clear in the evidence, the young parents and their baby then lived in a house in Canora for a few weeks, with either grandmother TK or grandfather BA present with them.
They then moved to grandfather BA’s farm, and essentially lived there with BA supervising them until November 23, 2015.
When she arrived, JA was very angry and was yelling.","This was an appeal from a Supreme Court decision on an interpleader application by the respondent Shubenacadie Band to determine which of several parties was entitled to be paid a sum of money owed by the Band to the respondent Francis, an Indian residing on the Eskasoni Reserve in Cape Breton, for the construction of residential homes on the Shubenacadie Reserve.
Francis had made a number of assignments of book debts, some general and some specific, to the various claimants.
The trial judge concluded that he was bound by s.89(1) of the Indian Act, which holds that the real and personal property of an Indian or a band situated on a reserve is not subject to charge, pledge, mortgage, attachment, levy, seizure, distress or execution in favour of or at the instance of any person other than an Indian or a band.
He concluded that the money owed Francis by the Shubenacadie band was the property of an Indian on a reserve, and that assignment of book debts, both general and specific, were included within the meaning of s.89(1).
He found that the respondent Eskasoni Band was the only Indian entity among the several claimants and ordered the money paid to them.
The appellants appealed.
Allowing the appeal on the issue of the Indian Act,
that s.89(1) does not prevent an Indian from assigning book debts of his construction business to secure business loans.
When Indians are in business they hold and deal with their business property in the commercial mainstream on terms no different than those applicable to all Canadians.
Nevertheless, the Eskasoni Band is still entitled to the money owed to Francis by reason of having obtained the first general assignment of book debts from him and having registered it prior to Francis making further assignments.
The registration of a general assignment of book debts is constructive notice of the assignment to subsequent assignees falling within the provisions of s.3 of the Assignment of Book Debts Act.","[2, 1, 6, 4, 8, 7, 9, 3, 10, 11, 14, 12]"

Ronald is of the opinion that these improvements have added to the value of the Property.","When Davidson, Sr. sold his farm to his son he retained the right to continue receiving the rentals arising from four surface leases which he had previously granted to oil companies in respect to producing oil wells.
The son granted an option to purchase to the plaintiff which was exercised and a fee simple title was issued in 1973 subject to encumbrances including caveats protecting the surface leases.
There was no reference to the rent charge reserved or excluded by the option agreement.
The plaintiff asserted that whatever rights arose from the option agreement were merged in the transfer and effectively disappeared upon the registration of the transfer and the issuance of a new unencumbered title.
HELD: Declaration denied.
Plaintiff's action dismissed with costs.
1)The absence of a caveat protecting the rent charge has had no affect because of the plaintiff's continued ownership of the property.
 2)Rarely, if ever, has there been a case where, as here, a purchaser has contracted to obtain the property under an instrument clearly accepting the unregistered equitable interest, then has obtained a fee simple title, then has permitted the unregistered interest to continue unimpeded for 15 years and then, perhaps tiring of the inconvenience of the lease and thinking that the money would be useful, has decided to seek an order of this Court terminating the other interest and directing that it be paid to him.
His counsel made no suggestion that the plaintiff had a moral claim, it was purely an attempt to secure by legal means that which he had previously agreed to forego.
This is a court of equity as well as a court of law and as such it is repugnant that the court be called upon to vest in an applicant an interest which he has heretofore freely recognized to be the property of another, both before and after receiving his transfer under The Land Titles Act.
3)It was apparent that there was no intention that the rent charge would be merged since it was recognized and allowed to continue for 15 years.","[3, 4, 11, 10, 8, 1, 2, 6, 13, 19, 21, 14, 9]"

Accordingly, it was not possible, at that time, to enter into a s. 24(2) consideration.
As a result, the trial resumed on February 6, 2017 with the Crown presenting all of its evidence.

If the matter had been raised at trial and the judge then thought that the evidence not disclosed impacted the accused's defence, he could have adjourned the trial.
2)The evidence not disclosed would not have affected the accused's defence in any event.

Formal issuance of an order slipped through the cracks and thus no judgment was ever taken out.
[2] The application now brought by R.M.
[R.] is to have formal judgment issued and to vary that decision in favour of her having primary residence.
In the absence of an order varying the shared parenting order, she seeks a Voices of the Children, (here a Voice of the Child as V. is the only person in issue), report be undertaken in order to ascertain V.’s wishes and thereby gain clarity on his best interests.

[X.]
[6] X. disagrees with R. in all respects, thus the affidavits are conflicting in nature, to put it mildly.

HELD: The application to exclude evidence is denied.
1)The officers were lawfully present in the premises when Sergeant Bell inadvertently found the knapsack and its contents which were in plain view.
He reasonably believed that the knapsack and the contents were evidence of a crime.
Therefore it was neither unreasonable nor unlawful for him to seize these items.
The search was authorized by law and the manner in which it was carried out was reasonable.
2)Even if the accused's rights under s.8 of the Charter had been violated this would not be a proper case to exclude the evidence under s.24(2) of the Charter.
The fairness of the trial will not be affected by the admission of the evidence.
The manner in which the search was conducted was neither abusive nor excessive.
The evidence was in plain view and was found inadvertently.
The admission of this evidence will not have an adverse effect upon the reputation of the administration of justice.","[3, 2, 4, 6, 7, 9, 10, 1, 5, 11]"

The commissioned salesman who was examined as the proper officer of the plaintiff gave evidence at the examination for discovery that he did not communicate the prices listed on his pricing sheet to the defendants but was adamant at trial that he had.
HELD: The claim for rectification was dismissed.
1)The testimony of the president and general manager was not accepted.
He signed the company's standard agreement which indicated that the price of the basement was included in the agreement.
The salesman's evidence that he provided an approximate price contradicted his own notations and the notation was consistent with the evidence of the defendants.
 2)A party seeking rectification must establish that the parties were of one mind as to the terms of the contract and the written record does not properly record that common intention.
3)The evidence was not clear as to when an interest rate of 15% was inserted into the document and the court was not satisfied that there was an agreement to pay interest.

The Shareholders' Agreement obliged all shareholders to vote their shares so as to confirm the nominees of certain shareholders, thereby freezing the board composition without regard for its performance.
As a result the board was dominated by the original Precision group of shareholders and even though the Government of Saskatchewan and Bondco were entitled to enough votes to exercise control of the company, they could not change the board and did not have the usual ways of enforcing their wishes.
Members of Bondco were concerned that jobs were being obtained in Saskatoon at the expense of Rosetown jobs and the economic spin-offs expected from their $800,000 investment were not being realized in Rosetown due to the opening of the Saskatoon facility.
An application was brought under s234 of the Business Corporations Act.
They sought a restraining order enforcing the covenant, an order appointing new directors, an order of compensation for breach of contract and an order directing the closure of the Saskatoon operation and the return of company assets to Rosetown district unless Bondco granted written consent.
HELD: It was ordered that 1)the Shareholders Agreement was amended deleting the offending paragraph concerning the Board of Directors and substituting a new paragraph; 2)certain provisions of the Articles of Continuance as amended were suspended until the Termination Date; 3)the present board was suspended pending the election of directors at a special meeting of shareholders; 4)the respondent was enjoined from moving its operations and from transferring or hiring employees at any place other than Rosetown District unless Bonco's written consent was filed with the Court.
5)The Chief Executive Officer was not displaced nor was the Saskatoon operation directed to be closed.
 6)Bonco was entitled to its taxable costs against the individual respondents.","[3, 2, 9, 17, 4, 15, 10, 14, 13, 18, 19, 11]"

Three innocent teenagers in a small Cobalt vehicle lawfully stopped at the side of the highway under construction were senselessly killed when their vehicle was struck in the rear by a semi‑truck driven by Normand Lavoie.
A young flag person standing near their vehicle was severely injured.
[2] The function of the Court at this time is to sentence Normand Lavoie.
That sentence must be just and fair and be consistent with previous judicial decisions in this jurisdiction, if at all possible.
There is really nothing that the Court can do to remedy what has happened.

now a self-represented respondent JUDGMENT CHOW J. December 19, 2017 INTRODUCTION [1] The petitioner and the respondent were married in Pakistan on December 2, 2001.
(also known as D****), born ---------------.
Instead of joining him, the respondent returned with D.K.
[3] After a series of temporary separations, the petitioner and respondent parted for the final time in April 2014.
The same day, he obtained a without notice order granting him interim parenting time, and prohibiting the respondent from removing D.K.
from the jurisdiction.
[6] The respondent subsequently applied for interim child and spousal support.
; 2) child support; 3) spousal support; 4) division of family property; and 5) divorce.
EVIDENCE The Petitioner’s Evidence [11] The petitioner was born May 7, 1974 in Pakistan.
At the time, the respondent was working as an intern.
[17] He described the respondent’s relationship with members of his own family as poor, and explained that, while they respect her, she has had little to do with them.
Despite never having met her father, the petitioner claimed to have a good relationship with the respondent’s family.
According to his evidence, whenever he was not at work, the petitioner helped the respondent care for D.K.
[32] He testified that from April until June 2012, the respondent took D.K.","An application to vary the terms of a 1995 consent judgment such that the applicant would have sole custody.
Alternatively he sought an order preventing the mother from removing their daughter from Saskatchewan.
The father obtained an ex parte order preventing the mother from removing the child from the province until the return date of the motion.
The mother had always been the primary caregiver and had custody since the separation in 1994.
The father had exercised regular and frequent access.
She was given exclusive possession of the matrimonial home under the terms of the consent judgment which contemplated the home would be listed for sale and the net proceeds divided between the parties.
Subsequent to the consent judgment the applicant went through bankruptcy proceedings in which he transferred his interest in the home to the trustee who then sold that interest to the respondent such that the applicant no longer had any interest in the home.
HELD: 1)Relocation was neither foreseen nor reasonably contemplated by the judge making the original order.
The threshold criteria was thus satisfied.
2)The trial of an issue was required as the matter could not be decided on the basis of affidavit evidence.
The child had a close relationship with both parents.
The disruption as a result of a change in custody or removal of the child from the community could not be assessed.
3)The applicant's request for interim relief was denied.
If the mother proceeded with her move a revision of the access provision would be appropriate. 4)The child's best interest is the proper test to be applied (Cote) having regard to the factors identified by the Supreme Court of Canada in Gordon.
5)The applicant became aware in early June of the mother's intention to move to British Columbia and did not object.
The timing of the application, a few weeks prior to the proposed move, raised the suspicion that it was the respondent's decision to sell the matrimonial home which prompted this application.
 6)Costs were left to the trial judge.","[16, 1, 9, 11, 58, 23, 14, 42, 13, 3, 5, 24, 29, 86, 41]"
829,"for Kent Jones and Rodney Argue Evan Jones on his own behalf FIAT SCHERMAN J. December 21, 2017Introduction[1] The applicants Kent Jones [Kent] and Rodney Argue [Rodney] ask the Court to remove the respondent Evan Jones [Evan] as an executor of the estate of Edna May Jones.
Their grounds are that Evan has brought an application that effectively challenges the validity of the Will he is presently an executor of and he is refusing to co-operate in taking the steps necessary to administer the estate and carry out the directions contained in the Last Will and Testament [Will] of Edna May Jones as admitted to probate.
The Factual Background [2] On July 13, 2016, Evan, Kent and Rodney filed with the Court an application for a grant of probate to them in respect of an October 15, 2015 Will of Edna May Jones [Edna], who died on November 19, 2015.
The three were designated in the Will as executors.
Each swore an affidavit stating they believed the Will to be the Last Will and Testament of Edna and that they would faithfully administer the property and legacies contained in the Will.
[3] The Will directed, inter alia, that: i. Ms. Edna Jones’ interest in the NW 20-26-16 W3 be transferred to Kent; ii.","The contract for the construction of a spur rail line to the grain terminal provided that either party could refer any contract dispute to arbitration.
The Arbitrator's award favoured the A &amp; E Rail Contractor's position.
Leave to appeal had been granted.
At issue was were whether the arbitrator applied the correct measure of damages and whether there was any evidence to support the findings of fact.
HELD: The appeal was dismissed and the award was confirmed.
The respondent's application for enforcement of the award was granted without costs.
1)The issues were questions of fact not law.
The errors complained of were the same questions referred to the arbitrator for determination.
Adding the phrase 'difference in costs to the builder' did not convert the issue from one of fact to one of law.
The wording on the second issue was changed slightly to read 'in his calculation as to damages awarded for increased costs of winter construction'.
There was some evidence upon which the arbitrator could make a finding of fact.
2)As none of the bars set out in the Act applied the court was required by s50(3) to give judgment enforcing the award.
 3)The application for costs on a solicitor and client basis was denied.
Failing agreement between the parties, the appellant would pay the respondent's taxed costs on the appeal on a party and party basis.","[2, 1, 7, 5, 3, 6]"
830,"THE INTERIM CONSENT ORDER [2] The provisions of the Order addressed Mr. Reid’s child and spousal support obligations.
It was based upon the petitioner’s then income of $48,196 and the respondent’s income of $0.
… [Emphasis added][3] The parties agreed by this provision of the Order that: … Given the amount of spousal support, the parties agree that these are reasonable arrangements for the support of the child pursuant to s. 15.1(8) of the Divorce Act.
[4] Paragraph 3(a) of the Order provided that Mr. Reid would pay to Ms. Ellis-Reid as spousal support the sum of “$1,250 per month commencing August 1, 2007 and continuing on the first of each and every month thereafter until further Order or agreement.” [Emphasis added] [5] Subparagraph 3(d) of the Order provided that spousal support is reviewable “if the CPP claim is successful and may be recalculated retroactively.” Subparagraph 3(c) obliged Ms. Ellis-Reid to advise Mr. Reid once her CPP claim was ruled upon.
This requirement reflected the understanding between the parties that because Ms. Ellis-Reid claimed she was disabled and therefore unable to work, she would make an application for CPP disability benefits/payments.
He was, when the Order was made and now continues to be, a member of the Canadian Armed Forces.
At para.
[8] Insofar as spousal support is concerned, Mr. Reid seeks an order from the court terminating his obligations for payment.","The petitioner sought an order under the Dependent's Relief Act that the younger child share equally with his brother in the estate of their deceased father.
Neither the deceased's Will nor the codicil made in November and December 1989 respectively made provision for the second son born December 1989, subsequent to the separation of the parties.
The elder son was the sole beneficiary and the farmlands were to be held in trust for him until he turned twenty-one.
The younger son was diabetic and had extraordinary medical expenses.
The eldest required braces.
The mother's income was $1,089 per month.
The deceased had been paying support in the amount of $150 per month per child pursuant to the 1991 divorce order.
The mother sought an order under s17(4) of the Divorce Act varying child maintenance from $300 to $1,245 per month for the two children.
The Executors did not oppose the application but put in issue the Estate's ability to support that level of maintenance.
HELD: The younger child was entitled to share equally with his brother in the estate as a reasonable provision had not been made for his maintenance.
Maintenance was varied to $900 per month for the two children.
 1)Different considerations arise in the context of a Dependants' Relief Act application taken in conjunction with a variation application.
The phrase 'reasonable provision' in s9(1) of the Dependants' Relief Act is to be no longer defined as that which would permit the dependent to maintain the standard of living enjoyed during the lifetime of the testator but is to be determined having regard to the testator's legal and moral obligations to the dependent and others (Ostrander).
A more generous award may result. 2)The preservation of an inheritance until the children attain the age of twenty-one is not a predominant factor.
The amount of maintenance is not, of necessity, tied to the standard of living experienced when the testator was alive or to the net income the Estate will generate subsequently.
The court departed from the Guidelines for the reason the award was made in conjunction with a Dependent's Relief application, the income of the estate was currently unknown, but the court was satisfied that reasonable provision has been made for the children.
3)There was nothing in the Will, read as a whole with reference to the ordinary rules of construction which required the term personal effects to be given anything other than their ordinary meaning; with the clarification that the testator did not wish to preserve personal use vehicles.
Thus, personal effects did not include grain, livestock, farm machinery, equipment or other assets related to the operations of the farm.
 4)Counsel for both parties were entitled to their costs of the proceedings to be paid on a solicitor-client basis out of the estate.","[1, 2, 6, 4, 9, 8, 13, 5]"

Kitsul For the DefendantJUDGMENT DEMONG, J Introduction [1] Reliable Truck & Trailer Inc., hereafter referred to as ‘Reliable’, is a mobile vehicle and associated equipment repair company situated in Pense, Saskatchewan.
When required, it would also provide shop supplies and parts to effect those services.
[2] Between the summer of 2015 and June of 2016, it provided shop supplies, parts, and services on a number of occasions.
Early in the relationship, Super Save paid Reliable’s invoices as they were presented, but in or about November of 2015 it ceased to pay invoices as they became due.
Some of these invoices were negotiated, reduced, and paid, and others were simply left unpaid without explanation.
[3] Eventually Reliable demanded payment of its outstanding invoices and Super Save offered a much smaller sum of money in satisfaction of those accounts.
Reliable was not prepared to accept the lesser amount and it now brings this action to recover the amount that it says is due.
It seeks prejudgment interest on that amount and its legal costs for having to bring this action.
It argues that in the absence of an express term in the agreement as to the amount that could be charged for each of the goods and services that were provided, Reliable is not free to charge whatever it chooses to charge.","This was an appeal from an assessment of $5,454,000 in damages resulting from the appellant's liability to the respondent in tort for negligently prepared financial statements upon which the respondent relied in deciding to purchase the shares of a business.
The appellants appealed.

Allowing the appeal reducing the damage award to $2,745,600,
that the trial judge erred in the test he applied to the award of damages.
The proper test is to put the respondent as far as possible in the position he would have been in if he had not invested in the company.
The damages are the amount by which the actual value of the company was less than what the respondent paid at the time of purchase.","[8, 6, 7, 12, 2, 4, 3, 14, 0]"

for Trial CounselHerauf J.A.
Introduction [1] The appellant was convicted after trial of sexually assaulting his 11-year-old niece contrary to s. 271 of the Criminal Code, RSC 1985, c C-46.
The appellant was 17 years old at the time of the offence and was sentenced as a youth under the Youth Criminal Justice Act, SC 2002, c 1 [YCJA].
The appellant was sentenced to an 18-month custody and supervision order: 12 months to be served in secured custody, followed by 6 months of community supervision.
[2] The appellant appeals both his conviction and sentence.
The appellant contends the trial judge made errors in assessing the credibility of the witnesses and that he received ineffective trial representation.
The appellant also submits the sentence is unfit as it contradicts the principles, purpose and provisions of the YCJA, which support imposing non-custodial sentences for youth offenders.
[3] For reasons on which I will elaborate, the conviction appeal is dismissed.
BACKGROUND of proceedings [4] Due to the significant length of time it took to conclude the proceedings for this offence, a brief overview of the timeline is necessary.
[5] The incident that gave rise to the charges against the appellant occurred on or about November 25, 2012.","The applicants applied for an order of certiorari to quash the portion of the order of the Labour Relations Board which found that the applicants engaged in an unfair labour practice within the meaning of s43 of the Trade Union Act by failing to provide the Union and Minister of Labour with notice of technological change.
The applicants challenged the decision of the Labour Relations Board as being patently unreasonable and that the word removal as found in s43(1)(c) read separately or in conjunction with the remainer of the section could not reasonably be interpreted to include closure of a business or part thereof so as to constitute a technological change within the meaning of s43.
HELD: The portion of the order which found that the applicants engaged in an unfair labour practice was quashed.
The matter was remitted to the Labour Relations Board to be dealt with having regard to the finding that the closure of the vacuum division is not a 'technological change' within the meaning of s43(1)(c) of the Trade Union Act.
1)The Board made a patently unreasonable error.
The issue had been settled by the decision in Regina Exhibition.
Although this decision was now before the Court of Appeal the Court was bound by it.
2)It was not appropriate at this stage to deal with the application for an injunction.

Introduction [1] Daniel Smith was found guilty of the second degree murder of Roger Byer following a trial before a judge and jury.
Mr. Smith was sentenced to life imprisonment with no eligibility for parole for 12 years.
[2] The pivotal evidence implicating Mr. Smith in the murder of Mr. Byer came from the testimony of Mr. Smith’s former common law spouse, Susan Saxon, and his friend, Dwight Windrum.
Defence counsel initially, and quite strongly, argued in favour of its inclusion.
However, after a lengthy exchange between the trial judge and both counsel, defence counsel not only abruptly withdrew his request for a Vetrovec warning, but insisted that it not be given.
[4] In the end, the trial judge did not give a Vetrovec warning in relation to either witness.
In his appeal to this Court, Mr. Smith argues that a Vetrovec warning was mandatory, regardless of the position taken by his counsel at the time of trial.
[5] For the reasons that follow, I would dismiss Mr. Smith’s appeal.
II.
BACKGROUND A.
The facts relating to the death of Mr. Byer [6] Mr. Byer died on or about January 20, 2010.
[8] Mr. Byer’s body was found face down behind his truck.","The mother who had sole custody of the nine year old applied pursuant to s17 of the Divorce Act to vary an order requiring the father to pay $750 as child support and to obtain an order for maintenance in accordance with the Federal Child Support Guidelines.
The mother argued the father should not be allowed to deduct all of the interest or any of the capital cost associated with his rental income.
HELD: 1)The father was to pay monthly child support of $754.19, retroactive to September 1/98.
The father's annual net rental income of $2,937.69 and a portion of his living allowance deemed to be income were added to his gross annual employment income.
2)The father was to pay one-half of all extracurricular activities within 60 days of receiving the receipts and one half of orthodontist's costs to the extent they are not covered by the petitioner's dental plan.","[9, 7, 11, 2, 3, 8, 4, 10, 12, 5, 13, 14, 19]"
835,"As stated at the conclusion of the trial, in the court’s view, Mr. Ziola and Mr. Petrie are equally credible witnesses.
Two reasonable and honest men can easily disagree on what one may have said to the other or what one meant when they said something to the other.
Such circumstances have led Mr. Ziola and Mr. Petrie to become entangled in a lawsuit respecting the sale of three quarters of land in the Rural Municipality of Hazel Dell.
Regrettably, notwithstanding the good intentions of the Petrie and Ziola families, their interaction through the bidding and post-bidding process has entangled them in a three and one-half year disagreement, resulting in this lawsuit.
[4] Mr. Ziola maintains that after the bidding process closed Mr. Petrie agreed to sell him three quarters of land; Mr. Petrie denies such a deal was struck.
[5] The parties have brought before the court the initial question of liability.
Proof of damages will follow if the court finds that an agreement was created.
[6] Mr. Ziola states that the central issue in this lawsuit is the application of the Statute of Frauds to the land sale agreement.
Mr. Ziola states that all the requisite elements of a valid land sale are present.","FIAT. The accused, charged with trafficking in a narcotic, sought an order for a judicial stay of proceedings pursuant to s.24(1) and (2) of the Charter on the basis his right under s.11(b) to be tried within a reasonable time has been breached.
HELD: The application was dismissed.
The delay was not unreasonable.
 1)The 25 months between when the charge was laid in May 1996 and the trial date in November 1998 was sufficiant delay to raise the issue of the reasonableness of the delay.
Defence did not waive delay. 2)There was no reason given for the three and one-half month delay between the swearing of the information and the arrest.
The accused's right to a fair trial had not been prejudiced by the total time delay.
His right to security of person and to liberty were not affected.
3)Seven months delay was due to scheduling delays resulting from defence's application to remove prosecution counsel who had previously represented the accused.
The Crown acted in good faith in opposing the application and had a meritorious position.
4)All other proceedings were within the systemic guidelines.
5)Prejudice to his liberty was minor as he was on bail since shortly after his arrest.
He was able to make full answer and defence.
He was employed throughout since his release.
His inability to enter long term contracts or travel out of province would have existed for 21-1/2 months of the 25 month delay in any event. 6)Individual and family stress is to be expected.
The minor prejudice beyond the normal and expected was not sufficient to outweigh society's interest in bringing those charged with criminal offences to trial.","[2, 4, 12, 15, 5, 20, 18, 16, 11]"
836,"I. introduction [1] After trial, a judge convicted Larry Hayter of one count of fraud over $5,000, contrary to s. 380(1)(a) of the Criminal Code.

background [4] The facts are procedural and may be explained briefly.
Mr. Hayter requested adjournments before, during and after his trial.
At the commencement of trial, Mr. Hayter’s counsel requested an adjournment because Mr. Hayter’s wife had been hospitalised and could not attend court.
There was no mention of Mr. Hayter’s wife testifying or as being a material witness.
[5] The judge stepped down for ten minutes to consider the request.
Mr. Hayter’s counsel suggested another judicial centre and the judge checked to see if an earlier date could be secured elsewhere.
No other judicial centre could offer an earlier trial date.
While expressing sympathy for Mr. Hayter’s situation, the judge denied his adjournment request.
[6] Following this, the trial proceeded for the morning session, with the Crown leading a witness in examination-in-chief.","FIAT. The parties entered a custody and maintenance agreement with respect to the one child of their common law relatinship in 1989.
The mother moved with the daughter to British Columbia in 1997.
The parties did not agree upon ongoing access.
HELD: The father's generous and far reaching requests were not reasonable at this time given his lengthy non-contact.
It was important that he be reintroduced to his 10 year old daughter in a gradual and consistent fashion.
He was granted access intitially for three and four hours in both provinces, then two days at the father's parent's home including overnight access and two days in the summer in British Columbia.

The appellant had his appeal denied on the grounds that the decision of the Hearing Officer was not patently unreasonable.
Allowing the appeal and remitting the matter for re-hearing, that an appeal from a Hearing Officer to the Tribunal is a statutory appeal.
It is not a judicial review, and the standard of review is therefore one of correctness not whether or not the Hearing Officer's decision was patently unreasonable.

The defendant declined to give an assignment of any accident injury settlement he might receive from SGI and requested the bank direct Equifax to eliminate any references to his default or delinquency upon the bank loans.
The bank offered to put an explanatory note on their credit report confirming the arrears were the result of the defendant's automobile accident and that he had undertaken to pay the bank from the proceeds of the accident settlement.
The bank commenced this action for payment.
The Compains sought general, punitive, exemplary and aggravated damages in a counterclaim for breach of the bank's duty of good faith, duty of confidentiality and breach of contract.
HELD: The counterclaims were dismissed with taxed costs to the bank for both the claim and counterclaims.
The bank's claim was admitted at trial.
1)Compain expressly waived any contractual rights which he had to confidentiality of his credit information by the provisions of paragraph 8 of the Personal Credit Line Agreement.
The principles outlined by the English Court of appeal in Tournier enumerated four exceptions to a bank's confidentiality obligation to its customers. 2)The analogy between the insurance cases and a bank and borrowing customer was not complete or appropriate.
Assuming, without deciding, that banks do have a duty of good faith and fair dealing towards their customers, the bank did not breach such duties in their dealings in this case.
3)The characterization of the accounts as collection accounts was fair, reasonable and accurate in the circumstances and were not out of the normal course of business.","[9, 5, 7, 2, 10, 8, 12, 11, 0, 14, 13, 4, 16, 3, 18, 21]"

On August 25, 1992, Cheryl was delivered of her baby by caesarian section, following what has been described as an uneventful and even excellent pregnancy.
The defendant, Dr. Gerry P. Urbanski (""Dr. Urbanski"") who had performed the caesarian section delivery operation, was called in and attended to Cheryl's needs.
When satisfied that they had contained the bleeding and stabilized Cheryl as best they could under the exigent circumstances, she was transferred to the intensive care unit, where she could be closely monitored and followed.
However, on October 3, 1992, it became obvious that hemorrhaging had recurred.
THE ISSUESThe hysterectomy is the primary source of the problem in this case.
Cheryl alleges that Dr. Urbanski was negligent in the performance of his professional duties and services upon her with the result that the hysterectomy, which could otherwise have been avoided, became inevitable.
Cheryl accordingly seeks damages from the defendant for her irretrievable loss, as well as for the pain and suffering resulting from her treatment and surgery.

Revenue Canada objected, requesting a conditional order for monthly payments of $750 over 4 years.
HELD: Conditional order of discharge granted.
The court found that the bankrupt was 43 years old, in good health and with no dependents.
The bankrupt was also a self-employed contractor with an 'enviable' income.
Following a review of the bankrupt's financial material on file, the court ordered the bankrupt to pay $500 per month for 3 years, to make regular installment payments on his self-employment income and comply with tax filing requirements.","[1, 3, 15, 2, 4, 0, 13, 6, 16, 9, 20, 29, 11]"

This is an appeal from an order setting aside, as premature, an order of the Labour Relations Board directing that a vote be held to determine which of two unions should represent the employees of the Eastend Wolf Willow Heath Centre (the ""Centre"").
It was undisputed that the long term intent was this integration.
The application to the Board, by of the appellant C.U.P.E.
to determine if it represented a majority of the employees, was made under s. 37 of The Trade Union Act, R.S.S.","FIAT. The applicant sought an order pursuant to s.87 and s.251 of the Land Titles Act cancelling the existing certificate of Title in the names of the deceased and herself as tenants in common and directing the Land Titles Registrar to issue a new title in their joint names with right of survivorship.
The deceased and applicant who had been living together purchased residential property in 1997.
Their lawyer prepared a written agreement for the sellers and purchasers as well as the mortgage describing the purchasers as joint tenants.
The sellers, unrepresented by legal counsel, prepared the transfer of the property and title issued without the words 'joint tenants'.
The error describing the purchasers went unnoticed by their lawyer.
The respondent had been married to the deceased when he died intestate in 1998.
As the title stood an undivided one-half interest was owned by the estate and would devolve to the respondent pursuant to the Intestate Succession Act.
HELD: The Land Titles Office Registrar was to amend the existing certificate of title by inserting 'joint tenants' after the names of the registered owners.
1)The requirements set out in Bank of Nova Scotia v. Rochon were satisfied.
There was an obvious mistake which required rectification.
The deceased and the applicant intended to purchase the property as joint tenants and instructed their lawyer accordingly.
The lawyer acknowledged that it was a mistake that the title issued as it did.
2)Although the applicant had an alternate remedy of seeking damages for any loss from her conveyance lawyer, damages were not a reasonably convenient remedy in this case as title would remain registered in the names of strangers, neither of whom could be compelled to sell to the other.","[1, 2, 3, 4, 9, 8, 10, 6, 0]"

NATURE OF CLAIM[6] The plaintiffs claim damages for loss of benefits and base their claims on systemic negligence, breach of trust, breach of fiduciary duty, and unjust enrichment.
THE CAA[8] Under the CAA a “class” is defined as two or more persons with common issues respecting a cause of action or a potential cause of action.
Common issues are defined as:(a) common but not necessarily identical issues of fact; or(b) common but not necessarily identical issues of law that arise from common but not necessarily identical facts.
[10] Certain matters are not a bar to certification.
There are no pleadings to support the existence of any vicarious liability;(iii) All of the claims are out of time and statute barred by virtue of The Limitation of Actions Act, R.S.S.
CAUSE OF ACTION[12] I do not intend to deal with all of the submissions by the Crown that the plaintiffs’ pleadings fail to disclose a cause of action.","A wife claimed part of the estate of her estranged husband.
The Court considered the applicability of the Testator's Family Maintenance Act, the Matrimonial Property Act, and the Pension Benefits Act.
Awarding the plaintiff $285,000 out of the $3 million estate,
that under the Testator's Family Maintenance Act the claimant need not show actual or urgent need or true dependency in order to succeed.
To justify interference with a will a court must find a failure to provide proper maintenance and support and a moral claim to entitlement.
The court must consider the magnitude of the estate, the circumstances of the claimant, the strength of his or her moral claim to a share in the estate, and the situation of others having claims upon the testator.
This involves a very broad judicial discretion.
Here, the plaintiff had established a strong moral claim and a failure to provide proper maintenance.","[0, 6, 1, 21, 13, 18, 22, 24, 29, 33]"

March 28, 2007[1] A caveat registered by Robert G. Brick (“Mr.
Brick”) was removed as a result of the notice to lapse procedure.
The notice to lapse process was commenced under the old land titles system and completed after conversion to the new land titles system.
Mr.
Brick and a related company now apply for a declaration that the caveat was wrongfully removed by the Registrar of Titles (“Registrar”) and that the caveat be reinstated retroactively to the date of its removal.

FACTS[2] Mr.
Brick registered a caveat against the mineral title of the subject land on November 3, 1972.
The caveat purported to be based upon a right to receive royalties from all gas, oil and carbon products produced from the land.
The caveat was lapsed by the land owner in 1974.
In 1975 the land owner consented to the re‑registration of the caveat.
However, for reasons unknown, the caveat was not re‑registered at that time.","The appellant appealed a preliminary decision of the Nova Scotia Utility and Review Board which held that it had jurisdiction to hear an assessment appeal where, although the appellant failed to comply with the service requirement of s. 86(1) of the Assessment Act, the party not properly served waived the requirement.

1985, c. B-3 setting aside the decision of the registrar dated July 20, 2006, upholding the disallowance of the claim of Pioneer Grain Company Limited, as a secured creditor in the proposal of Shane Paul Sabourin.
Additionally, the applicant seeks an order pursuant to Rule 30(2) of the general rules under the Bankruptcy and Insolvency Act under s. 187(11) of The Bankruptcy and Insolvency Act extending the time for the bringing of this appeal.
[2] On the occasion of the hearing, counsel for the respondent, Sullivan & Associates Inc., consented to the extension of the time for the bringing of the appeal, and accordingly the issue relates to whether the applicant has demonstrated a basis for the order sought under Rule 30(1) of the Bankruptcy and Insolvency Act.
[3] By way of background, on February 3, 2004, Shane Paul Sabourin granted Pioneer Grain Company Limited a security interest in all of his present and after acquired property.
Pioneer Grain Company Limited then filed a proof of claim in the proposal of Shane Paul Sabourin setting forth their position as a secured creditor based on a security agreement dated February 3, 2004.","FIAT. The plaintiff applied for summary judgment in his claim for dismissal without just cause.
The plaintiff was initially hired as body shop foreman but additionally acquired the title of assistant manager.
When the body shop manager became ill that work load also fell to the plaintiff.
It was during this period that the performance of the plaintiff, described by the defendant as serious misconduct, resulted in his termination.
There was no issue of a lack of mitigation as the plaintiff accepted a job with another autobody shop but at a much lower rate of pay.
The action was brought pursuant to the simplified procedure outlined in Part 40 of the Rules of Court.
HELD: Damages were to be calculated by the parties for the 7 month notice period based on his income and value of benefits over the previous year, less the 6 weeks pay received, and less wages and benefits received from his new employment.
Jurisdiction was reserved to hear further evidence should the parties not reach agreement. 1)By using the words 'shall grant judgment unless', Rule 488 requires the presiding judge to grant judgment except in the circumstances outlined in s.488(a)and(b).
The test is not whether there is contradictory evidence in the affidavits but whether despite the contradictory evidence the issue(s) can be decided in the absence of cross-examination and it would be otherwise unjust to do so.
If the court can assume the defendant's evidence is true and still grant summary judgment there is no genuine need for a trial. 2)As noted in numerous decisions, whether an employer is justified in summarily dismissing an employee is ultimately a question of fact.
The plaintiff was not terminated because of poor job performance in performing his contractual duties as foreman and manager but because of his alleged poor performance in doing the job normally assigned to two persons.
The employer has the right to expect that employees will not disparage their immediate supervisors or other employees in the course of their employment and certainly not to clients or customers of the employer.
The type of conduct here would not justify dismissal the first time it came to the employer's attention if the employee had been guilty of such conduct while performing only his own job function.
'Griping' is not uncommon in the workplace.
The case law seems uniform that one or more warnings to an employee must be given before it can be said such activity 'fractures the employment relationship'.
The category of misconduct can be said to change from poor attitude to disobedience or insubordination where dismissal results after one or more warnings.
3)The plaintiff was entitled to 7 months notice to reflect the fact that junior management positions are fewer in number and the considerable wage difference between management and non- management positions.
 4)The plaintiff was entitled to taxable costs.","[0, 1, 4, 3, 6, 5, 7]"

[2] Mr. Dorosh sought to alter custody in 1997.
Mr. Justice McIntyre rendered a judgment upon that application on July 31, 1997.
The terms of the 1995 judgment prescribe that Ms. Antonowitsch, is the sole custodian of Letitia.
The matter never proceeded to trial.
[3] On January 20, 2003, Mr. Dorosh again applied for variation of the 1995 judgment.
[4] Letitia was then 13 years old.
[6] This application finally proceeded to be argued before Madam Justice Dawson on January 21, 2004.
A written decision was rendered on January 26, 2004.
That fiat has a direct bearing upon the present application and therefore the text is set forth and read as follows:Wayne Dorosh applies to vary the custody and child support order of May 2, 1995.
The assessment and/or conclusion of the assessor is contained on page 5: Letitia treasures both of her parents, and is able to benefit from each relationship’s strengths to the fullest.
Letitia appeared very genuine in her desire to spend increased time with her father, and indicates the flexibility that has been recently added to the access schedule is exactly what she desired.
It appears that Letitia has access to Mr. Dorosh when she requests it and at the times that are convenient to Letitia.
Mr. Dorosh acknowledges that this type of access is agreeable to him.","The accused was charged with assault causing bodily harm contrary to s.267(b) of the Criminal Code.
HELD: The accused was found guilty.
 1)The case law from other jurisdictions was reviewed.
Given the law as it presently stands in Saskatchewan the Crown does not have an obligation to prove that bodily harm caused by the assault was objectively foreseeable and that the assault would subject the victim to the risk of bodily harm.
The Court of Appeal expressly stated that R. v. Nurse was incorrectly decided and prefers the approach in R. v. Brooks which held the elements of assault causing bodily harm consist of the mens rea to commit the assault and the intentional application of force which results in bodily harm.
2)The victim would not have suffered bodily harm if the accused had not assaulted him.
The assault was more than an insignificant or trivial cause of the bodily harm.
While the bodily harm resulted directly from third parties falling on top of the accused and the victim, the third parties involvement was due entirely and as a direct result of the actions of the accused.
It was clearly the accused who initiated the pile up.
The accused placed the victim in a dangerous position, similar to that in the Samuelson and Brooks decisions.
A very short period of time elapsed between the assault and bodily harm.","[1, 0, 5, 10, 13, 9, 11, 6, 18, 22, 17, 19, 29, 30, 27]"

The trial judge found the plaintiff's evidence to be lacking in credibility and found that the collision did not contribute materially to the plaintiff's poor health.
It only caused a mild aggravation of her pre-existing and major back problem.
The trial judge assessed general damages at $25,000.
The plaintiff's costs were reduced on the basis that she refused a formal offer to settle for slightly less than what she was awarded and refused a second offer which was increased before trial to an amount in excess of what she was awarded.
The plaintiff appealed and the defendant cross-appealed.
Appeal and cross-appeal dismissed.
No strong and cogent reasons were advanced to warrant interference with the trial judge's findings on credibility.
There was ample evidence to support the conclusion that the accident only caused a mild aggravation of the pre-existing condition and thus no basis upon which court could interfere with that conclusion or adjust upwards general damage assessment.
Trial judge applied no wrong principle in exercising discretion to reduce plaintiff's costs.

FACTS [2] In 1995 Neil Hudson, spouse of the applicant, Lois Hudson, with assistance from some of his children, who are now plaintiffs, retained Celine-Rose J. Polischuk of the law firm, Politeski Strilchuk & Milen for the purpose of having his wife, Lois Hudson admitted for treatment pursuant to The Mental Health Services Act.
At that time Neil Hudson collected some personal letters, records and computer printouts (documents) prepared by Lois Hudson and delivered them to Ms. Polischuk.
They were forwarded by her to Peter T. Johnson, Q.C., then solicitor for Lois Hudson.
[3] In 1998, the plaintiffs, some of whom are children or spouses of children of Lois Hudson commenced a defamation action against her.
The documents are material in the present litigation.
The same information as contained in the documents, although perhaps in some other form, was available to the plaintiffs from other sources.
ISSUES 1.
What was the relationship between Lois Hudson and the law firm of Politeski Strilchuk & Milen when the documents were delivered to them?
If a solicitor-client relationship did not exist what duty, if any, was owed to Lois Hudson?","The grievor was employed in the front desk department of a hotel and her hours of work were reduced when another employee from the same department returned from maternity leave.
The latter had greater departmental seniority than the grievor but less hotel seniority.
The grievor filed a grievance claiming that under the collective agreement any such reduction of hours of individual employees should be based on hotel seniority, rather than departmental seniority.
The arbitrator upheld the grievance and the hotel applied for judicial review.
Application allowed;
the arbitrator's interpretation of the collective agreement was patently unreasonable and her award should be set aside.
The court's focus must be on the existence of a rational basis for the decision of the tribunal and not on whether it agrees with the decision.
Although there was evidentiary support for the arbitrator's essential findings of fact, no logical process could be ascertained by which the final conclusion drawn from the evidentiary foundation was made.","[0, 1, 4, 2, 7, 6, 9, 8, 10, 5, 12, 11, 14]"

This is the standard of review prescribed in the parties’ interspousal contract of September 14, 1999.
Under that agreement the husband pays $3,000 per month in spousal support.
[2] The parties are at odds as to whether the husband has experienced an increase in income and whether the wife’s needs have been affected by cohabitation with a new partner.
[3] The husband’s position is summarized in his affidavit as follows: 5.
...I own a 36% interest in a trucking company called “Titan Transport Ltd.” As a result of a general downturn in the economy during the year 2001, the profits of Titan Transport have been significantly reduced.
This decline was exacerbated by the events in New York and Washington on September 11, 2001.
As a result of this economic decline our company closed the Winnipeg Branch and laid off two employees in our Calgary office.
Our accountant calculates that the company's bottom line has declined by 62% from between the year end 2000 and the year end 2001.

He applied under the Freedom of Information and Protection of Privacy Act for certain information concerning these allegations.
The FOIPOP Privacy Coordinator denied access and the applicant appealed.
Appeal allowed; in all cases where the claimants had signed release forms the applicant is to be supplied with information as to the number and nature of allegations made against him and the names of the complainants; the specific dates and times of all allegations made against him; the evidence collected in relation to the investigations undertaken as a result of the allegations; the number and dollar amount of payouts made for actions attributable only to the applicant; and information as to whether any of the allegations leveled were dismissed or unproven.
The appeal should proceed as an appeal de novo.
The applicant was not seeking information from R.C.M.P. files and the release of information which the police had passed on to the Department of Justice would not harm law enforcement as the information was compiled by the Province for its own purposes.
The complainants had been required to execute releases whereby the information supplied could be used for various specified purposes, all of which potentially involved public disclosure or disclosure to the applicant.
Law enforcement protection was lost when a release was obtained from the complainants and the information was passed to the Province.
There was no unreasonable invasion of the claimants' privacy.
The applicant was entitled to know what he had been accused of and should have the right to correct the record.","[0, 1, 2, 4, 6, 7, 9, 8, 3, 13, 15, 11, 14, 12, 10]"

March 23, 1998[1] Denby Elizabeth Royal, presently 10 years of age, is a child of the common law relationship of the parties.
[2] After Denby's parents separated they entered into a Custody and Maintenance Agreement on June 22, 1989.
[3] On page 4 of the Agreement the parties agreed as follows: 5.
Duration of Agreement(a) The parties agree that it is in the best interests of the child that the Father and the child continue to have contact and access with each other and that the Father continue to pay maintenance as set forth herein, regardless of the marriage of the Father or the Mother to, or the adoption of the child by, someone other than the Father or the Mother.
[4] Subsequent to entering into this Agreement the relationship between the parties at best can only be described as tumultuous.
Jodi-Lin married for a short period of time and in August, 1997 she moved to Nelson, British Columbia with Denby.
By that time David Wolbaum had not seen his daughter for almost three years.
[5] The first time Denby saw her father in over three years was last December.
An Order for specified access was made by McIntyre J. to facilitate two access visits while she was in Regina.","The accused was convicted of having care or control of a motor vehicle while impaired (Criminal Code s.253(a)) but acquitted on the charge under s.253(b).
The Provincial Court trial judge did not accept the accused's testimony that his blood-alcohol concentration was between .068 and .081 at the time of driving.
On appeal the Queen's Bench judge set aside the conviction and ordered an acquittal.
HELD: The appeal was allowed.
The Queen's Bench judgment was set aside and the Provincial Court trial judgment was restored.
While the appellate judge stated the correct standard of review, he did not in fact apply it and made inaccurate assessments of the evidence and conclusion of the trial judge.","[0, 1, 2, 4, 5, 3, 6, 7, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 8]"

May 27, 1996The applicant brings this motion for interim spousal maintenance.
The parties separated in the summer of 1994.
They were divorced by order dated December 21, 1995.
All other issues raised in the divorce proceeding were left in abeyance including the issue of spousal maintenance.
The petitioner and the applicant agreed December 15, 1994 that he would pay her $3,000.00 per month which sum included support for their son Michael as well as her.
According to the applicant's affidavit the petitioner has since reduced the monthly amounts down to $1,500.00 for each of the months of September through December of 1995.
Since then the petitioner has ""unilaterally"", according to the applicant reduced the monthly support to $1,000.00 per month and even those have been irregular and not on time.
Up until April 26 of this year the applicant says she has received only a total of $3,000.00.
None of these allegations are refuted.","The 18 year old, charged with the second degree murder of two individuals, applied for release from custody.
HELD: The accused was released on his own undertakings under a set of strict conditions, including participation in an electronic monitoring program.
The onus is on the accused to show cause why his detention in custody is not justified.
Criminal Code s.515(10) now permits detention on three grounds.
His detention was not necessary to ensure his attendance at court nor for the protection or safety of the public.
There was no evidence he posed a substantial likelihood of committing further offences or that he would interfere with the administration of justice if released.
There was no other just cause, including maintenance of confidence in the administration of justice.","[0, 1, 2, 4, 5, 6, 3, 7, 9, 8, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14]"

He argued that he had a reasonable excuse to refuse based on his medical condition of anxiety attacks at the time of blowing.
HELD: 1)This case is similar to the Alberta Court of Appeal decision in Topp which stated the accused must not conceal his reasons for refusing to give breath samples.
The case has to be decided on the basis of what the police knew or could readily surmise, not on the hidden facts, which the accused had not disclosed.
The New Brunswick case of R. v. Dunnett canvassed the law with respect to s.10(b) rights and cited four factors arising from recent SCC decisions concerning detained or arrested person's right to a lawyer.
Granted the accused was charged with refusal 51 minutes after the demand for the breath tests, even though he was diligent in attempting to reach counsel, he was not diligent in pursuing his rights after he unsuccessfully tried to contact a lawyer three times.
It is not a police officer's obligation to go further if the accused does not appreciate the advice of Legal Aid counsel.
2)His evidence was not believed as to the anxiety attacks.
The intoxilyzer did not register because he was not breathing properly into the mouthpiece.
He provided an adequate supply of air in the roadside screening device about an hour prior.
The statement of law enunciated in Pederson out of the Yukon Territory Supreme Court was adopted.
It could not be concluded on the evidence that his respiratory problems made it impossible to provide a sample.
The doctor stated he could do so when his breathing returned to normal as did the accused.
Further an accused who is aware of what triggers his anxiety attacks, for example a hard night of drinking the night before, and continues to drink alcohol and operate a motor vehicle cannot be later heard to say and hope to avoid conviction that the refusal was a result of a known medical condition.
He should not drink and drive.","[0, 2, 4, 1, 6, 3, 8, 5, 7, 10, 9, 13, 12, 11, 22, 21, 23, 24, 14, 18, 16, 15, 17, 30, 34]"

I note that despite having obtained a provisional order and a promotion the applicant has not paid any support since obtaining that order.","The Credit Union loaned $37,700 upon security, inter alia, of a 1999 Chevrolet Blazer owned by McMillan.
A security agreement was registered at the Personal Property Security Registry in September 2000 and re-registered in November 2001.
After McMillan died in June 2001, payments fell into arrears and a demand was made for possession of the Blazer.
His widow, the respondent, was shown as co-buyer on the purchase agreement but was never the registered owner until she acquired it from her husband's estate.
She sought to defeat the security interest on the grounds she was the real owner at all times, made the payments and was always in possession.
At issue was whether the registered owner of a vehicle has the power to grant a security interest enforceable in priority to the interest of a person whose claim, though substantial, is not registered or otherwise of record in any place where the lender has or should have notice of it.
HELD: The claim of the Credit Union was enforceable.
Judicial notice was taken of the fact there is no title registry in Saskatchewan other than that maintained by Saskatchewan Government Insurance.
The licensing function was assigned to SGI under the Vehicle Administration Act.
That Act and the Highway Traffic Act are clear the person named in a registration certificate is regarded as the owner of the vehicle.
Motor vehicles are unique in that their registration creates a presumption of ownership and follows a declaration of ownership by the registry.
Reliance upon the registration system is an important facet of our commerce and would create chaos if reliance is taken away.
Ownership does not depend upon registration.
However, once a vehicle is registered following a declaration of ownership, a presumption arises in favour of the holder of the registration certificate and as a matter of commercial efficacy lenders, the police, insurers, repairmen, etc. are justified in relying upon the certificate as proof of ownership.
A transfer of ownership would defeat the Credit Union's claim only if it were undertaken for value and with notice.
No costs were awarded on either motion.","[0, 2, 3, 1, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8]"

The general rule that a lapsed gift falls into the residue is expressly subject to any contrary intention appearing in the will; a class gift always expresses such a contrary intention.
Where the gift is to a class of close relatives (e.g. to children), if this is a class gift it does not fall under this statutory exception.
In such a case, the gift falls to the surviving members of the class.
This case satisfied two of the exceptions to the class rule, namely, that the number of beneficiaries was given and that the names of such were given.

stands charged that on September 26, 2006 at the City of Saskatoon, Saskatchewan, he did commit an assault on [A.G.], contrary to Section 266 of the Criminal Code.
[2] On the trial date, the Crown applied to have admitted in evidence oral statements made by the complainant to her neighbour and to the police on September 26, 2006 for consideration of the truth of their contents.
Evidence was then called on a voir dire.
[3] This application is pursuant to a line of cases which create an exception to the rule which presumptively excludes hearsay evidence.
In accord with these cases, hearsay statements may be admitted on a principled basis, the governing principles being reliability and necessity.
The Facts[4] The facts are relatively straight-forward.
The complainant, [A.G.], is the common- law spouse of the accused and had been for seven years.

At the conclusion of the trial, the defence brought a motion to exclude the certificate of analysis as the demand flowed from an invalid approved screening device demand.
HELD: The defence application to exclude the certificate of analysis based on a breach of s. 8 and s. 9 of the Charter was granted.
There being no evidence upon which to convict in regard to the .08 charge, it was dismissed.
 1) The Court found a distinction between 'had consumed alcohol' and 'has alcohol in the person's body'.
The Court found the words 'had consumed alcohol' to be insufficient for the Court to conclude that the officer had a reasonable suspicion there was alcohol in the accused's body at the time of the demand.
2) There was no objective basis upon which a reasonable suspicion of alcohol in the body could be made.
The evidence of alcohol on the breath was not reliable in the circumstances of this case.
The admission of having had her last drink was possibly made after the demand and could not be relied on to formulate the required reasonable suspicion.
The evidence of bloodshot eyes, empty beer bottles in a plastic bag with three persons in the car and the smell of alcohol coming from the vehicle could not alone support a reasonable conclusion of reasonable suspicion of alcohol in the body of the motorist.","[2, 1, 5, 0, 8, 6, 7, 9, 4, 13, 12, 11, 15, 14, 16, 3]"

The text of the letter is as follows:ALEX Hey Dude!

Why am I asking you?
Well honestly, I don't have no friends.
I'm totally on my own here.","The mother was unable to care for the child and the father, who had been convicted of sexual assault, was only entitled to supervised access.
Both the paternal and maternal grandmothers presented plans of care to the court, with the paternal grandmother seeking custody and the maternal grandmother seeking care and control of the child.
The child had a younger sibling who was in the maternal grandmother's custody and her daughter, the mother of the child, supported the plan of the maternal grandmother.
The Agency supported the paternal grandmother.
Custody granted to the paternal grandmother with reasonable access to the maternal grandmother and supervised access to the parents.
The paternal grandmother was better able to care for the child financially and her circumstances were such that it was in the child's best interests to grant her custody.
The issue of separation of siblings was only one factor in considering an alternative (relative) placement; the children were very young and there was no evidence of a bond between them.","[1, 0, 5, 6, 2, 4, 3, 7, 10, 8, 14, 13, 12, 15, 17, 11, 9, 18, 16, 20, 19]"
864,"JUDGMENT P.S.
KOLENICK, JBACKGROUND [1] The accused is charged that he did, on or about November 29, 2010, at Saskatoon, commit common assault against the complainant contrary to s. 266 of the Criminal Code.
The issue which has arisen is whether the evidence of the Crown is sufficiently credible to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the only physical contact he had on the complainant was for the purpose of defending himself from the alleged aggression of the complainant.
Related to that was whether, on the evidence the Crown was able to prove non-consent beyond a reasonable doubt.
Regardless, the accused bears no onus whatsoever in these proceedings.
[2] For roughly two months prior to this alleged matter, the complainant, age 17, had lived in a blended family with her father as well as, the accused and his mother.
A disagreement arose between the accused and the female complainant when he had accidentally allowed the baby to slip from his grasp while removing him from the Jolly Jumper.
The child had struck the floor, but suffered no injury, and was quickly comforted.
The actions of the accused had been unintentional with no harm to the baby.
Despite that, it led to a sharp verbal exchange, as the circumstances between the parties deteriorated, leading to more.","The plaintiff brought an action against the defendants for breach of contract in regard to the defendants' refusal to return to her the substantial security deposit that she paid as part of a motel lease.
After being clearly told that the money would not be returned, she waited 9 years before commencing the action.
The plaintiff applied for an order disallowing the defendants' limitation defence.
Application to disallow the limitation defence dismissed; plaintiff's action dismissed.
The plaintiff's evidence did not show any valid reason for such a lengthy delay and the defendants thought that all outstanding issues with the plaintiff had long since been settled.
Not only was there a presumption that the evidence would now be less cogent than it would have been, but the defendants' storage warehouse was destroyed by fire 3 years ago resulting in the loss of many old records, including those relating to the motel.","[6, 2, 7, 5, 9, 11, 4, 3, 10, 12]"

Contrary to the wording of their separation agreement, the husband argued that they had agreed that spousal support would only be payable for one year as the wife needed extra income from a secure source in order to obtain a mortgage on a new home.
Also at issue was the husband's obligation to provide the wife with an automobile pursuant to the separation agreement.
Spousal support to continue at the rate set out in the separation agreement for a period of fifteen months from the date of the decision at which time all support shall terminate, unless, prior to the termination date, the wife commences an application which results in her showing cause why spousal support should continue; the husband has complied with his obligations with respect to the provision of an automobile.
The wife's financial means and needs required support, the husband had made an agreement to provide such support and the evidence did not support a conclusion that it was agreed to be for only one year.
Although the wife did not establish any disadvantage from the marriage, there were disadvantages relating to its breakdown and her lifestyle deteriorated as result of the marriage ending.","[0, 6, 5, 1, 8, 12, 16, 14, 9, 18, 17, 20, 2, 25, 23, 11, 21, 26, 29, 19, 28, 33, 10, 13, 32, 22]"

[2] The Crown did not pursue the first count, but did launch an appeal as to the second count.
The grounds of appeal are two in number:1.
That the learned trial judge erred in law by holding that the Respondent’s s. 10(b) Charter right was violated.
2.
That the learned trial judge erred in law by excluding evidence pursuant to s. 24(2) of the Charter.
Upon a review of the facts and circumstances and the law, I reject both grounds of appeal.
THE FACTS[3] On October 22, 2010, the accused travelled from his hometown of Carlyle, Saskatchewan, to Alida, Saskatchewan.
While there, he consumed five to seven drinks.
who was on patrol at the time.
It appears the accused had some difficulty locating the licence.
The constable found this strange because he believed the licence was easily visible.
However, he may have been mistaken.
The document he observed may have been a form of government identification.

There was no other observable sign of impairment.

Joint custody awarded for all four children, with the father to have primary care and control of the oldest and the mother to have primary care and control of the three younger children; the father is to pay child support for three children in the guideline amount and the mother is to pay child support for one child in the guideline amount; the husband's equity in the matrimonial home is frozen at the amount owing on the mortgage when the parties separated and his interest is postponed until the youngest child reaches the age of 21 years; if the wife wishes to obtain a new home in a new location, she will be required to pay out the husband's equity in the matrimonial home.","[4, 6, 3, 5, 8, 7, 0, 17, 14, 19, 9, 18, 23, 20, 25, 21, 28, 11]"

With respect to this alleged offence, the Crown must prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the offence has been committed, and if the Crown proves on that basis that the offence has been committed, then it’s open to the accused, and necessary for the accused, to establish on a balance of probabilities that he took such reasonable steps as were necessary to prevent the offence from occurring.
[2] The evidence this afternoon indicated and established that there were four separate incidents in September of 2001 involving Mr. Federuik’s dog.
Firstly, on the 9th of September when Mrs. Barks came up the alley towards her house and was frightened by the dog.
Secondly, on the 19th of September on the front steps of Mrs. Barks’ house.
And, fourthly, on the 25th of September when Mr. Federuik’s dog ran through Mrs. Barks’ yard and then was reported to have upset Mr. Zawislak’s daughter.
And the issue, as I’ve indicated, is: Has the Crown proven an attack on any of those four occasions?
Dogs do not go into battle, not in the ordinary sense of that word, and I consider the ordinary sense of that word to be a voluntary intention to be involved in some physically violent act.","The son of unmarried parents, who had graduated from high school, was working part-time, living with his mother and had not made a final decision on a further course of study sustained a serious brain injury just a few months after his 19th birthday.
He required extensive rehabilitation and would not regain his pre-accident physical and intellectual capacity.
The mother successfully applied for a reinstatement of child support which had been discontinued by consent, pre-accident, when the son was residing with the father.
The son, now 23 years old, was upgrading his high school marks at the time of the hearing and hoped to be admitted to a community college program.
The father appealed.
Appeal dismissed;
the judge's decision to award support was not premised upon a finding that, pre-accident, the son had made a clear decision to pursue a further course of study but on the fact that the son intended to pursue his education and had not withdrawn from parental charge at the time of the accident.
There was no evidence to support the allegation that the usual Guideline amount was 'inappropriate' in this case; the Act prohibited the consideration of public income assistance when fixing child support; given the uncertainty about the son's future, this was not an appropriate case for a time-limited order.","[4, 5, 0, 9, 6, 3, 8, 12]"

Hryhorchuk For the Crown Mr. D. Blenner-Hassett For the Accused DECISION S. C. CARTER, J INTRODUCTION: [1] The accused, Craig Lawrence Kendall Weenie, is charged with resisting arrest contrary to s. 129(a) of the Criminal Code.
The defence argues that there were insufficient grounds for the accused’s arrest and that the accused was therefore justified in resisting his detention.
The Crown’s position is that in these circumstances the police were justified in arresting the accused for being drunk in public.
THE FACTS:[2] From the evidence heard at the trial on June 12, 2008, I make the following finding of the facts.
[3] On February 17, 2008 at approximately 7:05 a.m., Cst.
Hayes was dispatched to attend to the apartment complex at Bryant Place in Prince Albert, Saskatchewan for an eviction at Block 4, Suite #1.
While en route the dispatcher called again advising that the person to be evicted was now outside of the apartment banging on the door.
Cst.
Hayes drove into the parking lot, got out of his car and saw the accused on the porch banging at the door.
The accused then began to walk towards Cst.","The appellant was convicted of sexual assault.
The court disbelieved his evidence, principally because it was found to be internally inconsistent.
The court found that the appellant had attempted to portray himself as being good to the children but had admitted on cross-examination that the children had been removed from the home due to allegations of physical abuse and lack of food.
There was no evidence before the court as to the truth of these allegations and the appellant had stated in his evidence that everyone thought that he treated the children badly.
The appellant appealed.
Appeal allowed; conviction set aside; new trial ordered.
The trial judge misapprehended the evidence because she attributed to it a relevance that it could not have in law or in logic.
The appellants evidence about the involvement of Childrens Services did not permit the judge to draw any inference that the children had, in fact, been badly treated or that the appellant was responsible for such treatment.
The misapprehension, examined in the context of the judges reasons as a whole and the entire record was substantial, material and played an essential part in the judges reasoning leading to the conviction; the misapprehension had given rise to a miscarriage of justice.","[2, 1, 3, 4, 5, 9, 6, 7, 8, 0]"

Count 2: That he, on or about the 25th day of August, 2010, at or near Estevan Saskatchewan, did unlawfully possess a controlled substance included in Schedule I to wit: cannabis (marihuana) for the purpose of trafficking, contrary to section 5(3)(a) of the Controlled Drugs and Substances Act.
Count 3: That he, on or about the 25th day of August, 2010, at or near Estevan Saskatchewan, did unlawfully have in his possession property (or proceeds of property), to wit: cash of a value exceeding $5,000.00 knowing that all (or part) of the property was obtained (or derived directly or indirectly) as a result of the commission in Canada of an offence punishable by indictment contrary to section 354 and 355 (a) of the Criminal Code.
[2] A sentencing hearing was subsequently held December 19, 2011 after which the court reserved its sentencing judgment now delivered.
CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE OFFENCE[3] The circumstances of the offences alleged, and to which the accused has now been found guilty, took place in the City of Estevan, Saskatchewan on August 25, 2010.
There they found seven individuals including the accused.
The accused was found in a bedroom at the far end of the house trailer alone and apparently either sleeping or lying on a bed in this bedroom.
He was charged with the offences which he has presently been found guilty.","The plaintiff, who was injured in a rear-end motor vehicle accident, applied for summary judgment and an interim payment of damages.
Application for summary judgment granted; application for interim payment dismissed.
There was no 'air of reality' to the defendant's defence; whether or not the plaintiff's brake lights were working, to strike her vehicle from behind on these facts meant that the defendant was either travelling too close or didn't have enough care and control of his vehicle.
The plaintiff was making a significant claim for damages but she suffered from numerous previous injuries and conditions relating to her health; any damage assessment would depend largely upon credibility and the medical evidence at trial; to assess interim damages in this case would be a most difficult task and would only be a haphazard guess.
The plaintiff's claim was also complicated by the fact that it could possibly be subject to the 'minor injury' cap on damages.","[5, 1, 0, 6, 9, 13, 8, 3, 4]"
870,"[2] The Crown has applied, pursuant to s. 752.1(1) of the Code, for an order remanding Mr. Ben for an assessment performed by an expert for use as evidence in an application to have Mr. Ben declared a dangerous offender.
Defence counsel submits the order should not be made as the predicate offence is not a serious personal injury offence and it is not within the realm of possibility that Mr. Ben could be found to be a dangerous offender.
Is the Predicate Offence a “Serious Personal Injury Offence”?
[4] In order for the assessment order to be made, the Court must be satisfied that the offence is a “serious personal injury offence”, which is defined in section 752 of the Code, the relevant portion of which reads as follows: 752.
The Crown proceeded by indictment and therefore this offence carries a maximum penalty of “a term of not more than 10 years”.
[6] The facts as found after trial were that Cpl.
Hodge had received information that Mr. Ben, who had an outstanding warrant, was at a particular residence.
Cpl.
[7] The officer yelled at the accused to stop and Mr. Ben finally did, about 25 feet away from Cpl.","The respondent had just begun serving the community supervision portion of a custody and supervision order made pursuant to the Youth Criminal Justice Act when he walked away from his designated residence and breached the terms of the order.
The provincial director immediately issued a warrant for his apprehension but he was not found until almost a month later.
His case went to the Youth Court for review under s. 103 of the Act.
The Youth Court judge interpreted the Act as meaning the respondent's sentence had continued to run while he was at large and had expired.
She held that no action was required on the alleged breach of the custody and supervision order.
The Crown appeals the decision.
HELD: Appeal allowed.
1) The Youth Court judge erred in her interpretation of the Act.
On a proper reading of the Act, the respondent was deemed not to be serving his sentence during the time period between when the warrant was issued and when he was apprehended.
2) A straightforward analysis of the Act serves to answer the question of whether the respondent's sentence continued to run while he was at large.
Section 102(1) of the Act sets out the authority of the director, when a young person has breached or is about to breach a condition of his community supervision.
The director may, pursuant to s. 102(1)(a), permit the young person to continue to serve his sentence in the community or, pursuant to s. 102(1)(b) of the Act, if the breach is serious and increases the risk to public safety, the director may order the young person to be remanded in custody until a review is conducted.
Section 102(2) goes on to make s. 107 and s. 108 applicable to an order for remand and review made pursuant to s. 102(1)(b).
Section 107(1) is the provision referred to by s. 102(2) that is of concern.
There is an obvious modification of s. 107(1) which 'the circumstances require' when it applies in the context of a breach of the conditions of community supervision.
That modification involves the notional deletion of the opening words of the subsection that refers to s. 106 and the substitution in their place of a reference to s. 102.
This means two things.
First it means that, when the director decides to issue an order under s. 102(1)(b) remanding a young person in custody until a review is conducted, the director has the authority to issue a warrant authorizing the apprehension of the young person.
Second it means that if a warrant is issued, the young person's sentence does not run until he or she is apprehended. 3)
The court went on to comment further on some of the considerations that seem to have led to the decision in the court below, including the purpose of the Act, the reference to s. 107 that is found in s. 102(2) and the relationship between the concept of the suspension of supervision and the running of the sentence itself.","[2, 3, 8, 7, 1, 9, 14, 10, 5]"

[1] On the hearing of the appeal, the application to adduce fresh evidence and the appeal against conviction were dismissed with brief written reasons to follow.
These are those reasons.
[2] Trevor Drury appeals his conviction for possession for the purpose of trafficking methamphetamine contrary to s. 5(2) of the Controlled Drugs and Substances Act.
[1] His sole ground of appeal hinges on the Court accepting fresh evidence.
[3] The central issue at trial was whether the drugs found at the premises being rented by one Sandra Bodkin belonged to Trevor Drury or to Sandra Bodkin.
In deciding this issue, as part of the overall facts, the trial judge had to determine whether Trevor Drury was renting a part of Sandra Bodkin's basement at the time of the discovery of the methamphetamine.
Mr. Drury denied living in Ms. Bodkin’s basement and denied being a seller of methamphetamine.
Both Ms. Bodkin and Mr. Drury testified.
[4] Scheibel J., the learned trial judge, set forth the evidence and his decision as follows:The central issue is one of credibility.
The Crown's case is based, in large measure, on the evidence of Sandra Bodkin, who was a large drug user at the time of the alleged offence.
She claims that she bought drugs from the accused, and used both marihuana and methamphetamine.","The plaintiff is in the business of buying and selling grain.
The defendant is a farmer.
After calling the plaintiff several times to determine the market price for flax, the defendant agreed to sell the plaintiff 300 metric tonnes of flax of which 297.957 tonnes remain undelivered.
HELD: 1) The defendant did not deliver the balance of the flax before August, 2001 or at anytime and he is in breach of the contract.
2) The verbal contract was in force from the time of the telephone conversation ended in June 2001.
As the price rose, the plaintiff would have profited by $36.50 per tonne.
That is the loss of profit that the plaintiff's claim is based on multiplied by 297.957 and totals $10,875.43.
3) The part performance involving the sale under the contract of 2.043 tonnes is sufficient to meet the requirements of The Sale of Goods Act.","[3, 1, 4, 6, 5, 10, 7, 9, 11, 13, 12, 8]"

2001 Ltd.JUDGMENT KYLE J. February 16, 1996The applicant seeks to have the firm, Robertson Stromberg, barred from acting for the plaintiff by reason of Ms. Schirr, a member of that firm, having been active in representing the defendant, a Crown corporation, during the years prior to 1991 when the defendant changed lawyers following a change of government in Saskatchewan.
This action was commenced after the change of solicitors and there is no suggestion that the subject matter of the action, the contractual issues giving rise to the cause of action, were ever the subject of any consultation between the defendant and its former solicitors.
In 1993 in a similar application respecting another member of the same firm I ruled against the plaintiff.
In so doing I was being consistent with a prior ruling involving a similar attempt to displace the applicant's present solicitors from certain litigation then existing following the 1982 change of government.","The plaintiff sues the defendants for $50,000 plus interest.
The claim is based on the allegation that the plaintiff loaned the defendant Kelly $69,000.
The plaintiff claims the defendants agreed to repay the loan in the amount of $1,500 per month.
HELD: The plaintiff's claim is dismissed.
The only evidence that might suggest that this transaction was a loan to either of the defendants was that some of the payments made by the defendant to the plaintiff were in the amount of $1,500, the amount that the plaintiff asserts was the monthly amount to be repaid by the defendant for the loan.
However, there was no evidence as to when the agreement to pay $1,500 was made.
In her testimony, the plaintiff stated that when the decision was made to pay the $69,000 to the business, she did not have a discussion with the defendant, Kelly.

It took the position the disc herniation was not caused by the accident.
Pursuant to s. 194(1) of the Act, Peters applied to the respondent for a review of its decision.
[3] The issue before me is whether Peters’ disc herniation was caused by the accident of February 26, 1995.","The accused successfully challenged the sufficiency of the grounds to issue a search warrant that was used to search her residence.
Although the Information to Obtain was based on information from an anonymous, unproven source, the source's information was corroborated by independent information as to the accused's employment and residence.
The only corroboration of the presence of a crime (a suspected marijuana grow operation) was from a FLIR test.
The court found that the evidence did not rise above the level of suspicion, albeit strong suspicion.
Corroboration of the employment and residence of the accused did not provide particular support for the informant's credibility; neither were results of the FLIR test and the presence of covered windows sufficient corroboration.
The Crown appealed.
Appeal allowed; new trial ordered.
Although the trial judge articulated the proper test and began by analyzing whether the warrant could have been issued, the issue was later mistakenly transformed into whether he, himself, would have issued it.
By weighing the probative evidence, the trial judge effectively substituted his views for those of the issuing justice and wrongly required the issuing justice to draw proper inferences as opposed to reasonable inferences.","[0, 1, 2, 4, 5, 7, 6, 8, 10, 9, 13, 11, 3]"

November 20, 2003 [1] By notice of motion of January 23, 2003, William Waynert, one of 29 nieces and nephews of Charles Carlson, has sought proof of the will of Charles Carlson in solemn form, questioning testamentary capacity, due execution of the will and raising the spectre of undue influence and coercion.
[2] Mr. Carlson died October 13, 2001, and his will dated November 11, 2000, was admitted to probate January 28, 2002.
By his will he bequeathed to four of his nieces his entire estate of approximately $291,000.00.
He was 88 at the time of his death.
When he signed his will, after dictating it to one of the executors, he seemed fully conscious of its content.
The will was witnessed by two friends.
Those attacking the will have not come forth with evidence which, if accepted at trial, would tend to negate testamentary capacity.","In the context of a divorce proceeding, the husband filed an interlocutory application for, inter alia, the termination of spousal support, and the sale of the matrimonial home.
The Chambers judge ordered that the matrimonial home be sold and the assets equally divided between the spouses.
The wife appealed.
Appeal allowed; certain provisions of the Order struck or temporarily lifted to permit the parties a reasonable opportunity to make timely alternative arrangements to resolve the matters in issue consensually, short of selling the matrimonial home;
the court's intervention was necessary to prevent a patent injustice.
There was no mention of any division of matrimonial assets in the notice filed by the husband and in the unique circumstances of this case, it was unrealistic and unfair to address the issue of selling the house without at the same time taking into account its value and the parties' individual contributions to that value.","[0, 1, 3, 4, 6, 7, 5, 8, 9, 10, 2, 12]"

TRUSTEEJodi Vaughn, for Doris Kolody Fred Zinkhan, for S.E.D.C.O.
FIAT MAURICE J. HERAUF, November 13, 1996 Registrar in Bankruptcy In a written decision dated September 11, 1996, Madam Justice Gunn awarded costs of the application to Doris Kolody.
In addition, Mrs. Kolody was awarded taxable costs of the abortive examination of July 22, 1996.
Prior to the taxation proceeding, a preliminary issue was raised by counsel for S.E.D.C.O.
concerning the interpretation of Rule 566 (o) of the Queen’s Bench Rules of Court.
Counsel for S.E.D.C.O.
argued that the costs referred to were awarded in interlocutory proceedings and should not be taxed until the final determination of the action or proceeding.
In essence, he contends that the taxation is premature.
The facts are clearly set out in the Judgment of Gunn, J. and need not be repeated here in detail.
The proceeding at issue is a bankruptcy matter.
John Kolody is the bankrupt and also the husband of Doris Kolody.
S.E.D.C.O.
obtained an order pursuant to Section 163 of the Bankruptcy and Insolvency Act to examine Doris Kolody.","The two plaintiffs were injured when the defendant police officer made a left hand turn in front of their motor vehicle at night.
Although the plaintiff driver was proceeding through a green light, the defendant alleged that her vehicle's headlights were not in operation.
The driver suffered soft tissue injuries to her neck and mid and lower back, blunt trauma to both knees and bruising of the right hand.
She underwent physiotherapy for three months and made a complete recovery within two years except for flare-ups in the upper back.
The second plaintiff suffered neck stiffness, bilateral shoulder pain and bruising to his arm and leg.
He underwent successful surgery for tendonitis in both shoulders and his neck improved with physiotherapy.
General damages awarded to the plaintiff driver in the amount of $12,000; general damages awarded to the second plaintiff in the amount of $25,000 (reduced by 25% due to that plaintiff's failure to wear a seat belt).
The court found that even if the second plaintiff's tendonitis was not caused by the accident, it was definitely aggravated by it.
The headlights were in operation on the plaintiff's vehicle at the time of the collision; evidence was not presented which established that the defendant's expert was qualified to express the opinion he gave in his testimony as to the state of the headlights and even if he was qualified to express an opinion on the condition of the lights prior to the accident, his evidence was not probative and lacked consistency; it conflicted with the clear evidence advanced by persons at the scene prior to and at the time of the impact.","[0, 1, 2, 4, 3, 7, 6, 5, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16]"

Young was served with the Notice of Formal Discipline Proceedings in Form A under the Act on October 28, 1998.
A hearing before Dirk Silversides, a hearing officer appointed to hear such matters under the Act with respect to this charge commenced December 10, 1998.

The warrant alleged that the accused, an accountant who ran his business out of his home, filed a fraudulent T4 and created false T4 income in order to obtain a tax refund and misreported HST sales.
Although the correct information was contained in the informant's file, there were two errors made in the Information to Obtain the warrant; the Crown argued that the errors were inadvertent and not intended to deceive the Justice and that the things to be searched for had relevance beyond the discrepancies.
The applicant also argued that the issuing Justice should have recused himself due to being in a conflict of interest situation from having provided independent legal advice to the applicant's wife in respect of a mortgage transaction approximately seven years ago and later being consulted by the wife when the parties were experiencing marital difficulties.
Application to quash the warrant allowed on the basis that there were not reasonable and probable grounds for its issuance;
there was no reasonable apprehension of bias on behalf of the Justice.
The court drew the inference that the informant would not have pursued the warrant without the undisputed and seriously erroneous information and noted that these errors occurred despite the presence of contrary information in the informant's file.
There was no evidence as to what information the wife had imparted to the Justice in their previous encounters; the oath sworn by the Justice and the fact that the last time the Justice represented the wife was approximately five years prior to the issuance of the warrant militated against a reasonable person having an apprehension of bias.","[1, 0, 4, 6, 9, 2, 7, 13, 12, 11, 5, 15, 20, 19, 14, 17]"

March 5, 2002[1] On September 6, 2000, the applicant Credit Union loaned Keldon McMillan the sum of $37,700.00 upon security of (inter alia) a 1999 Chevrolet Blazer.
Mr. McMillan was the owner of the Blazer under a vehicle registration certificate at the time of the loan transaction.
A security agreement was registered at the Personal Property Registry on September 11, 2000.
It lapsed a year later and was re-registered November 14, 2001.
Keldon McMillan died in June of 2001, payments on his loan fell into arrears and a demand was made for possession of the Blazer.
[2] Kimberly Clayton, Mr. McMillan's wife, had apparently been the person who used the Blazer and who had made payments on it under the original purchase agreement.
She was shown as a co-buyer on that purchase agreement but she was never the registered owner of the vehicle until she acquired it from her husband's estate.
[3] Prior to the expiry of the registration the Credit Union had made Ms. Clayton aware of their claim and of their intent to realize upon their security.","Custodial arrangements for the parties two youngest children (aged 15 and 13), who currently lived with the father the majority of the time, were at issue.
The marriage had been traditional, with the wife being the primary caretaker of the children.
Both children were heavily involved in sporting activities and the father felt that since he was retired, he would be better able to ensure their attendance at various games and practices.
The mother, who had recently commenced employment as a social worker, felt that the current interim arrangement was difficult for the children in that they would forget their school books at the other parent's residence and were sometimes left alone for extended periods at the father's residence.
Children placed in the custody and primary care of the mother;
until the separation, the mother had been the primary caretaker of the children and she appeared to have a stronger emotional bond with them; the father had been physically, emotionally and verbally abusive to the wife throughout the marriage and seemed incapable of putting the children's needs above his own; and the mother was much more likely than the father to encourage the children to have contact with the other parent.
Although the father was retired and might have more time to spend with the children, this did not outweigh all of the other factors.","[0, 1, 3, 2, 4, 6, 5, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12]"

[2] The only evidence led in the voir dire at the trial was that of the police officer who had stopped the respondent in a routine traffic stop of vehicles entering Saskatoon from the east.
After the police officer determined that he had reasonable and probable grounds to believe that the respondent was operating his motor vehicle while impaired, he arrested the respondent, read the respondent his right to retain counsel and gave the requisite police warning.

Q Okay.","The Crown has applied pursuant to s. 753 of the Criminal Code to have the accused designated a dangerous offender.
There is no question that the accused was convicted of a 'serious personal injury offence' as that term is defined in s. 752 of the Code.
It is also clear that the accused's predicate offence and past behaviour lead to the conclusion that the requirements set out in s. 753(1) of the Code have been met.
The sole issue left for the Court to determine is whether the evidence permits the Court to find that there is a reasonable possibility of eventual control of the risk the accused poses to the community so that he could be designated a long term offender rather than a dangerous offender.
This is not a case where a definite term of imprisonment would be appropriate, as was conceded by defence counsel.
HELD: The accused is a dangerous offender.
He is sentenced to indeterminate detention.
1) The accused does not have significant gaps in his violent offending, except for one period of about 19 months beginning August 2000.
While there is a significant time period between his offences concerning T.R. (1993) and those involving P.M. (2003) there are also the other violent offences concerning women which are of concern, both with respect to MZ, which is a third example of that type of controlling, violent behaviour and the incidents concerning F.B. and S.O. which denote more explosive violent behaviour.
2) The expert evidence supports a finding that the accused is not someone who can be treated so as to reduce the risk of re-offence he presents to the community to an acceptable level.
 3) Although many of the accused's offences were committed while he was under the influence of drugs or alcohol, it is doubtful that the continuous beatings which he inflicted on his domestic partners can all be attributed to violence while under the influence of substances.
4) The accused does not pose a risk to just a single person.
Any woman he has contact with either through family relationships, intimate relationships, or purely social relationships is at risk of his penchant to punch or kick them in the face.
Those he is involved with in a domestic situation or intimate relationship are at grave risk of his controlling, violent and torture-like abusing behaviour over a lengthy period of time.
It is unlikely that restrictions in his living arrangements would be effective in preventing him from being intimately involved with women, who would be at risk.
5) The Court was of the opinion that the accused has significant psychopathic features of his personality that are so entrenched as to be impervious to change such that the sentencing principle of public protection can only be achieved by an indeterminate sentence.","[2, 8, 7, 9, 5, 4, 3, 11, 6, 10, 12, 13, 15, 1, 14]"

[1] Chisum Log Homes and Lumber Ltd. manufactures log-home packages near Weyakwin, Saskatchewan, under the direction of Garry Varga, the sole director of the company.
As a result of what the manufacture of these packages entails, both the company and Mr. Varga were convicted in Provincial Court of operating a forest products processing facility without a licence, contrary to s.18.1 of The Forest Resources Management Act, S.S. 1996, c. F-19.1.
In consequence, each was fined and ordered to pay a surcharge.

In this application each of her father, mother and maternal grandmother compete for some form of custody over her.
The father seeks sole custody.
The mother and grandmother seek joint custody with the father.
The mother seeks to be designated as her daughter's primary caregiver.
HELD: 1) The father and his wife Patricia have been the primary caregivers and psychological parents of Hayley for in excess of 2 years.
The preservation of that important relationship when added to all other factors in this case tips the scales in favour of the father.
2) The family which has been Hayley's experience for the past 2 years, even if relocated to Calgary, is where the continuity, consistency and stability necessary to attain Hayley's best interests will be found.
3) The father must be the sole custodian of Hayley.
He must consult with her mother.
The evidence shows that the parties have not been able to maintain a functional parental relationship.
Whether the mother establishes a new residence in Moose Jaw or Cold Lake, the distance relative to Calgary is significant. 4)
A grandparent may be a person of sufficient interest if the relationship leads to the conclusion that such a relationship is beneficial to the child and consequently harmful if terminated.
That is the first step.
The second step arises only where the grandparent is found to be a person of sufficient interest.
It proceeds with a review based on the best interest principle as enunciated by s. 9(1) of the Act.
5) The court was satisfied that the grandmother is a person of sufficient interest in Hayley's life and that if her relationship as grandmother to Hayley was thwarted by the actions of Hayley's parents, the result to Hayley would be harmful.
There are situations, and this is one of them, where the court should curtail the tradition of access to a grandchild flowing from the parents who have the right to control the upbringing of their child and to determine what relationships the child shall be a party to.
An independent right of access is needed to attain Hayley's best interests.
The history and intensity of Hayley's relationship with her maternal grandmother weighs in favour of specifying access.","[1, 2, 6, 5, 4, 3, 7, 0, 9]"

Introduction [1] Albert Trevor Peters (the “offender”) pled guilty to committing an aggravated assault on his common‑law partner contrary to s. 268 of the Criminal Code.
The Crown has applied under Part XXIV of the Criminal Code to have him declared a dangerous offender.
The offender is a 52‑year‑old man with a significant criminal record.
The Crown contends that the offender fits the criteria for dangerous offenders and should be declared to be one and sentenced to an indeterminate sentence.
[2] The offender, on the other hand, argues that he fits neither within the dangerous offender nor the long‑term offender category but should merely be sentenced to a standard determinate sentence for the crime that he has committed.
[3] There is no doubt that the offender meets the dangerous offender criteria set forth in the relevant Criminal Code provisions in force at the time.
The real issue is whether there is a reasonable possibility that the offender can eventually be controlled in the community so as to justify the imposition of a long‑term offender designation rather than the more serious dangerous offender designation.
If found to be a long‑term offender, it is then necessary to impose an appropriate determinate sentence to go along with the long‑term supervision order.
Preliminary Matters A.
Timing [5] The application was made following the conviction of the offender and prior to him being sentenced.","FIAT: The plaintiffs apply for an order requiring the defendant doctor to answer the interrogatories and attend a further examination for discovery.
The defendants seek an order striking portions of the statement of claim, and requiring the plaintiff to provide answers to undertakings given at his examination for discovery.
HELD: 1) Rule 222 of The Queen's Bench Rules allows a party to a proceeding without order to examine for discovery, before trial, an adverse party touching matters at issue.
If the plaintiffs are in effect seeking to obtain particulars of similar fact circumstances, the prejudicial effect of such evidence far outweighs any prohibitive value.
At the same time, s. 60(2) of The Medical Profession Act, 1981 protects against disclosure of information or evidence given during proceedings conducted by the College of Physicians and Surgeons.
Likewise, s. 35.1 of The Saskatchewan Medical Evidence Act grants a similar privilege relating to quality assurance committees that have evaluated care given to patients in hospitals.
Insofar as the interrogatories relate to patients, surgical procedures or proceedings not related to the subject litigation, they are either not relevant or privileged.
Since the statement of claim has twice been amended, the court was satisfied that special circumstances exist permitting further examination for discovery and/or interrogatories.
Wide latitude is permitted at this stage of the proceedings.
The trial judge will be in the best position to determine the admissibility of information obtained in relation to the doctor's skills, techniques, judgment and competency.
The plaintiffs are entitled to responses to specific interrogatories.
If further elaboration is required, the plaintiffs may at their own expense re-examine the doctor.
Such examination should not include inquiries as to other patient names, hospitals involved or details of the surgical procedures or surgeries performed.
 2) Pursuant to Rule 173(a) of the Rules of Court it must be plain and obvious that the paragraphs of the statement of claim disclose no reasonable cause of action.
Punitive damages are awarded in situations where the defendant's misconduct is so malicious, oppressive and high-handed that it offends the court's sense of decency.
Such damages are only awarded where the combined award of general and aggravated damages are insufficient to achieve punishment and deterrence.
The defendant's misconduct does not have to be an independent actionable wrong to attract punitive damages.
The breach of a duty that is owed will attract an award of punitive damages.
It is not the degree of negligence but the mental element that accompanies the negligence that give rise to a claim for aggravated or punitive damages.
The amended statement of claim alleges the doctor failed to inform one of the plaintiff of the risks associated with the surgery leading her to believe there were no risks involved.
Such negligence, if proven, could lead a trier of fact to conclude that both aggravated and punitive damages are warranted against this doctor.
It would be somewhat presumptuous at this stage to conclude that it is plain and obvious that the plaintiffs do not have a cause of action for aggravated or punitive damages against the doctor.
In the courts view humiliation, indignity, degradation or shame could be the consequences of the wrongful behaviour pleaded.
If those emotions must be specifically pleaded, the plaintiffs can apply for a further amendment of their claim. 3)
The obligations of a party to comply with undertakings given at an examination for discovery are contained in Rule 231 of The Queen's Bench Rules.
To the extent that the doctor has been required to respond to interrogatories relating to his skill and training and to the extent that any further cross-examination may show defects in his competency, the plaintiff's undertaking must be answered.
If the plaintiffs have further or other facts, those facts must be provided.
4) The defendants are not entitled to know or to take advantage of or receive any credit for or accounting relating to trust funds gratuitously set up for the plaintiff.
However, an accounting regarding the bank records and the records produced for the Public Trustee by the Trustee for the trust fund will be complied with as it may impact on the claim by him for loss of income as a result of being required to be in attendance to provide care for the plaintiff.","[9, 6, 16, 3, 8, 7, 4, 11, 1, 5, 13, 10]"

303 at 307;[2] To begin with, we can find no material error in Madam Justice Hunter's analysis of the majority's approach to the interpretation of the provisions in question.
The resulting interpretation was not necessarily unreasonable, though this points in that direction, and we do not take Madam Justice Hunter to have thought otherwise, for her analysis extends beyond the majority's approach to the interpretation of the provisions.
[3] Nor can we find any material error in the remainder of her analysis, including that concerned with the phrase ""pursuant to Article 28 ... or 26 ... as the case may be,"" appearing in Article 16.
[4] Finally, we can find no error in Madam Justice Hunter's identification or application of the governing standard of review.
In the circumstances we think it was open to her to come to that conclusion, and so we would dismiss the appeal.","The defendant was charged with impaired driving and operating a motor vehicle with a blood alcohol content over the legal limit.
The police first noticed the accused when he got out of his vehicle (which was parked near a pub), staggered slightly and then got back in.
The defendant's evidence was that he had only entered his vehicle to listen to music while he decided whether to walk to a nearby party or his girlfriend's house.
Defendant found not guilty of either offence charged.
From the defendant's whole course of conduct, which included driving the vehicle to the pub before consuming any alcohol, walking to his friend's house and back again to the pub, as well as his stated intention to leave the vehicle where it was, the court concluded that he had rebutted the presumption under s. 258(1(a).
Given that the defendant's vehicle was parked on a level parking lot with its nose two feet or less from a building, the parking brake was engaged, the vehicle was in first gear and the engine was not running, the court concluded that there was little, if any, danger of the vehicle being set in motion unintentionally or of it becoming a danger to the public.","[0, 1, 4, 3, 5, 6, 12, 7, 15, 10, 17, 14, 20, 8]"

The work performed by the defendants was done in conjunction with that assessment.
[5] The plaintiffs conducted examinations for discovery of the defendants on June 16, 17 and 18, 1999.

MR. PARTHEV: Again, that's not a fair question to put to this witness.","The accused is charged with assault contrary to s. 266 of the Criminal Code.
The Crown applies to admit into evidence oral statements made by the complainant to her neighbor and to the police for consideration of the truth of their contents.
HELD: The statements made by the complainant are found to be reliable and are therefore admissible.
 1) Hearsay statement may be admitted on a principled basis, the governing principles are reliability and necessity.
A number of cases have held that necessity is met when a witness recants or in some other fashion effectively holds hostage evidence that cannot be obtained from another source.
2) There is no other way to obtain the complainant's evidence.
Whether her alcohol consumption that night erased her recollection of events or whether she is a hostile witness is immaterial at this stage.
Either way she effectively holds hostage that evidence and the court need not determine the reason for the purpose of this application.
The test of necessity has been met.
 3) With regard to reliability, the question becomes whether there are sufficient indicia of reliability in a particular case to substitute the lack of oath, lack of cross-examination and absence of video taping.
Where the hearsay statement was made in circumstances which provide some guarantees of trustworthiness, the test for reliability will be met.
The following circumstances are evidence of trustworthiness: the complainant arrived unexpectedly at her neighbor's apartment, she was upset and crying, she asked that police be called, she spontaneously described the assault, she repeated a consistent version to the police, she had fresh red marks which corresponded with her description of the assault and the accused verified aspects of her complaint with comments he made.","[1, 0, 8, 9, 20, 3, 17, 24, 25, 22, 11, 10, 23, 19, 6]"

HELD: 1)
The father is not opposed to Kody receiving some additional educational assistance.
However, he believes that the Sylvan Learning Center is too expensive.
The father did not present any evidence with regard to other possible educational programs for the summer.
It is clear that he has not researched alternatives to the Sylvan program.
On the evidence, the expense is necessary for Kody.
The real issue is whether the father has the means to contribute given his child support payments.
If the father pays $472 per month for the Sylvan program, in addition to his s. 3 child support payments, the father's total child support payable would be $1,315 per month.
The father would have a net monthly cash flow in the sum of $1,066 while the mother with four children would have available cash flow in the sum of $2,700 per month.

86/2006 Judicial Centre: Swift CurrentBETWEEN:ALICE REGINA LATURNUS PETITIONER - and -DALE ANTON LATURNUSRESPONDENTCounsel: Karl P. Bazin, Q.C.
The divorce was granted on July 26, 2006.
The remaining matters proceeded to trial on December 5, 2006.
However, by the end of that day a settlement was achieved with respect to all matters but one.
Judgments were entered accordingly.
[2] The outstanding matter was that of child support, past and future.
Agreement could not be reached and that dispute later proceeded to trial over two days.
The dispute largely centered on what monies were owed from the past.
Central to this was the determination of the respondent’s income.
When the parties separated in 2003 the children resided with their respective parents on alternate weeks.
This came to an end on August 1, 2004, when the petitioner moved to Medicine Hat, Alberta.
The three girls moved with her.
In July, 2005, Stacey and Mandey returned to the respondent.
That arrangement has continued to the present.
[4] There were interlocutory applications in the past, the most significant of which resulted in an order dated June 29, 2004.","This is an application by the accused for an order that evidence obtained by way of a telephone interception be ruled inadmissible because it is irrelevant.
Alternatively, the accused seeks exclusion of the intercepted communication on the basis that it was conducted in violation of s. 8 of the Charter and ought to be excluded under s. 24(2).
The accused is charged with abuse of a position of trust contrary to s. 153(1)(a) of the Code.
HELD: The evidence is admissible.
The accused's application is dismissed.
1) After examining the transcript of the conversation, it is immediately evident that the contents of the communication are relevant.
The complainant and the accused are discussing the intimate details of their relationship.
The conversation is logically probative to the charge.
2) The learned provincial court judge did in fact have sufficient evidence before him to issue the telephone intercept authorization.
The complainant was prepared to initiate a telephone call to the accused and engage him in a conversation which would likely cause the accused to make admissions or statements which could be confirmatory of her allegations.
3) The authorization clearly permits the police to intercept private communications in relation to an offence under s. 271(1) of the Code.
That investigation was live and bona fide at the time that the authorization was obtained.
The law in this country is that evidence of other crimes revealed during the course of a lawful intercept process does not render the evidence obtained inadmissible in relation to an offence not named in the authorization.
The focus is on whether the interception was lawfully obtained and executed, not on what is discovered.
Here the police obtained a valid authorization to intercept private communications in relation to an offence under s. 271(1) of the Code.
During the investigation of that charge, they obtained evidence which is relevant to an offence under s. 153(1)(a) of the Code.
The fact that the offence of s. 153(1)(a) is not named in the authorization nor included as an offence for which an authorization to intercept private communications could be obtained, does not affect the admissibility of the evidence.
Therefore, there is no Charter breach.
4) Even if the evidence was obtained in violation of s. 8 of the Charter, such evidence is considered non-conscriptive evidence.
Where the evidence is non-conscriptive, the court ought to go on to do a balancing as to whether or not the evidence ought to be excluded pursuant to s. 24(2) of the Charter.
The factors to be considered are trial fairness, seriousness of the breach and the effect of exclusion.
In this case if there is a breach, it was not serious and was inadvertent, the result of unmindful draftsmanship.
There is no evidence of bad faith.
There is no evidence of manipulation.
The seriousness of the breach, if there was one, was minimal, and to admit the evidence would not bring the administration of justice into disrepute.","[6, 4, 10, 7, 5, 3, 0, 9, 8, 1, 15, 17, 12, 13, 14, 19]"

Settlement negotiations are protected by settlement privilege which is a jointly held privilege that cannot be waived by any one party acting alone.
This privilege is fundamental to the policy interest of promoting settlement discussions as a means to avoiding trial.
It should only be set aside if there is a very compelling, competing policy warranting such.
As settlement communications are almost always irrelevant to the issues that are properly considered by the Court, it is rare that there will be any competing policy or, indeed, any reason to reference them at all.
2) The application at bar is another salvo in a bitter custody and access dispute.
I ruled on the substantive aspect of the application in a separate fiat and now render my decision in respect of the admissibility of some of the evidence the respondent put before the Court.
He exhibited a letter to his affidavit that was from his counsel to the petitioner’s counsel.
3) Just as promised, the letter goes on to set out a detailed, comprehensive offer of settlement.
Although the law is clear that settlement proposals should seldom be made known to the Court, it happens too often and for no good reason.","FIAT: The plaintiffs are former students of a school at Ile a La Crosse, Saskatchewan.
They commenced this proposed class action against the Attorney General of Canada (the Government) in December 2005.
In January 2007 the plaintiffs' counsel filed an amended statement of claim which added the Government of Saskatchewan (Saskatchewan) as a second defendant.
Saskatchewan applies for an order pursuant to Rule 166 and 168 of the Queen's Bench Rules disallowing the amendments to the statement of claim.
The amended claim alleges that the Government and Saskatchewan funded and were responsible for the school in a supervisory and oversight capacity and that they are liable to the plaintiffs for physical and sexual abuse, loss of language and culture, failing to provide an adequate education and holding them against their will and the will of their parents.
HELD: 1) This application is based on the proposition that s. 20 of The Limitations Act applies to the plaintiffs' amended claim.
However, s. 20 does not apply because no limitation period expired after the original claim was commenced and before the claim was amended to add Saskatchewan as a defendant.
Section 19 of The Limitations Act applies to the original and the amended claims.
The application is dismissed.
2) Accepting the pleadings as true, a number of the plaintiffs' claims are prima facie statute-barred.
The plaintiff may choose to apply for orders determining that no time limitation period applies or allowing the claims to be brought.
Alternatively, the defendants may apply for orders determining that some or all of the claims are statute-barred.

That rule provides as follows: 278A At the close of the plaintiff’s case the defendant may, without being called upon to elect whether he will call evidence, move for dismissal of the action.
BACKGROUND CIRCUMSTANCES[2] This case involves a professional negligence claim being advanced by the plaintiff against her former solicitors, Michael Tochor and E. F. Anthony (Tony) Merchant (as well as a related corporate defendant).
The Information was sworn and dated June 1, 1995.
The defendant, Michael Tochor primarily undertook her defence.
[4] After this verdict the plaintiff discharged her solicitors and thereafter, as a self-represented appellant, appealed the Provincial Court judgment to the Court of Queen’s Bench, the Court of Appeal and ultimately she sought leave to appeal to the Supreme Court of Canada, all appeals and applications being dismissed.
She then commenced this action against her solicitors for negligence.
This trial began April 21, 2003.
[5] The plaintiff’s Statement of Claim alleges various particulars of negligence and unprofessional conduct against the defendant lawyers.
It claims that as a result of these actions the plaintiff “was convicted improperly” (paragraph 4 of the Statement of Claim).","The appellant appealed the adoption order regarding her natural child.
Although at one time the child had been in the permanent care of the Agency, that order was terminated and replaced by a private guardianship order which had placed the child with the now-adoptive parents.
Although neither of the birth parents, who resided in British Columbia, had attended the adoption hearing, the birth mother now sought access to the child and requested that the court receive fresh evidence as to her unsuccessful efforts to obtain counsel to represent her at the adoption hearing.
Appeal allowed; adoption order set aside; matter remitted to the application court for a further hearing; application to admit fresh evidence granted in part; the portions of the appellant's affidavit addressing her efforts to secure counsel for the adoption hearing admitted into evidence.
The appellant had a bona fide intention to appear or to be represented at the hearing and had made reasonable, although unsuccessful, efforts to do so.
Allowing the appeal would be in the child's best interests as she had resided with the adoptive parents for the past three years and would continue to do so pending the further hearing.","[4, 5, 0, 8, 15, 1, 2, 16, 7, 12, 14, 11]"

Sydney Lovell is the principal officer of Fossil.
Indeed, it is his company.
He incorporated it for the purpose of becoming involved with Tudex.
Andrew Crooks, Lionel Conn and Bill Molle were at the material time the three principal officers of Tudex.

Molle was until June, 1982, the chief financial officer of Tudex.

The Facts[2] The majority of the facts are not in serious dispute.
The Plaintiff operates the Whitewood Inn in Whitewood, Saskatchewan and in September of 2007, entered into an agreement with the Defendant to supply and install business equipment at the Inn.
[3] The equipment consisted of two groups of computerized business equipment which can be loosely categorized as the “Cash Equipment” and the “Camera Equipment”.
[4] Rod Kletcho was at all times the operating mind of the Defendant and he entered into an agreement with the Plaintiff to supply and install a number of pieces of equipment which were to be compatible with each other.
No service contract was ever signed between the Plaintiff and the Defendant.
[5] Contemporaneously with this agreement, the Plaintiff entered into a financing agreement with Irwin Financial Canada Corporation dated October 31, 2007.
[6] The equipment was subsequently installed by employees of the Defendant in September and October of 2007.","The Minister of Social Services applied for leave to appeal an order of Gabrielson J., sitting on appeal from an order of Meekma P.C.J. in relation to the child K.W.

The report was very favourable to R.S. The parties agreed to Gabrielson J. receiving the report and neither party sought to cross-examine the writer of the report.
HELD: Leave denied.
Even if there was a scintilla of merit to the argument, the Court would not grant leave to appeal on the basis that to grant leave to appeal on an extremely technical ground would cause delay that is manifestly not in the best interest of the child in the circumstances of this case.

[3] On March 22, 2010, the affidavit of Navdeep Sra dated March 19, 2010, was filed on behalf of Alberta Ltd. asserting, inter alia:3.","The tenant's year-to-year lease ran from September 1 to August 31.
Four months before it was set to automatically renew, he notified the landlord he wished to convert to a month-to-month tenancy.
The landlord refused, saying vacancies were hard to fill at any time other than September 1st.
The three bedroom rental was in an area with a large university student population and was targeted at individuals sharing not families.
It was a high-end rental, and would not necessarily appeal to students.
The landlord provided evidence that the last time it was on the market in winter, it was vacant for several months.
After a Residential Tenancies Board hearing, an officer declared the tenant successful.
The written decision did not mention the landlord's reasons for refusing consent, nor did it say they were arbitrary or unreasonable.
The landlord appealed, but offered to compromise by allowing the tenant to terminate the lease any time between May 31 and August 31 without penalty.
The officer erred in law.
The Act allows the landlord some discretion to refuse a request to convert to month-to-month, providing the refusal is made reasonably.
The landlord's reasons were neither unreasonable nor arbitrary, given the reality of the market and his past experiences with a winter vacancy.
There may be other situations where consent could reasonably be withheld.
The tenancy is declared to have been renewed for another year (with the understanding the landlord will allow the tenant to terminate at any point after May 31).
Both parties acted in good faith and, while it might seem unfair to lock the tenant into a lease he believed had converted to month-to-month, the court must make the order the officer should have made in the first place.","[2, 0, 1, 5, 3, 6, 7, 8, 12, 4, 9, 15, 11, 16]"

Mills, Q.C.
for the defendants JUDGMENT KONKIN J. October 25, 2005 [1] In this action, which is under the simplified procedure rules, the plaintiff seeks damages in the amount of $50,000 plus interest in accordance with the provisions of The Pre-judgment Interest Act, S.S. 1984-85-86, c. P-22.2.
The claim is based on the allegation by the plaintiff that she loaned some $69,000 to the defendant Kelly Eiswerth on or about the 30th day of January 2001.
The claim goes on to say that the defendants agreed to repay the loan in the amount of $1,500 per month, that some payments were made, but in the end, an amount of approximately $61,000 was still outstanding.
The defendants deny that this transaction was a loan to the individual Kelly Eiswerth, and argue that in fact it was an investment by the plaintiff and her then husband Ken Eiswerth into the auto brokering business known as E & M Auto Brokers 1999 (“E & M”), which was a registered business name of the defendant company 627089 Saskatchewan Ltd.[2] A summary trial was ordered in this issue on May 3, 2005.
ISSUES[3] The two issues in this case are as follows:1.","The Ministry of Social Services seeks a 6 month order pursuant to s. 37(c) of The Child and Family Services Act with respect to the two children, NS is four years old and DS is two years old.
DS was apprehended by the Ministry when he was born.
Both NS and DS were the subject of a consent order for 6 months in October 2007.
Both children have been in care for most of their lives.
The Ministry requests a six month order with a proviso that it be for the purposes of allowing the Ministry to make long term placement plans for both children.
The mother HH is not seeking a return of the children to her but supports the position of NOS, the father, who ask that the children be returned to him in his care.
HELD: 1) If the children are returned to NOS, they will not receive a level of parenting that is above the minimal standard that will be tolerated by our society.
Both children have some difficulties which must be managed carefully to ensure their continued growth and improvement.
2) Given the difficulties the parents struggle with, they can not provide that management.
The Ministry has tendered substantial evidence of criminal activity on the part of NOS and police involvement in the life of HH.
The criminal behaviour of NOS in and of itself would not disqualify him from parenting the children if the children were not exposed to that behaviour.
There is a risk that the children may be exposed to such behaviour in the future.
There is no evidence that NOS has done so in the past.
The evidence of domestic violence is equivocal.
There is evidence of consistent fighting and disruption of their relationship in the past.
The Court finds that the relationship is unstable.
The parents' addictions continue to loom large in their lives and relationship.
The Court is not convinced that the father's addiction has been stabilized and is fully under control.
There have been slip-ups and missed appointments at the methadone clinic.
This should not be visited on the children.
HH is even less advanced in dealing with her addictions than NOS.
The evidence indicates good intentions but not the personal strength to take and complete programming whether offered by the methadone client, or ordered as a condition of the court.
This is troubling because if the parents don't have the strength to achieve this, there is a question as to whether they have the personal strength to provide the minimal care for these children required by law on a day to day basis. 3)
If the children are returned to NOS, they are likely to suffer physical and emotional harm.
While the parents have had successful visits with the children while in care and had a period of some months where the children were apparently looked after by them, this does not convince the Court that they belong with NOS.
The day to day stress of parenting is substantially different than visits of several hours.
The evidence does not convince the Court that the children would receive consistent care month after month despite one past success in doing so.
The children are in need of protection and should not be returned to NOS or HH.
4) Although the Ministry seeks a 6 month order with the notation that it is for the purposes of permanency planning, the Court is not inclined to make such an order.
A 6 month order is premised on a reasonable prospect of change by the parents within a reasonable time.
The parents have this opportunity to demonstrate that they are serious about changing their lives so that their children can be returned to them.","[0, 1, 5, 6, 3, 8, 4, 7]"
895,"Before the work was completed, the Evins terminated their contract with Mr.
Harder believing Mr. Harder’s workmanship was poor, that he had caused some damage to their home and created a mess.
The Evins hired another contractor to redo some of the work, repair the damage and finish the job.
They claim their damages to be $5,975.95, but acknowledge they owe Mr.
Harder for the removal of a bedroom wall.
[2] Mr.
Harder, a general contractor, denies his workmanship was poor.
He states he performed a portion of the work, but was not allowed to finish the job or clean up.
Further, his tools remained at the plaintiffs’ home for several months after he was terminated.
Background [3] In March 2011, the plaintiffs engaged the services of the defendant to perform work for them.
After the work had begun, the plaintiff Beverly Evin asked Mr.
Harder to perform additional work.
[5] The plaintiffs identified a number of deficiencies and provided photographs at trial illustrating many of their concerns.
Generally, those concerns are as follows:1.
The drywall installed in the bedroom and living room was the incorrect width and therefore did not fit flush with the existing walls;2.
[6] The plaintiffs began raising their concerns with the defendant as early as his second day of work.","Counsel for the plaintiffs brings two notices of motion seeking 1) the opportunity to cross-examine a deponent on her affidavit and 2) an order to compel one of defendants to supply pre-certification notices to all persons who may be eligible to participate in the class action that is contemplated.
HELD: The motions are dismissed with no order as to costs.
 1) One of defendants contends that 7 people alleged by the plaintiffs to be viable class members have already entered into a full and final settlement with the defendant.
This defendant earlier sought to examine these individuals.
The Justice of this action at that time did not allow the examination but instead made an order permitting the defendant to file affidavits on the issue.
This is the source of the affidavit the plaintiff seeks cross-examination on.
The order also allowed the plaintiffs to file reply affidavits, which they chose not to do.
There is nothing in the original order that could be interpreted as saying that the plaintiffs could cross-examine on the affidavit.
In the view of the Court, having chosen not to file reply affidavits pursuant to the original order, it is not reasonable for plaintiff's counsel to embark on a totally different approach several weeks after the deadline has passed.
There is also some concern that the actual purpose of the proposed cross-examination would be more general and broad-ranging than a mere challenge to the defendant's assertion that the individuals at issue have already entered into full and final settlements with the defendant.
 2) In its barest sense, plaintiffs' counsel requests that the defendant supply a plaintiff by way of sending pre-certification notices to its clients.
The Court is aware of Lewis v. Shell, where an Ontario court ordered notice to potential class members.
However, that case is not similar to this case.
In the Lewis case, the Court was faced with concern over the defendant contacting individuals who might be potential class members for the purpose of obtaining early settlements.
Moreover, the Ontario class actions legislation is less restrictive than Saskatchewan's.

RespondentCoram: Gerwing, Lane & Richards JJ.A.
Counsel: A.B.Gerein for the Appellant Marvin Bloos, Q.C.
His case went to the Youth Justice Court (“Youth Court”) for review under s. 103 of the YCJA.
[2] The Youth Court judge interpreted the YCJA as meaning the respondent’s sentence had continued to run while he was at large and, as a result, had already expired.
In consequence, she held that no action was required on the alleged breach of the custody and supervision order.
[4] I accept the Crown’s argument and find, for the reasons which follow, that the Youth Court judge erred in her interpretation of the YCJA.
I.
Factual Background[5] In May of 2004 the respondent was sentenced to six months deferred custody and supervision, followed by six months of probation, for a variety of matters including break and enters, theft, a weapons offence and a drug offence.
[6] The respondent was released from custody on October 8, 2004 and began the community supervision portion of his sentence.
Immediately after acknowledging these conditions, the respondent walked away from Quint Youth Lodge and did not return.
[7] The provincial director issued a warrant for the respondent’s arrest on October 8, 2004.
[10] Custody and conditional supervision orders can be made pursuant to either ss.","At issue is the amount of Income Replacement Benefits (IRB) payable to the appellant by SGI.
The parties agree that the calculation of the IRB as provided by s. 117 of the Act is the annualized sum of $28,889.75.
The appellant takes issue with SGI's reduction of the amount determined in accordance with s. 117 of the Act by calculating the appellant's net income in accordance with s. 135 to s. 138 of the Act.
HELD: SGI has correctly calculated the appellant's IRB when it made the requisite deductions as set out in s. 137 to find the appellant's net income, and then reduced the net income to 90% to determine his IRB.
It would be neither a rational nor fair interpretation to reduce a full-time earner's IRB by 90% and not the other types of earners.
It would be neither a rational nor fair interpretation to deduct income tax, employment insurance premiums and Canada Pension contributions from only full-time earners.
All earners are subject to these payments being deducted from their income but for their inability to earn an income because of an automobile accident.
The further deductions to obtain the non- earner's IRB are in keeping with his earning reality.","[1, 2, 10, 8, 7, 11, 0, 14, 6, 16, 25, 17, 12]"

[1] The Superintendent of Pensions seeks leave to appeal an order staying six separate proceedings brought by him in purported exercise of powers conferred on him by s. 8 of The Pension Benefits Act, 1992, S.S. 1992, c.P-6.001 and Regulations made thereunder.
The stay was granted upon the applications of the respondent corporations and was to remain in effect until an action against them by one Faye McMaster, not a party to these proceedings, was settled or otherwise completed.
The subject matter of the McMaster action and the Superintendent’s applications was the same, namely certain monies McMaster’s husband had paid into a pension plan and in which she had an interest by reason of a judicial division of matrimonial property.","The appellant contests an order for $600.00 monthly spousal support given by a Chambers judge on an application to review a previous order which granted the respondent $300.00 monthly spousal support for a period of 1 year.
The parties were married for 24 years following a 2-year period of cohabitation.
They have 2 adult children, one of which is largely supported by the appellant.
Both parties have some health problems.
Originally, the appellant was ordered to pay the respondent $300.00 in monthly spousal support for a period of 1 year.
Given the appellant's health difficulties and the fact that he was nearing retirement, the trial judge noted that the respondent would do well to become self-sufficient as soon as possible.
The Chambers judge who reviewed the original order found that, during the year period the respondent was collecting spousal support, she had not engaged in any gainful employment.
She had sold her house and used the proceeds to spend over 4 months living in Hawaii and Jamaica.
She obtained probationary employment just after filing a notice of motion but lost the job before the hearing commenced.
HELD: The appeal is allowed, the orders of the Chambers judge for spousal support and costs against the appellant are set aside.
The Chambers judge imputed an income of $14,289 to the respondent on the basis that she was capable of working 30 hours per week at minimum wage.
He did not indicate why he did not find her capable of full time employment.
The Chambers judge made an error in calculating the income of the appellant.
He also discounted the expenses borne by the appellant in relation the maintenance of their adult child, who was a full-time student.
It was incumbent on the respondent to establish that she was unable to become self-sufficient.
The evidence did not begin to establish that and, in fact, clearly showed that she made little effort to do so within the year allocated by the trial judge.","[1, 2, 0, 4, 3, 5]"

The petitioner father sought variation of a consent order.
The consent order provided that the parties would have joint custody of the children with the primary residence with the respondent.
The order also provided that the respondent would have the final decision with respect to health and education matters, after consultation with the petitioner.
The situation had evolved to the point that the petitioner had relocated to the same city as the respondent and children.
For the past two and a half year, the petitioner had access to the children 50% of the time.
The petitioner acknowledged that under the current arrangement, the respondent consulted him before making decisions regarding the welfare of the children.
The consent order dealt with child support payable, provided that tax returns be exchanged annually and set out how child support should be calculated on an ongoing basis.
The petitioner sought to have the child support arrangement varied so that his support obligation would not increase or decrease in the years to come.
The petitioner cited increased personal costs to exercise access to the children.
HELD: The petitioner had not established a material change in circumstances sufficient to justify a change to the parenting arrangement.
The original consent order provides that the respondent must consult with the petitioner on issues of health and education and the current arrangement has worked well for the children.
The petitioner also failed to establish a material change in circumstances sufficient to alter the agreed child support arrangement.
The issue of increased costs for the petitioner to exercise access to the children was dealt with in the original consent order.
The only change in circumstances is that the petitioner's income has increased.
The petitioner's application to vary the parenting arrangement and child support order was dismissed.

Owens for Andel GriffithsJUDGMENT KOCH J.November 14, 2003 [1] Andel Griffiths (“Griffiths”) born September 7, 1975 is a Jamaican national living in Saskatoon with his wife Jennifer, a Canadian citizen.
Griffiths entered Canada April 15, 2003 and is entitled to remain in Canada as a permanent resident for the time being.
He has a permanent resident card which expires May 5, 2008.
He has established a residence in Saskatoon.
[2] The United States of America (“USA”) seeks to extradite Griffiths to face a charge of conspiracy to import into the USA a substance containing cocaine.
Griffiths was arrested in Saskatoon on May 28, 2003.
Subsequently the Attorney General of Canada caused to be filed with the court written authority to proceed pursuant to s. 15 of the Extradition Act, 1999, c. 18.
Section 24 of the Act obligates the court to proceed with an extradition hearing.
Pursuant to s. 29, the hearing must necessarily result in either a committal under ss.

Their claim is with respect to a construction residential contract of purchase and sale.
The plaintiffs are claiming the return of their deposit of $25,000.00 and the costs of plans that were prepared for them at a cost of $3,533.25.
The defendant corporation filed a statement of defence on September 17, 2009, denying the claim of the plaintiffs.

The respondents are the child’s adoptive parents and, as well, relatives of the child.

The police vehicle was not equipped with an approved screening device (ASD) and was requested at 3:02 a.m.
Upon receiving the ASD, a demand was made for a breath sample at 3:10 a.m. and a 'fail' reading was obtained at 3:12 a.m.
The accused unsuccessfully attempted to reach three different lawyers at the police station and ultimately spoke with Legal Aid duty counsel.
The accused was charged with driving over .08.
The defence argued that the ASD demand was not made forthwith and the ASD results were unlawfully obtained.
The defence submitted the accused's rights under s. 8, s. 9, and s. 10(b) of the Charter were breached and sought exclusion of the Certificate of Analysis.
HELD: 1) The accused's s. 10(b) Charter right was not infringed.
While the police were obliged to afford the accused a reasonable opportunity to contact counsel and to facilitate that contact, they were not required to monitor the quality of the legal advice once contact was made.
2) Although the accused was arbitrarily detained for a period of 11 minutes from time of detention to making of the ASD demand contrary to s. 8 and s. 9 of the Charter, the officer acted in good faith by placing the accused in the police vehicle because it was cold outside, the accused had no jacket on, he was injured and his vehicle was seriously damaged.

THE APPLICATION: [2] The Applicant is T.K.G., who was one of the Respondents in the original application.
THE FACTS: [3] In her affidavit the Applicant sets out her understanding of what occurred from the date the child was found in need of protective services (protection hearing), to the order of November 12, 2002 (disposition review hearing).
On April 30, 2002, I consented to a finding that C. was in need of protective services pursuant to section 22(2)(b) and (ja) of the Children and Family Services Act.

The accused was spotted at a recycling facility with a sword stuffed in the back of his pants.
At trial, defence called evidence suggesting that a sword of that type could be purchased at a novelty store and had a blunt edge.
The accused testified that he bought the sword with the intention of hanging it on the wall or putting it on his television.
The trial judge found that the Crown had not established that the sword was a weapon or that the accused intended to use it as a weapon.
The Crown appealed on the basis that the trial judge misapprehended evidence, ignored other evidence and improperly admitted opinion evidence.
HELD: The evidence from the defence 'expert' indicated that he had particular experience that allowed him to recognize the sword and he was able to be of assistance to the Court because of his experience.
No attempt was made by the Crown to contradict the evidence that the sword could be purchased at a novelty store and had a blunt edge.
The Crown bore the burden of establishing that the sword was a weapon within s. 2 of the Criminal Code and the only evidence before the Court was that the accused probably bought it as a decorative item and that it likely came from a novelty store.
On that basis, it was open to the trial judge to conclude that she had a reasonable doubt that the sword was designed to be used as a weapon.
The trial judge properly considered the evidence in the context of the issues to be addressed.
The Court held that a sword is not prima facie a weapon.
The Crown appeal was dismissed.","[0, 1, 2, 5, 4, 7, 12, 3, 10, 9]"

The application will be determined in accordance with the 1972 Rules because it was filed before December 31, 2008.
Background[2] The plaintiffs filed an Originating Notice and Statement of Claim on September 21, 2000, in which they claimed that the defendant RBC caused them to suffer losses on investments.

The plaintiffs say RBC is liable for any breach of duty by Mr. O’Neill.
[5] RBC denies responsibility for any loss or damage sustained by the plaintiffs.
It denies the existence of a fiduciary relationship between itself (or Mr. O’Neill) and the plaintiffs.

Both appeals are dismissed as a result of the appellant's failure to perfect, including her failure to file necessary materials or comply with the court's directions to do so.
While a dismissal of the criminal appeal is a serious remedy, since it means it will never be heard on its merits, the appellant has made it clear that she cannot provide certified transcripts unless the court orders the respondents to pay.

He signed a 5-year, 10 mile non-competition clause in 1995.
He quit in early March with the intention of opening a new drug store down the street in early April.
Other key staff members intended to quit and work in the new store.
The applicant moved for an interim injunction to prevent the respondent from opening his store pending the hearing of their motion for an interlocutory injunction.
Interim injunction granted.
The new Civil Procedure Rules (2008) distinguish between interim and interlocutory injunctions.
This is one of the circumstances which was contemplated when the new Rule 41.04 was enacted.
Urgency exists and the applicant can't wait.
While the non-competition clause may well not survive a challenge at the full hearing of the interlocutory injunction motion, all the applicant needs to show is that there is a serious issue to be tried.
There is.
This isn't a frivolous or vexatious application.
There's a high potential for the applicant to suffer irreparable harm (e.g. the loss of customers, market share) especially given that this is a small community.
An interim injunction will only result in a delay of a few weeks.
The interlocutory injunction is set to heard at the end of April.

They have done so after receiving a request from the media to examine that file.
The media request was made according to the provisions of Civil Procedure Rule 59.60.
The relevant provisions of that rule are:(4) A person, other than a party or counsel for a party, who requests access to a court file must give written notice to the parties no less than 20 days before obtaining access.
(5) A party may make a motion for an order sealing all or part of the court file after delivery of written notice of the request for access.

Access can be denied when the ends of justice would be subverted by disclosure or the judicial documents might be used for an improper purpose.

The Crown had proceeded by indictment and the accused was sentenced to four concurrent terms of 8 years and 8 months imprisonment (after 4 months credit for time served on remand) and he received a 10 year firearm prohibition order, a DNA order and a 20-year Sexual Offender Information Registration Act (SOIRA) compliance order.
At issue on appeal was whether the accused should have received a life SOIRA compliance order or a 20-year SOIRA order.
HELD: The appeal was allowed.
The Court of Appeal interpreted s. 490.013(2.1) as meaning that offenders who commit multiple designated offences would be subject to a lifetime SOIRA compliance order.
If Parliament had intended a narrow application of s. 490.013(2.1), it would have used the same language as it did in s. 490.012(3).
Parliament clearly intended s. 490.013(2.1) to apply more broadly to any offender who committed multiple designated offences regardless of whether the sentences for those offences are imposed separately or altogether.","[2, 3, 1, 9, 7, 10, 14, 8, 6, 15]"

The appellant and the respondent separated in 1995.
[2] In January, 1999, the appellant commenced an application under the Matrimonial Property Act, R.S.N.S.
1989, c. 275 (MPA), seeking an equal division of the parties’ assets.
In conjunction with that application, the appellant sought a declaration that the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms is infringed by the definition of “spouse” in s. 2(g) of the MPA.
The relief which the appellant seeks is “an order reading into the definition of spouse s. 2(g) of the MPA, the definition of common law spouse contained in the Family Maintenance Act, R.S.N.S.

[4] Section 15(1) of the Charter provides as follows: 15.
[6] The matter came on for hearing before Justice Haliburton of the Supreme Court on May 14th, 1999.
[7] There was dispute between the appellant and the respondent on certain factual matters set out in their respective affidavits.","The appellant plead guilty to two counts of sexual assault, was declared a dangerous offender and sentenced to an indeterminate sentence.
The appellant appealed the sentence arguing that the sentencing judge failed to give adequate consideration to the assessment of two expert witnesses who testified that they thought the appellant should be found a long-term offender.
HELD: The appeal was dismissed.
The sentencing judge was not bound to accept the assessment of the experts.
Both experts testified that the appellant's risk to reoffend sexually was moderate to high and was extremely high if he did not receive treatment.
Both experts based their opinions, in part, on the idea that the appellant had been a model inmate.
Both experts believed the appellant's self report about his behaviour in custody, despite having reached the conclusion that he was a pathological liar.
Both experts appeared to take the accused at face value when he said he was motivated to change.
In fact, the evidence from correctional officials suggested that the appellant was prone to violent, aggressive and irrational behaviour in custody.
He had shown on numerous occasions that he would not follow the rules in the institution and had been involved in several attempts to smuggle drugs into the jail, including picking up a package in the washroom of the court house during his dangerous offender hearing and convincing his lawyer to bring his baby into the jail with drugs in his diaper.
The accused had committed two sexual assaults within months of being released from a previous sexual assault sentence.
The trial judge was correct to emphasize protection of the public and was entitled to discount the opinion of the experts because it was based on incorrect assumptions.
In supporting the sentencing judge's opinion that the accused would not take treatment because he refused to accept responsibility for his offences, the Court of Appeal noted that the accused had stated in his Notice of Appeal that he was serving a life sentence for two sexual assaults that he did not commit and the fact that he sent a letter to the Court saying that he had been falsely accused and did not sexually assault anyone.
In addition, the Court considered fresh evidence that the appellant had refused to transfer to another institution in order to participate in high-intensity sex offender treatment pending his appeal.","[3, 2, 13, 21, 14, 12, 5, 1, 6, 15, 7, 0, 9, 8, 19, 18, 30, 35]"

MurrayHeard: September 30, 2010, in Sydney, Nova ScotiaWritten decision: October 21, 2010Counsel: Jeffery William Farrow in personKelsey Butts in personBy the Court: [1] The matter before the Court is an Appeal from a decision of the Smalls Claims Court of Nova Scotia.
[2] The Appellant appeals that decision by Notice of Appeal (form 9) dated June 16th, 2010, filed with the Court on the same date and, within the 30 day appeal period.
The singular ground of appeal cited in the Appellant’s Notice is a “Failure to Follow the Requirements of Natural Justice”.
[3] The particulars of the Appellant’s Appeal are based mainly on his claim that he did not know the hearing took place and, when he failed to show up, a Judgment was awarded against him.
The learned Adjudicator, after numerous attempts by the Respondent to serve the Appellant, issued an Order for Substituted Service.
These matters were both completed by the Respondent prior to the hearing date of May the 18th, 2010.
[5] In any Appeal under the Small Claims Court Act the Small Claims Court must issue to the Prothonotary a “Stated Case “for review by the Supreme Court on appeal.","The appellant appealed the Queen's Bench decision that denied him damages for defamation (see: 2010 SKQB 249).
The trial judge held that the defence of qualified privilege protected the Union and its representatives (the defendants in the action) when the latter republished a grievance defaming the appellant by falsely accusing him of having participated in the harassment of an employee.
The trial judge fixed a provisional award of $25,000.
The appellant's grounds of appeal were that the trial judge erred in finding that the defence applied and by assessing damages at $25,000.
The respondents cross-appealed on the ground that the trial judge had erred in denying them costs.
HELD: The Court held that the trial judge had erred in finding that the defence of qualified privilege applied.
Although she correctly identified the law, she had not correctly applied it because she had not given sufficient effect to 1) the wording of the defamatory expressions; 2) the circumstances in which they were published and, in particular, the chronology of events and the separate instances of publication; 3) the persons to whom the words were published; and 4) whether what was published on each occasion was germane and reasonably appropriate to the specific occasion.
In general, the Court noted that the respondents could have fulfilled their duty to notify its membership of the grievance filed by the member who alleged the harassment and made its effort to find witnesses to support the member's grievance by sending out a general notice.
It did not need to name the appellant and make the allegations it did to achieve its goal.
The respondent overreached, thereby placing the statement that the appellant had participated in the harassment of the employee outside the ambit of the defence of qualified privilege.
The Court awarded general damages in the amount of $100,000.
It held that the trial judge's assessment of damages was erroneous and founded upon mistaken principles of law.
The Court was not bound by the range of damages mentioned by the Supreme Court in the Church of Scientology decision but only to apply the principles established in it to the context of this case.
The provisional award of $25,000 for general damages was erroneous because the respondents published the documents by mailing them and placing them on the Union's website, over the strong objections of the employer.
The respondents left the documents on the website for 6 months after the employer demanded that they be removed.
The respondents had never offered an apology and appeared not to have recognized the harm that had been caused to the appellant.
An award of aggravated damages was subsumed in the general award and the Court agreed with the trial judge that punitive damages were not warranted because the respondent had not been motivated by malice.
The respondent's cross-appeal was dismissed without costs.
However, their position was clearly correct in the circumstances: it was not appropriate for the trial judge to decline to order costs in their favour on the basis of 'mixed results', because in defamation cases, the results are invariably mixed.","[5, 4, 0, 6, 1, 9, 7, 10, 2]"

The plaintiff, Tim Mosher, was a constable who was promoted to the rank of sergeant in 1995.

The Merchant Law Group and the Crown had been involved in protracted negotiations regarding the manner in which Merchant would bill the Crown for legal fees regarding their representation of Indian residential school claimants.
The parties eventually reached a 'Verification Agreement', respecting the verification of Merchant's legal fees and disbursements.
In order to protect solicitor-client privilege, Merchant's software company was able to develop redacted electronic billing records with the privileged information removed.
When Merchant did submit a bill, it was discovered that the electronic billing records were inaccurate.
The parties then became involved in a dispute regarding the Merchant's obligations under the Agreement.
They had each made an application to a Chambers judge acting in his capacity as an administrative judge for the purposes of the Agreement for directions.
The judge ordered (see: 2012 SKQB 517) that Merchant should contact its former software company and arrange for them to re-create the redacted electronic billing records as a whole from the 'live data' in the appellant's present billing program.
Before the software company would perform this task, the Court ordered Merchant to pay the outstanding fees.
Merchant had disputed these fees and had refused to pay them.
Merchant took the position that the administrative judge had exceeded his jurisdiction by requiring the law firm to make this payment: the judge had over-reached his authority.
In addition, the judge had based his decision on emails that were not evidence.HELD: The Court noted that leave to appeal under Court of Appeal Rule 11 is granted in accordance with the criteria established in Rothmans, Benson &amp; Hedges Inc. v. Saskatchewan.
Leave to appeal was denied.
The order appealed from was simply a discretionary order designed to move the verification process along and ensure the process met its overall objective of determining if the amount of Merchant's fee was reasonable and equitable.

The Director did not deny that the clerk of the Municipality received a copy of the notice of appeal within thirty days of the decision of the Regional Assessment Appeal Court.","HELD: The Court concluded that the $1,000 loan did not exist, there was nothing on the books showing an advance of wages as submitted by the plaintiff.
The Court was not satisfied that the defendant husband received a loan from the plaintiff in the amount of $5,000.
There was no loan documentation, which would be expected given the money was advanced from the plaintiff corporation.
The plaintiff never demanded any of the money be paid back until just before issuing the statement of claim.
The Court also held that the $5,000 to the defendant wife was a gift.
The counterclaim of $2,400 was not proven;
there was no evidence that these payments were not made with consent.
The $960 should not have been taken off of the defendant husband’s cheque because the $1,000 and $5,000 loans were not made out.
The defendant husband was successful in this portion of his counterclaim.
The Court found that $2,400 given to the plaintiff by the defendant wife was also by agreement.
The defendant wife’s testimony with respect to her hours worked were favoured over the plaintiff’s.
The defendant wife was overpaid for work in November so the plaintiff was only owed $32.32.
The plaintiff filed an inaccurate Record of Employment knowing that the defendant wife was trying to obtain employment insurance.
The amount of damages owing to the defendant wife was adjourned to allow her to make a new claim with Service Canada for employment insurance given the Court’s determination of her hours worked, which would be enough to qualify for employment insurance.","[1, 0, 3, 5, 4, 7, 6, 8, 9, 10, 2]"

The hearing of the appeal from conviction is scheduled for March 20, 1996.
The Crown opposes the application for release.
The appellant was convicted by a jury of two counts of sexual assault against his teenaged nieces.
The trial judge remanded the appellant until his sentencing which is scheduled for December 4, 1995.
The grounds of appeal are:1.
That the learned trial judge erred in law in failing to permit the testimony of a school teacher, who had been falsely accused of making sexual comments to the complainant [S.L.]
by the complainant, [S.L.].
2.
That the learned trial judge erred in law in refusing to permit cross­- examination of the complainant, [A.L.

The issue was whether the accused could be sentenced to a custodial disposition under s. 39(1)(d) of the Youth Criminal Justice Act.
HELD: The youth was sentenced to deferred custody.
The amount of cocaine was significant, the accused was the only person involved in the offence, it was a fairly unsophisticated operation, the impact on the small northern community where the offence occurred was huge, it is aggravating that the drug being trafficked was cocaine, the accused has a previous criminal record for trafficking, the place where the offence was committed is a friendship centre and a popular gathering spot for youth in the area and the offence was committed for financial gain.
The Court held that the most aggravating factor on sentence was that the accused was less than one month into a probation order imposed for trafficking cocaine and was to stay out of the province.
The Court held that it was impossible to conclude that the probation order the accused had previously been placed on had in any way achieved its goal of rehabilitation and reintegration of the offender.","[0, 1, 2, 4, 5, 6, 9, 7, 8, 11, 3, 12, 10, 13, 14]"

He was arraigned and entered a plea of not guilty.
As agreed in our Pre-trial Conference held by telephone on January 28, 1999 pursuant to s. 625.1(2) of the Criminal Code of Canada, we proceeded with a voir dire before empaneling a jury.

[2] The facts are fairly straightforward.
The parties were married October 19, 1984.
They have one child, Tyler Dean Puddifant, born January 6, 1989.
They separated in August 1996, after 12 years of marriage.
At the time of the hearing, the applicant and respondent were 46 and 42 years of age respectively.
Their 16 year old son has been living with his father since October 1996 except for a year (2003 - 2004) when he lived with his uncle.
The parties were divorced in 1998.
Paragraph four of the parties’ corollary relief judgment provides for spousal support as follows:4.
All payments shall be made through the Director of Maintenance Enforcement.
[4] Before the corollary relief judgment was granted, there was an interim order of $400.00 per month commencing April 1998.
[5] Throughout the marriage and continuing to this day, the respondent has suffered from serious mental illness.
[6] The applicant retired from the military in July 2004 after 25 years of service.
His evidence was that his family life came first.","HELD: The Court held that the replacement of former Queen’s Bench rule 212 requiring the production of documents “relating” to any matter in question and rule 222 permitting examination for discovery “touching” the matter in issue in the action by new rules 5-6, 5-18 and 5-25, which use the phrase: “relevant to any matter in issue”, showed the intention that the broad relevance test was no longer applicable.
The test under the new Rules was whether the matter qualifies as being material to the action based upon the matter as pled and whether the evidence tends to prove or disprove the matter in issue.
This inquiry must be balanced against the notion of proportionality set out in the foundational rules.
The Court dismissed the application, excepting the requested order under 3) wherein the defendant would fulfill its undertaking to have certain employees provide responses.
With respect to the rest of the relief requested under 1), which involved the undertaking that the defendant would search its records regarding the loading of railcars, the Court held that the as matter was not an issue in the action, based upon a review of the claim as pled.
Having regard to proportionality under the new rules, the defendant should not be required to answer the question in light of the effort and expense required versus the possible benefits.
The Court held that the plaintiffs were not entitled to ask the defendants to review a binder containing hundreds of pages of invoices assembled by the plaintiff regarding its expenditures incurred as a result of the derailment in order for it to advise the plaintiff which invoices the defendant believed were not related to it.
It was the plaintiff’s burden to prove its damages and the defendant was not required to assist the plaintiff to do so.
The plaintiff’s requested undertaking for the defendant to provide any background documents and information that went into the preparation of sketch of the railcar in question by the defendant’s adjuster was also denied.
The adjuster’s file was subject to litigation privilege and unless it was tendered as evidence at trial, there was no implied waiver of that privilege.
Regarding the plaintiff’s request in 2), the Court agreed with the defendants that that plaintiff’s request that the defendant answer questions now, rather than after it had completed questioning of the plaintiff, was premature.
The defendant had not yet taken a position on the cause of the derailment and they would advise the plaintiff when they had developed one.
Rule 5-31 makes it an ongoing obligation to correct answers and there was no evidence in this application that the rules had not been complied with.
The Court awarded costs in the amount of $1,500 to the defendants due to the complexity of the application, requiring the submission of briefs of law and the amount of time taken to argue them matters in Chambers.","[3, 2, 11, 1, 4, 7, 15, 9, 6, 13, 8, 5, 14, 16, 20]"

[7] The cutting activity was not obvious from the Claimants’ home.","The petitioner mother has entered into a new relationship and is pregnant.
She wants to move with the parties' two children to live with her new spouse.
The respondent father is currently in jail and will be incarcerated for the balance of the calendar year.
The respondent opposes the move and wants access to his children at the jail.
The mother had unilaterally moved with the children prior to making this application in the face of an existing court order.
One of the reasons that respondent is in jail is because he assaulted the petitioner.
HELD: The Court was of the view that this was an exceptional case that warranted permitting the move on an interim basis.
The petitioner's new relationship and the impending birth of a new sibling for the children is a material change in circumstances.
The move is justified because the petitioner is the only parent available to the children and it would defy common sense to deprive the children of a relationship with their new sibling, particularly when the respondent is unavailable as a parent and there is no reasonable basis to conclude that matters can be resolved in the father's favour.
The respondent asked to have the issue of custody and access delayed until his release.
This is not a realistic option.
It was clear that the father had not truly considered the best interests of his children in opposing this application and that the mother's position would likely prevail at trial.
With respect to access with the father in jail, there was no evidence that visiting the respondent in jail would be beneficial to these young children.
The respondent was granted telephone access and, if it was possible to arrange with corrections officials, access via Skype or Face Time.","[3, 4, 5, 2, 1, 10, 19, 7, 6, 18, 8, 17]"

51-084705 In the Matter of the Consumer Proposal of Catherine Field-CurrieD E C I S I O N Registrar: Richard W. Cregan, Q.C.","The appellants appealed a small claims judgment.
The judgment had found the appellants liable for damages after the respondent, who had purchased a house from the appellants, discovered that water was entering his basement.
When the respondent investigated the source of the water, he removed the interior wall of the basement and discovered that there was a second wall behind the first one.
He also discovered that a large chunk of the concrete footing and concrete grade beam were broken and had slid into the space between the interior basement wall.
The respondent obtained a professional opinion that suggested that the problem had been there for a significant period of time and that the wooden beam that sat on the concrete grade beam was rotten and would have to be replaced.
The respondent was awarded judgment in the amount of the repair.
The appellant appealed on the basis that the trial judge should not have considered the respondent's expert's opinion about the age of the defect, that the trial judge had crossed a line in assisting the self-represented plaintiff at the trial and that the trial judge erred in calculating damages.
HELD: The appeal was dismissed.
The respondent's expert was qualified as an expert concerning foundation repair and had the necessary experience to give expert evidence on the type of structural repair and the need for structural repair.
Once qualified as an expert in the area of foundations and structural repair, he could testify on the nature of the foundation's problems, including the wooden beam.
The witness was also the person who actually carried out the repair to the foundation and was entitled to give evidence on what he saw and did.
The witness was properly qualified by virtue of his years of experience and the trial judge was entitled to accept his evidence as to the state of the foundation and how long it had been in such a state.
The trial judge's intervention and comments to the appellant's lawyer at the trial did not go beyond the nature of a legitimate attempt to ensure that all of the evidence regarding the matters at issue was before the Court with sufficient clarity to allow the trial judge to understand it.
The cause of action in this case was negligent misrepresentation.
The trial judge found that the appellants were aware of the structural defect and had covered it up.
The proper measure of damages is the amount of money required to put the plaintiff in the position he would have occupied if the negligent misrepresentation had not been made.
In this case, the judge made no palpable or overriding error in calculating damages at the amount it cost to fix the foundation.","[1, 2, 5, 3, 8, 6, 7, 9, 0, 11, 10, 13, 14, 4, 15]"

DECISION: May 29, 1990 COUNSEL: George MacDonald, Solicitor for the ApplicantRobert Barnes and A.

The application for the interim injunction is made pending the outcome of an application for certiorari quashing the decision of the disciplinary panel of the I.D.A.
which application will be heard in the Supreme Court Trial Division on September 6, 1990.
The application for certiorari is joined with an application for an order in the nature of prohibition restraining the I.D.A.

The history of the proceedings leading up to this application is lengthy and is contained in the affidavits of Douglas Caldwell and Mary Margaret Fox, which were filed on this application.

were on routine patrol in the area of the Government Wharf in Western Shore, Lunenburg County, Nova Scotia.
There had been prior mischief complaints from the public regarding activity in the area and the officers approached several youth standing near vehicles on the wharf.
One of the Constables was able to view through the window of one of the vehicles two open bottles of beer on the console.
Upon asking who owned the vehicle a young male came forward by the name of Josh Hyslop.
The officers advised they were going to search the vehicle for liquor and then found in the rear hatch area of the vehicle a cooler which contained more alcohol.
In searching the front passenger area of the vehicle, the officer went to move a knapsack on the floor to check for further liquor under the passenger seat.
The backpack was opened upon which narcotics were found together with a large amount of cash.
Additionally in the front pocket was the wallet of the accused containing identification papers, licenses and personal papers.","The Court allowed the application in part.
It struck the portion of the claim with respect to damages from debris falling from the defendants’ tree.
Even if proven, the damages were part of urban life.
The plaintiff claimed for injunctive relief ordering the trees to be removed.
The Court had no jurisdiction to grant this relief.

[2] This trial turns very much on the facts of the case that the Court will find having regard to all of the evidence and, in particular, whether Constable Marriott’s evidence concerning what he observed of this alleged street level drug transaction constitutes proof beyond a reasonable doubt that the accused, Mr. Carvery, committed these offences with which he has been charged.
[4] On April 7th, 2010, Mr. Carvery, the alleged trafficker, and Mr. Burke, the individual who purchased one stone of cocaine, were both arrested within minutes of the alleged events near and at the trafficking location.
Constable Marriott had the use of expensive binoculars to view the encounter.
[5] In an earlier ruling, I determined that the Crown’s motion for observation post privilege was valid (see 2011 NSSC 283 (CanLII)).
[6] In aide of the motion for waiver, defence counsel had earlier placed in evidence a series of photographs of the neighbourhood and the transaction location that were taken 14 months after the event in June, 2011.","HELD: The appeal was allowed.
The conviction was set aside and a new trial ordered.
The court found that the trial judge erred by misapplying the test in Chaplin.
He wrongly placed the burden on the defence to demonstrate the relevance of existing documents that the Crown refused to disclose.
The court found that in light of the Crown’s late disclosure and non-disclosure, the trial judge erred by not a granting an adequate remedy to address the breach of s. 7 of the Charter by the Crown.
In his decision regarding the adjournment request, the trial judge also erred in describing the index in this case as a Laporte inventory, a finding that allowed him to conclude that the Crown had met its disclosure obligations.
The index was not a Laporte inventory as it was prepared for a different purpose and did not provide sufficient detail to permit the defence to decide whether to seek disclosure.","[2, 3, 4, 1, 5, 6, 12, 13, 10, 15, 8]"

There was no evidence that the accused’s spouse was in any way involved.
The evidence established that all of the file-sharing traffic came into the accused’s residence through a router that directed everything to the red computer only.
The encryption on the red computer was so formidable that the best forensic technicians from the RCMP were not able to get past it.

Counsel: Appellant on his own behalf Respondents on their own behalf Reasons for judgment:[1] At issue in this appeal is the ownership of monies in a joint bank account in the names of the late Elizabeth Scott and Jeanne Akerley.
At Mrs. Scott’s passing, over $50,000 was held on deposit in that account.
The appellant, Frank Comeau, and the respondents, Ms. Akerley and Rachel Gregoire, are children of the deceased.
Ms. Gregoire serves as adminstratrix of the estate of her late mother.
All parties were self-represented on the appeal.
[2] This is the second appeal before this court which pertained to the estate of the late Mrs. Scott.
In Scott Estate (Re), 2005 NSCA 135 (CanLII), the court allowed an appeal by Mr. Comeau from an order passing the final account of the adminstratrix, set aside that order, and remitted the matter to the probate court to determine the ownership of two joint bank accounts, one of which is the subject of this appeal.
The funds in the other joint account were subsequently turned over to the estate.
[3] The late Mrs. Scott’s situation and her family were summarized by Justice Roscoe in that earlier decision as follows:[2] Elizabeth Scott, a 90 year old widow, died without a will on June 15, 2002.
Two lived in New Brunswick: Mr. Comeau (the appellant) and Jeanne Ackerly [sic].","HELD: The application was dismissed.
The court found that the 51 months between the charges and the scheduled trial was sufficiently long to warrant an inquiry into the reasonableness of the delay.
As the accused had specifically and voluntarily waived almost five months of the delay, the court deducted that amount, leaving 46 months to be considered.
The various types of delay were considered by the court: 11.5 for inherent delay; 15.5 months to be attributed to the actions of the accused; 10 months to be attributed to the Crown; and 10 months to institutional delay.
The court found that the accused had not suffered prejudice and as most of the delay was attributable to adjournments sought on his behalf, the court found that the overall delay in this case was not unreasonable.","[2, 1, 3, 6, 8, 5, 9, 4, 7, 11, 12, 16, 10]"

The defendants had defamed the plaintiff and he was entitled to damages in the amount of $100,000.
The court found the following with respect to each issue: 1) it would substitute Postmedia as a defendant pursuant to Queen’s Bench rule 3-84(2) as it was the successor to Canwest and was aware of the plaintiff’s claim when it purchased the Star Phoenix and it would not be prejudiced.
It would not deprive Postmedia of a defence under s. 5 of The Limitations Act because the articles remained on Postmedia’s websites and were republished whenever they were viewed or downloaded; 2) after reviewing each of the articles and assessing the words complained of, it found that the words constituted defamation; 3) all of the defendants were found to be joint tortfeasors with Purdy because they participated in the publication of a libel and were jointly and severally liable in defamation to the plaintiff; and 3) an appropriate award for general damages was $50,000.
The court allowed the claim for aggravated damages as the defendants were found to be motivated by actual or express malice because Purdy did not simply report the jury’s verdict in her articles but indicated that she believed that the jury had not reached the proper verdict in the trial.
She deliberately chose to report the stories of people who had made complaints about the surgical care provided to them by the plaintiff without verifying it or seeking comment from the plaintiff.
As she was acting in the course of her employment, Purdy’s malice was attributed to all the defendants.

THE FACTS[4] On December 27, 2011, the three accused went out for a few drinks.
Their alcohol consumption was extensive and prolonged and all three accused became extremely intoxicated.
[5] It would appear from statements provided by the accused to the police that during the course of the evening of December 27th, the three accused shared some information with each other about Mr. Cowan.
Mr. Hill did not receive a TV.
Initially, he tried to make this complaint anonymously.
[7] In Mr. Manulak’s statement to the police, he described a similar experience on December 22, 2011 involving his brother Jason.
Mr. Manulak indicated that this incident was also reported to the police.
[9] So during a night of drinking, these three intoxicated young men discussed Mr. Cowan’s actions and decided to take some action of their own.
[10] When the three accused arrived at Mr. Cowan’s residence, they pounded on the door to gain entrance.
He opened the door for the other two accused.
It would appear that the events involving the assault on Mr. Cowan took approximately three and a half to four minutes.

All four matters have common defendants, namely RBC Dominion Securities Inc. and Frank Youden.

In all four actions, the defendants are represented by Mr. Campbell of Blakes.

[6] In their thorough written submissions, the Applicants clearly focussed upon establishing why consolidation (pursuant to Rule 37.02) of the four actions was an appropriate remedy.
Although the Applicants did reference the possibility of the matters being heard together (pursuant to Rule 37.03) in their written submissions, such was clearly not the preferred remedy sought.","The issue in this appeal was whether a landlord can give notice of a rental increase at any time during a yearly tenancy under the Standard Form Lease.

The Director’s application was brought pursuant to s. 7 of the Act on the ground that the vehicle had been used in criminal activity.
II.
background [2] Ms. Brinkman and the respondent Aaron Tropeau are common-law spouses.
[3] The vehicle in question (the “Vehicle”) is a 2010 Ford Transit Cargo Van.
Ms. Brinkman purchased it in 2010, with money received from her father’s estate.
Beginning in January of 2012, she and Mr. Tropeau used it to haul items on an on-call basis.
The business averaged $3,000 in profit every month.
[4] In March of 2012, Mr. Tropeau was seen removing copper material from the back of a truck.
As a witness approached the scene, Ms. Brinkman (who was sitting in the Vehicle) called out a warning to Mr. Tropeau.
[5] A second incident occurred on March 29, 2012.","The plaintiff appealed the defendant's decision to grant a partial tax refund only under the Health Services Tax Act.
The plaintiff had sought a full refund of tax paid on refrigeration equipment at a pickled herring plant (whose product was to be supplied on contract overseas) on the ground the equipment was used in the 'manufacture or production of goods for sale.'
The contract stipulated that most of the processing occur at controlled cold temperatures.
The defendant apportioned tax based on the time the equipment was used in the actual 'transformation or conversion' of the product.
For the plaintiff,
that (1) the tax exemption did not depend on the extent to which the equipment was used in the manufacturing process; and (2) since the contract required most of the process to occur under refrigeration, the use of a cold room was part of the 'manufacture or production' of the product.","[3, 4, 5, 6, 1, 12, 10, 7, 11, 9, 8, 0]"
934,"She is also charged that on the same date she breached a probation order by failing to keep the peace and be of good behaviour.
[2] The complainant Jennifer Buchanan is a child protection worker employed by the Saskatchewan Ministry of Social Services.
After the complainant and police entered the accused’s apartment suite, the accused kicked and hit the complainant.
There is no doubt that Ms. Bigsky’s actions could legally constitute an assault.
The defence also argues that the complainant and police subjected the accused to an unlawful and unreasonable search and seizure, and infringed her rights contrary to section 8 of the Charter.
The defence asks that the evidence that was obtained following the unlawful entry into the accused’s home be excluded.
THE EVIDENCE[3] The defence admitted the identity of the accused and the jurisdiction of the court.
It also admitted that on March 23, 2015, the accused was under a probation order that required her to keep the peace and be of good behaviour.
[4] The complainant, Jennifer Buchanan testified that she is a child protection worker employed by the Saskatchewan Ministry of Social Services.
In January, 2015, she began working with the complainant.
[5] Ms. Buchanan testified that the accused has three children.","The appellant contended the trial judge erred in sentencing him to four years for an armed robbery charge, one year on a weapons charge to be served consecutively and a 10 year prohibition order because there were extenuating circumstances which should have resulted in a reduction in sentence.

Cst.
David Cobbledick, of the Kamsack RCMP, had a motorist pulled over at 2:50 a.m. in the village of Togo.
Just as he was completing that stop, he heard a truck, which turned out to be one driven by Mr. Lehman, on an adjacent street.
[3] After finishing with the first motorist, he drove to the street on which he had first heard Mr. Lehman’s truck, and followed a dust trail from the truck down that street until he saw Mr. Lehman coming around a corner, in his words “kind of creeping”.
He engaged his emergency lights, and came up behind his truck.
Mr. Lehman spun his tires and fish-tailed, and in the officer’s words sped up rapidly and “took off”.

RESPONDENTCounsel: Brent D. Barilla, Q.C.
[2] On August 18, 2016 the petitioner received, on a without notice application, an interim order of this court granting her exclusive possession of the family home.
Although no reasons were given on the granting of the interim exclusive possession order, the petitioner’s grounds for so applying stated: 9.
… the respondent’s anger management issues have made it untenable for them to continue to reside in the same home.
The petitioner is fearful of the respondent’s reaction to receiving and reviewing the information outlined in her application materials.
The respondent takes the position that this order should not have been granted in the circumstances of this case.
For his part he provides evidence of anger displayed by the petitioner towards him and the children.
He says that prior to the petitioner obtaining an exclusive possession order the petitioner was asking him to leave the family home.
He seeks to have the exclusive possession order terminated and an order providing for shared parenting of the children.
The petitioner is a [profession stated] who has since they began cohabiting practised as such in Saskatoon.

Nevertheless, my task has been to review the decision of the Tribunal to determine if it made any of the numerous errors alleged by the appellant such that its decision is rendered unreasonable or, in one case, incorrect.
Background Facts [4] A significant amount of material was filed on this application, and the record from the Tribunal ran to some 2,000 pages.
The facts disclosed by that record are only summarized herein.
Note is made of those facts which bear upon the application and the analysis of same.
The parties may rest assured that the entirety of the record has been reviewed by the court, in detail.

The appellant practiced there for about a dozen years prior to these proceedings.

The actual evidence seized was not disclosed at the hearing.
It is apparently located on either the accused’s laptop computer or his cell phone.

The Crown called evidence to amplify the statements set forth in the Information to Obtain a Warrant to Search [ITO].
The admissibility of this evidence is in issue.

He disputed the facial validity of the search warrant.

[2] The Crown’s first witness was Constable Blair De Bruin, an eight year member with the RCMP stationed in Rosetown.
[3] On December 18, 2016, he was doing traffic enforcement on highway #31 near Herschel, Saskatchewan, a village some thirty kilometres from Rosetown.
When the oncoming vehicle was about 100 - 150 metres from the police vehicle it veered off the main road and down what Constable De Bruin called a “goat trail”.
The accused, who was the driver, had blood shot eyes.
His speech was slurred.
He advised Constable De Bruin that he drank three beer.
[5] At this point, Constable De Bruin testified “I formed the grounds to suspect that he had alcohol in his body .","This was an appeal from a trial court decision questioning whether the trial judge erred in determining that the appellant's rights under s.7 and s.8 of the Charter had not been violated.
When man involved in an accident checked himself into hospital, the attending physician informed the RCMP of the accident and an RCMP officer came to the hospital.
As the appellant had indicated to the physician that he had been drinking, the RCMP constable read demand for blood sample, which the attending physician attempted to obtain.
The appellant refused and asked to speak to his lawyer.
Unable to contact lawyer, the appellant refused to supply blood sample and was charged with refusal under s. 254(2) of the Criminal Code.
The trial judge had held that as the physician attempted to obtain sample for medical purposes, he was not acting in the capacity of agent of the state, and his actions were not subject to the Charter.
Dismissing the appeal,
that while there may have been some issues of breach of confidentiality, the physician's actions were not analogous to search and seizure within s.8 of the Charter.
The trial judge did not err in determining that the appellant's rights were not violated under either s.7 or s.8 of the Charter.","[2, 8, 11, 5, 9, 10, 1, 3]"

Since the evidence was to the effect that marihuana plants did not start arriving until early June, I grant amendment of the indictment to cover the period June 1, 2016 to September 15, 2016.
[3] Cannabis marihuana was being grown during the period and at the location particularized in the charges against them on property the accused owned.
The central issues with respect to the charges are whether the Crown has proven beyond a reasonable doubt that: a.
They were unlawfully producing cannabis; b.
They possessed the cannabis for the purposes of trafficking; and c. The currency in question was obtained by the commission in Canada of an offence punishable by indictment.
[4] The defendants testified.
Their evidence, in extreme summary, was that: a.
The marihuana being grown on their property was being grown by another individual or individuals to whom they had leased the property for that purpose; b.
It asked for the assistance of an RCMP emergency response team [ERT].
[6] Their observations caused them to believe marihuana was being produced on the subject property.","The petitioner sought a divorce, custody, spousal and child support and an unequal division of matrimonial property.
The respondent counter-petitioned for similar relief, including divorce, joint custody and an equal division of the property.
HELD: 1)Sole custody was awarded to the mother with access on the same terms as contained in the interim order.
Two reasons for not awarding joint custody were the obvious acrimony between the parties and the respondent's reluctance to support his children.
Three weeks after his application for sale of the home was rejected, he applied for a leave of absence from his job.
It was inferred that he was trying to avoid complying with the order for interim support.
2)The mother re-entered the workforce after many years' absence.
She suffered an economic disadvantage from the marriage and its breakdown.
3)The car owned by the petitioner when she married was exempt property.
The motorcycle was disregarded as there had not been a significant increase in value.
The list prepared by the respondent was used to divide household goods, tools and equipment.
4)The respondent was to assume one-half of the bank loan and it was agreed that the pension funds should be shared equally.
5)It would be unfair and inequitable to the custodial parent to order an equal division of the matrimonial property.
The petitioner was granted possession of the matrimonial home until the younger child's 18th birthday or until she vacated the property.
6)The respondent cannot avoid his responsibility of providing an adequate level of support by turning his back on well-paid employment.

The Crown applied to have a witness, who was an unindicted co-conspirator and separately charged with drug offences arising out of the same investigation, declared adverse pursuant to s9 of the Canada Evidence Act.
She had contradicted her prior video taped statement made shortly after her arrest and had demonstrated hostile attitude towards the Crown.
The defence took the position that she was now telling the truth; that the statement was improperly obtained in breach of the confession rules of voluntariness and the statement did not meet the requirements set out in R. v. K.G.B.
HELD: The witness' prior statement may be introduced in evidence for the substantive truth of its contents.
It will be for the jury to decide what, if any, portions of such statement they wish to accept.
1)A prior inconsistent statement cannot be introduced in evidence for its substantive content, unless the requirement of necessity, and a threshold of reliability arrived at on a balance of probabilities are established.
When, as here, a witness recants, the requirement of necessity is established.
The real issue is whether the prior statement meets the test for reliability.
When, as here, there is only one demonstrably false piece of testimony in the statement, which does not implicate anyone but rather attempts to exonerate someone, the Court was not prepared to say ipso facto the statement is unreliable.
2)The independent evidence sufficiently corroborated her statement in enough different particulars that, but for the demonstrably false portion, it met the threshold of reliability.","[2, 5, 8, 12, 17, 15, 22, 11, 13, 30, 31]"

A.D. 1997 No.
March 3, 2000[1] The issues herein centre around a claim by John George Len (the “plaintiff”) against the Woodlawn Regional Park Authority (the “defendant”) for unpaid holiday pay.
[2] The plaintiff sued for damages from the defendant alleging he was constructively wrongfully dismissed from his employment with the defendant.
The plaintiff elected to have the determination of liability and the assessment of damages determined by a civil jury.
The jury determined that the plaintiff was constructively dismissed and awarded the plaintiff damages.
[3] In addition to the claim for damages for failure to give reasonable notice of termination, the plaintiff asserted a claim against the defendant for unpaid holiday pay that he alleged was owing to him at the date of termination.
The plaintiff bases his entitlement to holiday pay on the provisions of The Labour Standards Act, R.S.S.
1978 c. L-1 (the “LSA”).
As a result, the trial of this matter was reconvened before myself, for a determination on the issue of the plaintiff’s claim for unpaid holiday pay.

In one posting on the website on June 18, 2005 he wrote:I am getting pissed off with the apathy in this ... group.

945,"This appeal was allowed from the bench with brief written reasons to follow.
These are the reasons.
The appeal is from an order that determined, after trial of an issue, that the parties had reached a binding agreement as to the value of Dr. Verma's pension plan during negotiations which took place during a series of pre-trial conferences.
The judge, in her reasons, outlined the background as follows: Dr. Sheo Verma and his ex-wife, Rita Verma, separated in 1983 and were divorced in 1989.
Mrs. Verma commenced her action for division of matrimonial property on May 1, 1985 and Dr. Verma petitioned for divorce in 1988.
The question of the division of certain of the matrimonial assets has been a contentious one and the fact that there is property in Germany and India as well as in Saskatchewan has complicated matters.
The sequence of events relative to the division of Dr. Verma's pension benefits is as follows: November 15, 1988 - Examinations for discovery of Dr. and Mrs. Verma.
Both gave undertakings to produce certain documents.
June 9, 1989 - First pre-trial conference.
The pre-trial judge made no written memorandum but advised the parties to record what had been agreed upon that day.","The applicants sought an order under s.11 of the Landlord and Tenant Act vesting the whole term of their sub-lease with either VIP Business Centre (VIP) or 598710 Saskatchewan Ltd (SaskLtd).
Bennett, owner of an office building (the Plaza), leased space to VIP for five years ending in 1997.
Issues included (i)whether there had been a valid renewal of the head lease; (ii)whether there had been valid renewals of sub-leases; (iii)assuming valid renewals, did s4 of the Statute of Frauds bar enforcement against Bennett; (iv)whether the Court had jurisdiction to hear an application for relief under s11 brought solely by notice of motion; (v)are the applicants entitled to such relief; (vi)whether Bennett was bound by the sub-leases by virtue of taking the assignment from VIP.
HELD: The application was dismissed.
1)It was assumed that the evidence led by the applicants was true in order to determine issues (iii) and (iv) which dispose of the application.
Issues (i), (ii) and (vi) could not be dealt with summarily because of the conflicting affidavits.
2)Notwithstanding Queen's Bench Rule 13(1), the term action in s11 includes summary application by way of notice of motion.
There is no reason for landlords to have better access to this Court than the tenants concerning possession of demised premises.
The words 'or otherwise' include extrajudicial actions by landlords, including re-entry.
Had it been concluded that it was necessry to proceed by statement of claim, such error would have been procedural one, curable under Rule without affecting the jurisdiction of the Court. 3)The Court should exercise its discretion within the guidelines outlined in Golden Griddle.
grant of relief requested by the applicant would constitute an improper exercise of such discretion.
They were not the sole tenant in stand alone building of the kind in Chatham Empire Theatre.
The relief sought would unfairly affect the landlord.
As the applicants expressed no interest in taking over the whole head lease premises on the terms of the head lease, there was no need for a conditional order of the nature of London Bridge.
4)The only memoranda consisted of the original head lease and subleases and the unsigned fax messages.
The fax messages did not meet the essential requirements for a valid lease.
The actions and performance by VIP and the applicant fell short of constituting part performance for the purposes of s.4 regardless of a narrow or broad interpretation of the doctrine.
In any case the Court would not have exercised its discretion by binding Bennett with leases which comprised less than 15% of the head premises in the absence of evidence that clearly demonstrated the owner's ability to rent out the balance of the head lease premises was not impaired economically or physically.
The applciants could obtain other office space including that offered by Bennett.
General and punitive damages would provide an adequate remedy.","[1, 2, 4, 3, 5, 8, 6, 10, 7, 13]"

.","The bankrupt applied to annul his bankruptcy on the grounds that he received misinformation or had a misunderstanding concerning the effect of an assignment on the status of potential builders' lien claimants and because his assets had been undervalued.
He also asserted that the bankruptcy proceedings were of no value to him as builders' lien claimants have status akin to secured creditors and could pursue the bankrupt personally for any deficiency that may arise if the home is sold and the proceeds distributed among the claimants.
The trustee maintained the bankrupt was repeatedly advised or cautioned that bankruptcy may not affect the majority of his creditors.
Subsequent appraisals placed the value of his unfinished home at $150,000 rather than $40,000.
The bankrupt was now eligible to obtain mortgage financing but first had to get out of bankruptcy.
The bankrupt had attempted an orderly payment of debts prior to bankruptcy and had considered proposal post-bankruptcy.
HELD: The application for an order annulling the assignment was dismissed.
1)The bankrupt met the definition of an insolvent person at the date of the assignment.
It would be dangerous to set a precedent which would allow such an application because of post-bankruptcy circumstances.
An improved financial situation and the ability to pay debts in full should not be used as criteria to launch section181 application.
2)The bankrupt had not filed monthly financial statements nor made payments as agreed to cover the costs of the administration of the estate.

[4] THE FACTS[5] On April 14, 1997 Sawkiw was in a motor vehicle accident and suffered soft tissue injuries to his cervical spine.
His vehicle was struck from behind by an uninsured driver.
Sawkiw is a farmer and pursuant to the Act, he received a partial income replacement benefit from SGI on the basis that he was not able to perform some but not all of his farm duties.
Following the accident and until August, 1997 he was receiving physiotherapy two to three times per week in Preeceville where he lives.
As his condition was not improving, SGI arranged for a secondary assessment to be done on August 17, 1997 at a physiotherapy clinic in Yorkton.
Following this assessment, Sawkiw was scheduled for daily physiotherapy in Yorkton commencing September 24.
This physiotherapy was to continue for a period of six weeks with three to four hours of rehabilitation each day.
While attending physiotherapy in Yorkton, Sawkiw was entitled to receive mileage and a meal allowance in addition to the partial income replacement benefits.
Sawkiw attended physiotherapy in Yorkton on September 24, 25, 26 and 29.
[6] October 1 was not a good day for Sawkiw.","In issue was whether the parties cohabited for more than 90 days and thereby vitiate their 1996 separation agreement to live separate and apart.

In the alternative the applicant seeks an order preventing the respondent from removing their daughter from the Province of Saskatchewan.
The application arises out of the respondent's declared intention to move to Kelowna, British Columbia.
The parties separated in October, 1994.
The daughter, Letitia, age 7, has been in the care of her mother (the respondent) since that time.
Under the terms of the consent judgment of May 2, 1995, the respondent has custody of Letitia.
The applicant has reasonable access at all reasonable times upon reasonable notice, including every second weekend and every Wednesday evening.
The respondent says, and the applicant did not take issue with the fact that she had always been the primary care giver.
During the marriage she was a stay-at-home mom and raised their daughter.
The applicant says he has exercised his access rights on a regular basis.
He says he and his daughter have a close and loving relationship.
They engage in various activities together.
The respondent does not deny this and says she has made efforts to ensure the applicant has access beyond the minimum prescribed by the consent judgment.
The applicant says that the respondent advised him she was moving to Kelowna because she needed a change.","An application for variation of child support pursuant to the Federal Child Support Guidelines including an amount for extraordinar expenses of $3,900 for orthodontic work.

HELD:1)The father was to pay $454 for child support for the two children who lived with the mother.
His proportionate share of orthodontic expenses was 86% ($1,677) to be paid by five payments of $280.
2)The respondent's average income over 1994-96 for the purpose of determining child support was $32,243.39.
The 1997 income information was not included because the financial evidence was insufficient.
15% of the capital cost allowance was imputed pursuant to s19 for the 1994-96 taxation years.
Deducting all of the respondent's capital cost allowance was not a reasonable expense.
An adverse inference was not drawn from the failure to produce the financial records of the respondent's farming partner.
3)The applicant's average income for 1994-96 for purposes of calculating the s7 expense was $5,278.40.

The application is opposed by one of the creditors, namely, Oak Bluff Estates Ltd. (""Oak Bluff"").
At the meeting of the unsecured creditors to approve the proposal, six unsecured creditors voted against the approval representing approximately $430,000 of the indebtedness of the Gustafson.
Forty-four unsecured creditors voted in favour of the proposal, representing approximately $1,800,000 of the indebtedness and thus the statutory requirement for the approval of the proposal was met.
Only Oak Bluff, representing approximately 3% of the indebtedness, appeared in opposition to the application for Court approval.

Pursuant to s. 117 of the Act, and s. 24 of The Personal Injury Benefits Regulations, c.A-35, Reg.
3 (the “Regulations”), I found that Montgrand’s IRB for the 181st and subsequent days following an accident should not be less than the IRB calculated for the first 180 days after the accident, as determined pursuant to s. 116 of the Act.
2) This interpretation of the Act and Regulations was upheld by the Saskatchewan Court of Appeal, cited at 2007 SKCA 103 (CanLII).

It argues that the Act is intended to correlate a victim's income replacement benefit with his or her earning reality.

To that end, it prepared a notice of appeal in approved form and sent it by registered mail to the administrator of the R.M.

One of the nine plaintiffs, legal representatives of passengers killed in a helicopter crash in 1995, and two defendants sought better testimonial and documentary discovery.
Objections to questions or to the production of documents at the examinations for discovery fell under relevance and privilege.
The plaintiffs alleged the defendants carried on a negligent and reckless shuttle service to and from the work site and that the Cameco group could not avoid liability by reason of having hired the Kyrgyzstan National Airline as an independent contractor.
HELD: 1)Relevancy.
The plaintiffs were entitled to question officers of the corporations and receive production of all documents touching on the issues of why the helicopter and the airline were selected; who made these decisions and whether KOC was the alter ego or agent for Cameco in this respect; whether the airline was unsafe; if so, should any of the defendants have known it was unsafe; was it inherently dangerous; and if so, could the defendants rely on the independent contractor defence.
Questions relating to availability, cost and reliability of alternative forms of transportation were logically relevant.
Questions as to topography were relevant as background information and supported the allegation the shuttle was inherently dangerous.
Whether the project was over budget was relevant but the budget itself was not.
Although questions directed at whether insurance was arranged and by whom were to be answered, the information is not automatically admissible at trial.
Questions relating to the e-mail system and when survival gear was placed on board were properly answerable.
Records as to when the tickets were reserved and purchased were to be produced.
Counsel is not required to justify why every particular question is asked.
The relationship between Cameco and it various subsidiaries was in issue and the information as to when the president met certain people was broadly relevant.
Leave was granted to reapply for direction.
2)Privilege:(a)The defendants were ordered to date any document for which privilege was claimed.
The document must be sufficiently identified to allow the opposing party to assess whether the claim for privilege should be challenged.
(b)The request for names of the persons who prepared documents was simply an attempt to investigate the investigation and was not permitted.
The Rules of Court do not require the names of expert witnesses who prepared reports for which privilege is claimed.
The same rationale applies to non- expert privileged memoranda.
(c)Pre-accident observations disclosed to someone in the subsequent privileged investigation are disclosable.
The plaintiff is entitled to ask the name of any employee who expressed safety concerns about the shuttle prior to the accident.
While matters of opinion only, such concerns are disclosable.
A reciprocal order with respect to the names of potential witnesses was made in favour of the defendants.
(d)Litigation privilege attaches only until such time as party determines to utilize the document at trial.
Under the Rules of Court party must disclose any such document and produce any existing expert reports prior to the pre-trial conference.
(e)The report on safety equipment and survival gear prepared by the KOC Safety Superintendent was to be reviewed by the court to assess whether or to what extent it was privileged.
It was not known whether the Report prepared after litigation included matters other than what the Superintendent was requested to report on prior to the accident.
(f)It was ordered that information given by a former senior level KOC employee would not amount to a breach of the confidentiality agreement.
The agreement not to disclose any proprietary information, including business information, was broad enough to include privileged investigations carried out by the employer.
Counsel for KOC and Kilborn were permitted to be present at the interview.
(g)The chronology document was privileged on the basis it represented the product of a privileged investigation.
3)The necessary criteria under Rule 222(a) was not established to justify examining for discovery the two former employees.
The request to explore post accident conduct of senior executives was dismissed.
Seeking to establish alternate forms of transportation was irrelevant to the issues.
4)Particulars of the statutes and regulations referred to in the statement of claim, sought under Rule 142, were to be supplied within 45 days.
5)The question asking the spouse if in her opinion her husband would have boarded an aircraft he felt was unsafe was improper as framed.
The question was relevant only to character.
Character evidence is limited to reputation in the community and does not allow for personal opinion.

.
.
[3] The question arises whether this Court has jurisdiction to direct security in the present circumstances and, if so, whether it should do so.
[4] Basic facts alleged are not in dispute.
Wind Power Inc. is an Alberta company extra-provincially registered in Saskatchewan.
It has developed wind power installations in Alberta.
Dove Industries, Inc. is a Saskatchewan company.
It was formed for the purpose of initiating and developing a pilot project in Saskatchewan.
Its shareholders are farmers in the Swift Current district.
So we have a situation where we have resident and non-resident plaintiffs.
[5] Rule 547 is limited to cases where the plaintiff is a non-resident, or where the defendant is given a statutory right to apply.
The latter prerequisite does not exist here.
The former applies only as to one of the plaintiffs.

In this case, all of the claims to which B was a party were joint and therefore security could not be ordered.","FIAT. It was held in an earlier fiat in June that the addition of the two proposed plaintiffs asserted new causes of action and amendments to the statement of claim could only be considered pursuant to an application under s.44(11) of the Queen's Bench Act.
The defendant resisted the joinder of the new plaintiffs and amendments on the basis of undue delay and actual prejudice.
The statement of claim alleged nuisance, and in the alternative, negligence against the City with respect to the design, construction and maintenance of the sewer system causing his basement to flood.
The plaintiffs stated they only became aware of the damage to their home and possible health problems over period of time.
Leave to appeal the June fiat was denied.
The defendant plead limitation period defence to the amendment and argued that if the City had received notice of any ongoing problems it would have investigated and possibly taken steps to minimize any damage; that evidence had been lost; it may be too late to determine the causes.
HELD: The amendments were allowed.
1)The limitation period in s.314(1) applies from the time damages were sustained, not from the date of the occurrence which led to the damage.
The facts were uncertain.

Halyk for the CrownFIAT LAING J.December 8, 1998[1] The accused seeks an order for a judicial stay of proceedings pursuant to ss.
24(1) and (2) of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms (Charter) on the basis his right under s. 11(b) of the Charter to be tried within a reasonable time has been breached.
BACKGROUND FACTS[2] The background facts are as follows:1.
The date of the alleged offence is May 17, 1996.
2.
The date of the Information is October 10, 1996 and charges that the accused ""on or about the 17th day of May, A.D. 1996 .
.
.
3.
The accused`s first appearance on the charge was January 20, 1997.
At that time he was remanded to January 24 by consent at his request, and then further remanded by consent to January 27, 1997 for a show cause hearing.
On February 11, 1997 a preliminary hearing date was set for October 27, 1997 by consent.","The farm implement dealer and the defendant entered a standard form Finance Lease Agreement which provided for an 'advance payment' and semi-annual installments with the final 'termination value' payment to be paid at the defendant's option if he elected to purchase the sprayer.
The central issue was whether the Agreement was a lease and liquidated damages should be awarded in accordance with clause two, or a conditional sales security agreement whereby the dealer was restricted to repossession and sale by s.46(2) of the Saskatchewan Farm Security Act.
HELD: The plaintiff's claim was dismissed with costs on Column 3.
1)The Agreement was a conditional sales contract whereby title was reserved until the defendant elected to make the final payment.
The transaction falls within the ambit of the Saskatchewan Farm Security Act and the dealer's right to recover the unpaid purchase price is restricted to repossession and sale.
Although the dealer framed the Agreement as a lease the Agreement itself used notions of retail financing and secured party.
Nomenclature such as principal, past due interest, conditional sales contract, purchase of equipment, and retail sales contract were used.
The construction and interpretation of the nature of the Agreement is a question of law.
The Agreement had many attributes of ownership and collectively showed that the defendant acquired a substantial interest in the sprayer.
He had possession and unrestricted right to use the sprayer with high base hours.
The total payments were equivalent to the total payments under sales contract.
The defendant had the option to acquire title by making the final payment.
He bore the risk of loss and obligation for maintenance and insurance. 2)The court could not determine whether the option price would be substantially less, equal or more than the June 2002 fair market value of the sprayer. 3)If the Agreement is lease the defendant's consent to give up possession was conditional upon his release from further liability.
Case Credit cannot foreclose the entitlement to 40 days notice and take possession of the sprayer by relying upon conditional unwritten consent.
To validate early repossession would defeat the intention of the legislation to protect creditors.
Case could take possession only in accordance with Part IV of the SFSA. 4)If the Agreement is lease and covered by the SFSA, the defendant would be released from all liability under s.55.
It would be unjust to make any further order in a summary trial without the benefit of discoveries or pre-trial conference and without evidence of the fair market value at the time of seizure.
5)If the Agreement is lease and not covered by the SFSA, it would be held that the dealer was not barred by implied acceptance of the condition the defendant be released from further liability because of the exclusionary clause.
Judgment would have been granted for $42,089 with costs on Column 3.","[1, 0, 4, 2, 5, 7, 8, 6, 9, 3, 10, 11, 15, 12, 14, 18, 16]"

She was given the standard police cautions and her rights with respect to legal counsel upon her arrest.

The plaintiffs alleged the solarium was defective, sued and obtained judgment in the Minnesota Court which it now sought to enforce in Saskatchewan.
The defendant argued the Minnesota court did not have jurisdiction because at the time the action was commenced he was not 'ordinarily resident' in the state of Minnesota.
The defendant was served in Saskatoon with notice of the claim but did not appear or defend the action or surrender to its jurisdiction.
HELD: The action was dismissed with costs to be taxed.
1)The defences available to defendant in Saskatchewan where an action is brought to enforce foreign judgment are set out in s.6 of the Foreign Judgments Act.
2)While there may be evidence supporting the conclusion that the defendant was carrying on business in Minnesota, that same evidence does not support the conclusion the defendant was ordinarily resident there.
The defendant advertised its business in Minnesota and elsewhere in the United States and employed agents there to sell its product.
The logical conclusion was that the address in the city of Minneapolis was a business address.
It could be argued that the defendant carried on business in the state of Minnesota but the question was whether the defendant was ordinarily resident in that state.
The Foreign Judgments Act reflects real difference in the meaning of 'ordinarily resident' and 'carrying on business'.","[1, 0, 5, 2, 6, 12, 4, 14, 9, 11, 16, 21, 13, 20, 18, 17, 22, 3]"

The defendant opposes the application and requests a summary trial.
[2] Rule 488 sets out the test for summary judgment.
[3] The foregoing rule, by its use of the words “... shall grant judgment unless ...” requires the presiding judge to grant judgment except in those circumstances outlined in s. 488(a) and (b).

Q.B.)
per Klebuc J. at p. 757-59 with respect to granting judgment pursuant to the summary judgment Rules, the basic question is whether there is a genuine need for the trial of an action.
As with the summary judgment rules, the defendant bears the burden of demonstrating there is a genuine need for a trial.
(Kostuchuk v. Bombardier Credit Ltd., supra per Cameron J.A.
The analogy is the law related to the striking of a pleading for disclosing no reasonable cause of action or defence (Rule 173(a)) where the Court must assume any allegation of fact to be true.
Such is the case in this matter.","Accused charged with impaired driving, being over.08 and driving while disqualified.
The charges arose out of an incident where he rear-ended car stopped in front of him at red light.
The accident victim estimated the time of the accident to be around 1:30 a.m.
After the accident, the victim, witnesses and attending police officers noticed that the accused displayed signs of intoxication.
The police arrived at the scene at 2:12 a.m.
The accused was seated in the police car and was first spoken to shortly before 3:00 a.m.
The officer determined through CPIC that the accused was prohibited from driving in Saskatchewan.
The demand for breath sample was made at 2:48 a.m.
At 2:50 a.m. he was given his rights and he spoke to lawyer prior to providing sample.
HELD: The evidence of the crown witnesses was accepted over that of the defendant.
The Court found beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant was the operator of the vehicle when the collision occurred and therefore the accused was found guilty of driving while disqualified.
The crown was not able to prove beyond a reasonable doubt the time of the accident and, therefore, is not entitled to rely upon the presumption provided in s.258(1) of the Code.
The Court was not able to conclude that the first sample was taken within 2 hours of the incident.
On the charge of impaired driving, the Court had no doubt that the accused's ability to operate a motor vehicle was impaired by alcohol.
The Court also held that there was no breach of fundamental justice by virtue of the discussion of the police witnesses with the civilian witnesses during the trial.
When witness remains in the courtroom after an exclusion order and then testifies, the trial judge may consider this in deciding the weight to be given to the evidence of that witness.
This principle is equally applicable to the case at hand where witnesses who had yet to testify discussed the evidence with other witnesses after their testimony.
The Court rejected the defence argument that there was an appearance of unfairness about the trial process that requires that a stay of proceedings to be entered.
The Court held that there must be manifest unfairness in the trial process as a result of the impugned behaviour in order to find a breach of fundamental justice.
Here the impugned conduct only affects the weight to be given to the evidence of the police officers.
The conversation complained of took place outside of the courtroom at trial and was not material to the outcome of the trial or the charges.
There was no tailoring of the evidence as consequence of the discussion.
Even if the Court had found breach of fundamental justice, stay would not be appropriate.
After the conversation was discovered, it was reported to the Court and the trial was adjourned to permit full disclosure of the impugned conversation and to give counsel an opportunity to prepare in light of the development.
stay is to be entered only in the clearest of cases.
Here the right of the defendant to a fair trial has not been prejudiced by the introduction of evidence as the Court was able to assess the weight to be given to the officers' evidence.
The Charter application for a stay of proceedings alleging a breach of fundamental justice is denied.","[0, 1, 2, 6, 5, 11, 10, 12, 3, 9, 14, 15, 8, 16, 18, 13, 19, 24, 22]"

(orally)[1] The appellant wife appeals the decision of the chambers judge varying the amount of child support and reducing the amount of arrears.
She contends that the chambers judge erred in varying the order for maintenance and reducing the amount of arrears in the absence of evidence that there was a change in the conditions, means and needs of the respondent or the children as contemplated by s. 17(4) of the Divorce Act.
[1][2] The respondent contends that the amount of child support should be reduced by reason of his reduced income caused by his unemployment or reduced employment over the last four years.
The appellant argues that the respondent has failed to satisfactorily explain his unemployment.","The accused was charged with four offences relating to a twelve year old girl, including sexual assault and uttering a threat.
He was released on bail with a surety.
The accused is paraplegic.
He moved to British Columbia after his release.
He did not appear for trial, and a Canada wide warrant was issued for his arrest.
He was arrested and returned to stand trial.
The Crown applied to have bail and the surety forfeited.
It took the position that the accused had deliberately left the province to avoid trial, and therefore should be responsible for the full $1,000.
It also contended that the sureties had a responsibility to ensure the accused's attendance at trial, and that they should also be responsible for the full $1,000.
The surety testified that the conditions of the recognizance were not explained to him, and he did not understand the potential consequences of default.
Dismissing the applications for forfeiture,
that the surety had no concept of his obligations under the recognizance, and was not made aware of those obligations by the authorities.
In these circumstances, it would not be just to order forfeiture.
With respect to the accused, he is impecunious.
His failure to pay any amount ordered against him could lead to imprisonment.
As the accused already faces the prospect of imprisonment for failing to attend trial, this would create the potential of double liability for what is in essence the same offence.","[1, 3, 2, 0, 5, 4, 6]"

Following the conviction of the respondent on a charge of trafficking in morphine contrary to section 5(1) of the Controlled Drugs and Substances Act, the prosecutor asked the sentencing judge to make a DNA order under section 487.051(3) of the Criminal Code.
The judge declined to do so for the reason this was the respondent’s first drug offence and she had no record of violence.
With respect, we are of the opinion the judge erred in declining to make the order.
The error lay in the judge’s failure to have regard for the offender’s record as a whole—she has 53 prior convictions—and to have adequate regard for the objectives of section 487.051 as identified in R. v. Briggs (2001), 2001 CanLII 24113 (ON CA), 45 C.R.

Two children were born of the relationship; the parties owned home as well as other assets.
They separated in 1995.
The appellant brought an application under s. 275 of the Matrimonial Property Act seeking an equal division of assets.
She also sought a declaration that the Charter is infringed by the definition of spouse in s. 2(g) of the Act, because it does not include or recognize her common law relationship.
The Chambers judge dismissed the application.
He found that marital status is not an analogous ground upon which to base claim of discrimination under s. 15(1) of the Charter; or, in the alternative, that s. 2(g) does not constitute discrimination under s. 15(1) of the Charter; or, in the further alternative, that if s. 2(g) is discriminatory, it is saved by s. of the Charter.
Allowing the appeal,
that marital status is an analogous ground, and that s. 2(g) is discriminatory under s. 15 of the Charter because it denies a person in a common law relationship benefits which are granted to a similar person in a marriage relationship.
The Crown did not discharge its onus of proving that the discrimination is demonstrably justified in a free and democratic society.
The court rejected the appellant's submission that common law should be read in to the Act, and instead declared s. 2(g) to be unconstitutional and of no force and effect.
This declaration was suspended for 12 months to enable the legislature to devise new criteria for eligibility under the Act that do not infringe s. 15(1) of the Charter.","[0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7]"

Guardian agreed it had an obligation to defend but submitted that Royal also had a duty to defend in the name and on behalf of the insured.
As a result of the differences between the insurers, Guardian made the application for directions to determine whether Royal had an obligation to defend.

She was found not guilty of trafficking and possession of marijuana for the purpose of trafficking.
The driver was found guilty of possession for the purpose of trafficking.
The trafficking charge against him was judicially stayed.
HELD: An order of forfeiture issued pursuant to s.16(1).
The application for relief was dismissed.
1)It was not necessary to address the Charter submissions with respect to s.19(3) because Crown counsel consented to the respondent's application being viewed as an application for relief from forfeiture under s.20.
2)It was impossible to conclude the respondent 'appeared innocent of any complicity' in the offence for which the driver was convicted and that she 'exercised all reasonable care to be satisfied' that the Lincoln was not likely to be used in the commission of the offence.
3)Section 11 of the Charter applies only when person has been charged with an offence.
There was no charge against the respondent at this time. 4)The Act distinguishes between three types of persons who might own, or have an interest in, conveyance which is 'offence-related property': the interest of person convicted of the offence is forfeitable pursuant to s.16(1); if the person has been neither convicted nor charged and appears innocent of any complicity in the offence; someone charged with the offence which gave rise to the forfeiture application (as here).
The forfeiture is not, except with respect to an offender, arbitrary.
In view of the provisions available under the Act to obtain relief from forfeiture it cannot be concluded that empowering a court to grant an order of forfeiture constitutes cruel or unusual punishment.","[3, 15, 4, 1, 12, 16, 24, 19, 5, 20, 6, 11, 25, 13]"

This is an appeal from an assessment of damages in a wrongful dismissal action brought against Saskatchewan Transportation Company by Leo Larsen, its former President and Chief Executive Officer.
Saskatchewan Transportation Company, or STC as it is commonly known, is a provincial Crown corporation.
It admitted to dismissing Mr. Larsen without cause or notice, in breach of its contract of service with him.
In consequence Mr. Larsen obtained a judgment for damages against the corporation in the basic amount of $165,000, an amount it contends is exorbitant.
For the most part we can find no tenable basis for concluding that the award of damages was inordinately high.
STC took issue with these premises, contending the trial judge had erred in relation to each of them.
(i) The salary.
We do not agree, as STC suggests, that Mr. Larsen's loss of income should have been calculated on the premise his annual salary was $102,000, not $110,000.","The mother had custody of the 12 and year olds under the terms of the January 10, 2000 consent judgment.

The onus is on the applicant to provide cogent, independent or objective verification of change of circumstances.
This application was brought 10 months after the pre-trial conference.
It was of no consequence that someone may come into the home rather than using commercial day care service.
There was no change in the father's hours of work or the schedule.
The only change was that the mother was no longer available to provide care during Saturday of his access weekends.
The mother was not to schedule activities during the father's access periods without his consent and he was to provide 7 days written notice if he chooses not to exercise access during specified times.
This was not a variation of the custody/access regime but rather specific directions to provide some predictability for the children.","[1, 2, 6, 8, 4, 7, 11, 12, 5, 13, 3]"

The claim of the Michaluks is for $58,720.34.
This sum represents amounts outstanding on a failed agreement and lease of the Michaluk's property in Manitoba to the bankrupt.
The claims of these two creditors represent the vast majority of claims of unsecured creditors in this bankruptcy.
The bankrupt's position is that the bulk of the debt was incurred as a result of the failure of his former business, Red Bull Enterprises Ltd.
He contends that the failure was caused by a protracted dispute with the Department of Highways over the right of Red Bull to occupy land owned by Highways.
The bankrupt claims that the business failure combined with pressure from creditors such as the Michaluk's caused him to look at bankruptcy as the only alternative.
The date of the assignment was December 19, 1995.
The causes of bankruptcy as set out in the Section 170(1) report are ""Failure of business.
Unable to meet financial obligations.
Directors obligations.
Pressure of creditors.""
Counsel for the bankrupt raised two preliminary issues which I will deal with in turn.
Counsel for the bankrupt contends that Section 241 of the Income Tax Act prohibits disclosure of this information.","The plaintiff sought damages for personal injuries to her lower back, right knee and left ankle sustained when she slipped and fell while grocery shopping in March 2000.
The defendant acknowledged the plaintiff fell in its produce department, but did not concede the water on the floor caused her to slip; the cause was, in part, her worn running shoes without laces.
Liability and degree of personal injury were in issue.
The claim proceeded under the simplified procedure under Part Forty of the Queen's Bench Rules.
HELD: The claim was dismissed with costs.
1)The defendant had a duty of care to the plaintiff as owner and occupier.
The courts have most often based the duty of care on the invitor/invitee standard.
Maxay v. Ramsay Drugs proposed four-part inquiry to determine whether or not an occupier has breached its duty of care.
2)The plaintiff established on a balance of probabilities that she slipped because of water on the floor.
The evidence did not support an inference that her footwear caused the slip or was a contributing factor.
3)An adverse inference was not drawn from the defendant's failure to adduce evidence confirming its employee had in fact cleaned the floor.
The employee was no longer employed by the defendant.
Neither party was able to locate him.
4)Some of her injuries were, in part, the aggravation of pre-existing conditions.
The most significant injury was sprain to her left ankle, which had not been resolved primarily because the plaintiff declined to accept available treatment and failed to follow medical advice.
The inconsistencies in her affidavit and the physician notes or medical reports respecting her injuries and treatment were not relevant to this decision.
5)A 'sweep log' was kept for each department and employees made regular inspections of the sales floor area in every department.
The plaintiff slipped and fell about an hour after the last sweeping.
A regular program of maintenance was conducted in the area.
The overall policies and practices of regular maintenance and responsibility of each employee were substantially the same if not identical to those considered in the Mollenhauer and Libel group of cases.
The defendant met the legal standard of care imposed in the circumstances and was not liable for the plaintiff's injuries.
To find otherwise would be to impose a standard that is inconsistent with that previously imposed by this court in almost identical circumstances.","[0, 1, 2, 7, 6, 5, 13, 8, 17, 14, 12, 15, 16, 11, 9, 19]"

Brown for the applicant SGI Blair P. Bleakney for City of SaskatoonFIAT ACTON J. August 1, 2012 [1] This is an application by Saskatchewan Government Insurance on behalf of the defendant for an order pursuant to Rule 107A(c) of The Queen’s Bench Rules and s. 7 of The Contributory Negligence Act, R.S.S.
1978, c. C-31, granting leave to the defendant, William J. Schmidt, to add the City of Saskatoon as a third party to this action.

20 v. Dunmac General Contractors Ltd., 2002 SKQB 404 (CanLII), [2002] S.J.","The appellant appealed his conviction for dangerous driving (Criminal Code s.249(1)(a)) and sentence of a $1,200 fine, $180 surcharge, and 18 month driving prohibition.
In issue was whether the evidence found by the trial judge established both the mens rea and actus reus beyond a reasonable doubt.
The sentence appeal was brought on the ground it did not take into account mitigating circumstances, case law or sentencing principles.
HELD: The appeal against conviction was dismissed.
The driving prohibition was reduced to 9 months.
The fine and surcharge were confirmed.
1)By applying the wrong standard, the trial judge committed an error of law, but no miscarriage of justice occurred.
When the correct standard, as enunciated in Hundal, is applied to the evidence as found by the trial judge, the conviction was appropriate.
2)The application of the Stellato principle to a charge of dangerous driving under s.249(1) was an error in law.
The conclusion that the Crown need only establish proof of any degree of impairment and not a marked departure from normal behaviour does not apply to a charge under s.249.
Simple judgmental errors in routine driving do not constitute conduct amounting to a marked departure from the standard of care required.
Mere negligence or driving without due care and attention are not sufficient.
3)The accused's evidence did not address how fast he was going (he stated his speedometer was not working) nor over what route or the time of the chase.
There was ample evidence on those issues from the two Crown witnesses.
4)The findings of fact established the appellant's driving conduct did amount to a marked departure from the standard of care a reasonable person would exercise in those circumstances.
The test is whether a reasonably prudent driver in the circumstances ought to have been aware of the risk and of the danger involved in his driving conduct.
The accused engaged in a planned and deliberate course of conduct when he gave chase and continued over a significant distance at a high speed at night with children and other pedestrians in the vicinity.
It was not necessary for the Crown to establish the collision caused significant damage or that a collision occurred at all.
The acceptance of the accused's assertion that the collision was inadvertent did not mean the Crown failed to prove the necessary mens rea.
5)An 18 month prohibition was excessive.
The conduct was at the low end of the continuum.
He was employed as a truck driver and relied on his operator's licence to earn a living.
He chased the other vehicle because he believed its occupants stole tapes from his vehicle.
Although he was convicted for refusal to provide breath samples 2 years ago, alcohol was not a factor here.","[0, 1, 4, 8, 2, 3, 11, 6, 10, 13, 9]"

(orally)[1] This appeal is from an order made by a Queen’s Bench judge prohibiting McMurtry P.C.J.
from continuing as trial judge in respect of criminal charges against the respondent Herzberg.
[2] Herzberg was charged with impaired driving, driving with a blood-alcohol level exceeding .08, and dangerous driving.
He moved for a stay of proceedings on the ground that the Crown had failed to provide adequate disclosure.
In response, the Crown filed an affidavit to show that disclosure had been made.
The affidavit had appended as exhibits the items disclosed, among them, a copy of the criminal record of Mr. Herzberg.
The application was dismissed.
[3] At the opening of the trial, the defence applied for a stay on the ground of perception of bias on the part of the judge because the respondent’s criminal record was before her.
[4] The respondent then applied to the Queen’s Bench for an order of prohibition.
Crown counsel contends that the trial had not commenced as no evidence had been called and therefore it could not be said the criminal record was put into evidence at trial.","The applicant operated commercial private billiards club with liquor licence and served bar food.
The applicant applied to amend the liquor licence to another category to allow public access and slightly longer hours of operation.

The applicant applied for an order declaring that the land use by-law permitted the proposed use.
Application granted;
the proposal did not constitute a change in use as the essential use of the premises was the sale of liquor and food in a pool hall and that would not change.
There was no evidence that the proposal would result in a nuisance or increased traffic, neither of which could be presumed.","[2, 3, 0, 5, 6, 4, 9, 8, 7, 11, 13]"
970,"JUDGMENTINTRODUCTION[1] Marjorie Hanson applies for relief pursuant to The Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms (“the Charter”) on the basis of post-charge delay denying her the right to have her trial in a reasonable time.
I find that there was a Charter breach and that the appropriate remedy is a stay of proceedings.
My reasons follow.
CHARGE[2] The accused is charged that: on or about May 18, 2004, at Buffalo Narrows, Saskatchewan, she did: Count 1 - unlawfully produce Cannabis Marihuana contrary to Section 7 of the Controlled Drugs and Substances Act (“the CDSA”) and Count 2 - unlawfully possess Cannabis Marihuana in an amount not exceeding three kilograms for the purpose of trafficking contrary to Section 5(2) of the CDSA.
HISTORY OF PROCEEDINGS[3] The following dates are relevant to this application: (a) May 19, 2004 - the Information was sworn charging the accused; (b) May 19, 2004 - the accused first appeared in court with Legal Aid as her counsel, was released on an Undertaking Given to a Judge subject to a number of restrictive conditions, and the Information was adjourned to September 8, 2004 for disclosure; (b.1) August 24, 2004 - the defence forwarded a Consent Order to the Crown authorizing opening of a sealed Search Warrant and Information to Obtain, the edited copy of which was provided on November 2, 2004, only after counsel for the co-accused consented to the Order in late October 2004; (c) September 8, 2004 - the Information was adjourned to October 6, 2004, and then to November 3, 2004, for defence election on Count 2; (d) November 3, 2004 - defence election of Queen’s Bench Judge Alone made and then the Information was adjourned by the defence to November 17, 2004, then to December 8, 2004, then to February 23, 2005 (on which date a reelection was made on Count 2 to Provincial Court), and then to March 9, 2005, in each case to be spoken to; (e) March 9, 2005 - a not guilty plea was entered and the trial was set for September 28, 2005; (f) September 28, 2005 - the Information was adjourned at defence request to October 19, 2005, then to October 26, 2005, then to November 19, 2005, and then to December 14, 2005, in each case to be spoken to; (g) December 14, 2005 - a new trial date was set for June 14, 2006; (h) June 14, 2006 - the trial was adjourned to November 29, 2006 at Crown request, the Accused not waiving delay; (i) November 29, 2006 - the trial was adjourned at Crown request due to the inability of some Crown witnesses able to travel to Buffalo Narrows in the bad weather, a new trial date being set for January 19, 2007, the defence not waiving delay; (i.1) December 13, 2006 - Charter motion argued and decision reserved to this date.
[6] The onus is on the accused to prove the breach on a balance of probabilities.","The police observed the appellant's vehicle rub another vehicle and followed him to where he parked without difficulty.
While taking the appellant to where the incident occurred, the officer noted slight smell of alcohol and bloodshot eyes.
The appellant failed the ALERT test and refused the breathalyzer.
The refusal charge was dismissed and the appellant was convicted of impaired driving.
The appellant appealed.
Appeal allowed; conviction quashed.
The evidence of impairment was too weak to convict the appellant.
The officer told the accused that if he passed the ALERT test, he would be sent on his way.
Thus, she must not have thought that the appellant's ability to operate a motor vehicle was impaired.
Failure to act cannot be considered by the trial judge as part of the reasonable and probable grounds.","[2, 1, 3, 4, 9, 5]"
971,"INTRODUCTION [1] Todd Tyndall is charged with driving without due care and attention at Yorkton, Saskatchewan on February 18, 2004, contrary to section 44(1) of the Highway Traffic Act.
Section 44(1) provides “no person shall drive a vehicle on a highway without due care and attention”.
This offence is in effect careless driving, as distinguished from dangerous driving under the Criminal Code.
[2] At trial, the Crown called three witnesses: Rebecca Banga, Justin Banga and Lance Kuchar.
The defence then called four witnesses: Michael Rostotski, Corporal Pelzer, Constable Kinellson and Mr. Tyndall.
[3] On this date, Mr. Tyndall, who is a Constable with the Royal Canadian Mounted Police stationed in Yorkton, was on duty in a marked police car.
With him was an authorized “ride-along” passenger named Michael Rostotski.
While driving south on the road that passes beside Tim Horton’s restaurant, Mr. Tyndall received a radio message asking him to assist another officer on a “non-priority” matter in the south-west part of Yorkton.
[4] As he drove his vehicle down the road past Super Store on his right, with the parking lot on his left, Mr. Tyndall stopped his vehicle, and backed up to where Justin Banga and Rebecca Banga were standing with their infant girl.
[5] The issue to be determined is whether Mr. Tyndall’s actions in operating his vehicle on the road beside Super Store constituted driving without due care and attention.","The accused was charged with owning a dog that without provocation attacked a person contrary to the Urban Municipality Act s.135.3(3).
There were four separate incidents involving the dog in September 2001.
At issue was whether the Crown had proven an attack on any of the four occasions.
The accused agreed that the presumption of non-provocation set out in s.135.2(1) of the UMA applied and that presumption had not been displaced.
HELD: 1)A $200 fine was imposed along with conditions.
The dog must be kept within an enclosed continuous fence and chained to a post.
There must be a gate preventing exiting except while on a leash and muzzled.
The owner must display a sign stating Guard Dog on Duty.
2)If dog is territorial or protective, and the facts show the human has, by intruding, been in law provocative, the offence may not be proven beyond reasonable doubt.
On the evidence there was no intrusion sufficient to justify an attack or which could be considered provocation.
3)There were seven specific pieces of evidence which supported the conclusion that the owner did not take reasonable steps to ensure his dog did not attack someone in the fashion prohibited by s.135.3(3).
It is irrelevant at law that after dog attacks it responds to its owner's commands.
The dog escaped the yard, was off leash and was not sufficiently restrained or enclosed.
logging chain affixed to post is substantial way of tethering dog.
One would not expect dog to be attached to logging chain if there were no concerns.","[2, 3, 6, 1, 4, 7, 5, 12, 8, 10]"

The trustee had tried to sell the real property for year.
HELD: The vesting order was granted.
1)Although the Court tentatively concluded that s.109 of the new Land Tittles Act, 2000 combined with Queen's Bench Act ss.12 and 65 are not sufficient authority to support the granting of a vesting order in the circumstances, the Court was now satisfied that Regulation 6.5 of the Land Titles Conversion Facilitation Regulation to the new Act does so.
In substance the regulation parallels the nature, extent, purpose and intent served by the vesting order provisions contained in the former s.87.
2)This was an appropriate case to grant a vesting order in the absence of adverse interests or any interest in the registered owner or any subsequent encumbrancer or other creditor.
The bank's indebtedness secured by its mortgage far exceeded the purchase price.
The registered owner had taken no opposition.
No other interests will be adversely affected.

974,"This case concerns another young offender who stole cars in Regina in the summer of 1994.
J.M.
pled guilty to 16 counts of auto theft, one count of possession of a stolen auto and one count of dangerous driving.
The Crown appeals the disposition arguing it is not fit having regard for the number of offences and the need to maintain the public's confidence in the administration of justice.
Several features appear in this case which did not appear in R. v. B.
(S.) et al.
The first new issue is that, in addition to the large number of theft offences, J.M.
used a stolen vehicle in a high speed chase with the police resulting in extensive damage to the vehicle.
(This incident occurred after his period of co-operation with the police.)
A second new issue is the extent to which the Court should be influenced by disparity in dispositions among young offenders.
This is raised because J.M.

At his first court appearance the defendant requested the first available trial date and there was no evidence to suggest that an institutional delay of 13 months was the norm in other metro provincial courts.
Given the nature of the charges, the technical nature of breathalyzer law and the defendant's stated intention to raise ss. 8 and 9 of the Charter, prejudice could be inferred on the basis that the length of delay was likely to interfere with the quality of evidence tendered.","[3, 7, 2, 4, 8, 9, 10, 11, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 12, 6, 19]"

On June 1, 1999 Mr. Cote was committed to stand trial on one of the fraud charges.
He now applies to this court for a remedy pursuant to s. 24 of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms.
The application is based primarily on Mr. Cote’s position that he has been denied the right to be tried on the fraud charge within a reasonable time.

The parties agree that just over 22 months will have passed between the laying of the fraud charge and the scheduled trial date of February 28, 2000.

S. Loewen, for the defence.
JUDGMENT Goliath Prov.
Ct. J. August 28, 1998 1 GOLIATH PROV.
CT. J.:- Lee Zoerb is charged with an assault causing bodily harm to Jason Baikie.
The charge arises out of an altercation which occurred at Uncle Charlie's Bar December 14, 1997, in which Baikie suffered significant injuries about the head and face.
The events surrounding the altercation were described by three Crown witnesses, and by five defence witnesses including the accused.
As is usually the case, there are discrepancies.
The accused admits that he threw a punch but says that Baikie struck him first.
He also says that he does not think that he caused Baikie's injuries.
The patron happened to be a penitentiary employee, and it is suggested by the defence that his co-workers were out to ""get"" the accused or to exact some manner of revenge.
His remarks made to Mr. Green in the washroom prior to the alleged assault support the defence's theory that he may indeed provoked the incident.
The accused was employed by Uncle Charlie's as a doorman and relief bartender.","The accused applies for relief pursuant to the Charter of Rights on the basis of post-charge delay denying him the right to have his trial in a reasonable time.
The accused was charged on July 3, 2003 with common assault contrary to s. 266 of the Criminal Code, threatening to use weapon contrary to s. 267(a) of the Code, and destroying property of value less than $5,000 contrary to s. 430(4) of the Code.
On July 31, 2003, the accused first appeared in court.
The information was adjourned until October 6, 2003 due to lack of Legal Aid resources.
On November 3, 2003, not guilty plea was entered and trial was set for May 6, 2004.
On May 6, 2004, the trial was adjourned on application by the Crown due to the non-attendance of the complainant and new trial date was set for October 7, 2004.
HELD: There was no Charter breach and the application is dismissed.
1) The length of delay from the date of release to the date of trial is approximately 15 months.
This is not a complicated case and the delay warrants an inquiry.
2) The Court did not accept the accused's submission that he suffered actual prejudice because the undertaking prevented him from accessing his children.
There were no efforts by the accused to overcome this.
3) The restrictive condition in the undertakings prohibiting him from drinking alcohol has resulted in him being charged with and pleading guilty to offences of breaching his undertaking.
As these offences all occurred within what could be considered a reasonable time for the matter to proceed to trial, there is no actual prejudice to the accused.
3) This is a charge that involves an offence of domestic violence and is so serious that it carries the heightened public interest that exists in offences of violence.","[2, 3, 0, 5, 9, 4, 1, 6, 7, 10, 8, 12, 14, 17]"

The issue was whether the evidence was sufficient to prove impairment beyond a reasonable doubt.
HELD: The only reliable indicia of impairment were a very strong odour of alcohol and a flushed face.
Beyond that, the indicators are either inconclusive, non-existent or the accused offered a reasonable explanation for them.
The evidence is so frail as to leave a reasonable doubt as to impairment and the accused was acquitted.
1) The accused was exceeding the speed limit and failed to signal lane changes.
His vehicle wandered somewhat in the lane, but did not stray into the other lane.
The observations of his driving were made over 2-minute period.
The aspects of the driving that were observed may have been the result of driver inattention. 2)
The bloodshot eyes may have been the result of chain smoking.
Further, the evidence of glazed eyes is inconclusive in the absence of reliable evidence of bloodshot eyes.
3) The evidence of flushed face was reliable evidence of impairment. 4)
The evidence of strong odour of alcohol is reliable indicia of impairment, due to the consumption of alcohol by the accused. 5)
The accused did not have any problem with balance, but was moving in slow and deliberate manner.
If the accused was not displaying difficulty with balance and coordination, then the suggestion that he was moving slowly is not a credible indicator of impairment.
The accused did not display slurred speech and appeared to comprehend his legal rights and obligations.
He did not display any mental confusion or inappropriate behaviour.
In the absence of expert evidence to explain the scientific basis for the physical tests administered, the proper method of application and their reliability the Court could not rely on them.
6) The accused blew 80 milligrams on two occasions.
However, regardless of the alcohol consumption and the accused blood alcohol concentration, the only reliable indicia of impairment were a strong odour of alcohol and a flushed face.","[1, 3, 2, 4, 0, 6, 20, 10, 28, 14, 21, 19, 24, 23, 30, 25, 36, 27, 38, 18, 22]"

It became clear that the main issues on the appeal were the duty to accommodate and the alleged resignation of the respondent.
The respondent filed a complaint under Part II of the Code alleging that CUPE and the City discriminated against him on the basis of his disability.
The Commission substantiated this allegation before the Tribunal by showing there was a discriminatory impact on the respondent as a result of the seniority system established by the collective agreements in force from time to time between the City and CUPE.
The Tribunal found that all of the efforts made in response to the respondent did not deal directly and effectively with his claim that the seniority standards in the collective agreement were discriminatory towards him on the basis of his disability.
The Tribunal agreed with the Commission that their efforts were too little too late to reverse the systemic discrimination.
The accommodations did not meet the duty to accommodate short of undue hardship.
The Tribunal found that the City and CUPE contravened s. 16 and s. 18(1) of the Code by discriminating against the respondent on the basis of his disability.
HELD: The appeals by the City and CUPE on liability are dismissed.
The parties were allowed to refer the issue of damages to the Tribunal.
1) The superior expertise of human rights tribunal is confined to fact finding and decision making in the context of human rights and therefore reasonableness is the test for judicial review.
If the issue is one of law, the standard of review is one of correctness.
In other words, the appropriate standard of review by superior court of factual determination is whether the decision is patently unreasonable.
Where human rights commission is required to interpret laws of general application, the correctness test applies.
2) The Court agreed with the Commission that the seniority system prevented a person such as the respondent from ever getting a permanent position, without accommodation, by giving priority to all those who could work more hours or gain permanent status by being flexible enough to work at the wide range of positions that the City had to offer.
The respondent could not take advantage of this reward system because he could only bid into truck driver positions.
The City and CUPE were too late in developing the plan.
The plan was conceived in early 1999 to be executed when the respondent reached the top of the seniority list, probably in about 2000.
But by this time, he was unable to work.
3) The characterization of the order of the Tribunal is not to direct the respondent be given a permanent position despite the seniority rights of others.
It is to give him the benefits he would have had if his seniority had accrued in a non-discriminatory manner.
4) Whether CUPE had knowledge of the problem is irrelevant.
The breach occurs as soon as there is discrimination.
The City and CUPE are jointly responsible where a collective bargaining agreement that they negotiated is discriminatory.
5) For either the City or CUPE to avoid liability they must discharge their duty to accommodate up to the point of undue hardship.
6) The Tribunal's finding that there was no undue hardship is supported by the evidence.
There are approximately 1,400 casual and permanent positions.
Moving the respondent up the seniority list would have relegated certain union members in a large bargaining unit by one, which is insignificant.
If this occurred, although the respondent would obtain the next permanent position, this would not be in disregard of the rights of other employees.
Neither the City nor CUPE presented any evidence that would establish that a retroactive adjustment itself would create an undue hardship in the context that it would cause the seniority list to become unmanageable or ambiguous.
It is not without significance that even if the membership of CUPE opposed the placing of the respondent into a permanent position, this by itself does not justify a finding of undue hardship.
7) The mandate of the Tribunal, once a finding of discrimination is made, is to determine what losses are caused by the discriminatory conduct.
The Tribunal found that the respondent's resignation was one effect of the discrimination.
The Court found there was no merit to this ground of appeal.","[1, 0, 4, 3, 7, 8, 9, 5, 6, 10, 11, 13, 15]"

[1] This appeal from a spousal support order was allowed orally from the bench for the reasons herein set out.
[2] On May 21, 2008, Ottenbreit J., as he then was, issued a judgment after trial in relation to a petition by the respondent for a division of matrimonial property and spousal maintenance.
(2008 SKQB 222 (CanLII)) The parties had separated in 2003 after 24 years of marriage following two years of cohabitation.
At the time of the judgment, the appellant was 60 years old and the respondent was 53.
These children had continued to live with the appellant after the parties’ separation and the younger, Catherine, was a full time student.
The appellant had assumed a substantial portion of her support.
[3] Both parties had some health problems.","The accused was charged with aggravated assault contrary to s. 268 of the Criminal Code; assault causing bodily harm contrary to s. 267(b) of the Code; dangerous driving contrary to s. 249(1)(a) of the Code; and two counts of assault contrary to s. 266(a) of the Code.
HELD: 1) On the charge that the accused endangered the life of the complainant by attempting to strike her with a motor vehicle, the Court had strong suspicions that the accused did intend to strike the complainant with the vehicle but could not convict.
2) There was no doubt that bodily harm was caused to the complainant.
The accused admits he slung her on the ground and kicked her and, as a result,
the court find the accused guilty of assault causing bodily harm.
3) There is no doubt that the accused was operating a truck and that he drove it toward the complainant, who was lying on the concrete, and her daughter.
It is unnecessary for the Crown to prove that the lives or safety of others were actually endangered.
The offence is proved where the Crown establishes that the driving complained of was dangerous to the public.
The offence requires a marked departure from prudent conduct.
The offence of dangerous driving was established and the accused was found guilty.
4) The accused was found guilty of two counts of assault.","[1, 3, 6, 5, 9, 0, 4, 8, 10, 2]"

Mr. Cretu is Roma and a Romanian national who has resided in Canada since his arrival here exactly eight years ago.
Romania seeks Mr. Cretu’s extradition from Canada so that he might serve a three-year prison sentence imposed as a result of his conviction, in that country, for criminally negligent homicide (an offence equivalent to that of manslaughter in Canada).
Romania is represented in this proceeding by the Attorney General for Canada.
[2] The factual background to this application is as follows.
He was later apprehended and he admitted consuming alcohol and striking the victim.
Romania charged him with criminally negligent homicide and leaving the scene of an accident.","FIAT: This is an application to set aside a noting for default and the resulting default judgment.
The main ground of the application is that the service of the statement of claim on the defendant did not comply with Rule 19(1) of The Queen's Bench Rules.
HELD: The application is dismissed and the service upon the defendant by registered mail is validated.
1) Rule 19(1) of the Rules must be read in conjunction with Rule 18.
2) Queen's Bench Rule 18 is new rule and came into effect in December 2002.
No authorities were available that considered its provisions.
3) Rule 18 requires the defendant to satisfy the court that he has not received notice of the document.

At the conclusion of trial, counsel requested that I reserve on the matter of costs.
It is now clear that the applicant intended to make a submission for award of solicitor and client costs of approximately $70,000.
Evidence was led at trial about insubstantial offers made directly between the parties.
The further evidence now shows, in fact, that substantial offers were made through counsel, although that evidence was not before the Court at trial.
The applicant submits that the judgment in that particular requires amendment since there was no evidence before the Court at trial about substantive offers made by counsel for the parties.

[2] The respondent is 38 years old with 49 prior convictions.","The accused is charged with committing a sexual assault contrary to s. 271 of the Criminal Code.
The accused was police officer with the Regina Police Service for 25 years until he retired in 1999 with the rank of Deputy Chief of Police.
In the fall of 2001, he was appointed Justice of the Peace.
The Crown proceeded summarily.
The first incident involved the accused bringing the complainant's hand to his crotch.
The second incident involved the accused touching the complainant's breast and crotch and trying to kiss her.
The issues are whether the Crown proved the actus reus and mens rea of the offence.
HELD: The accused is guilty of sexually assaulting the complainant in both courtroom 10 and the Youth Court general office.
1) The alleged touching occurred and it was of a sexual nature.
The complainant did not consent to the contact.
2) The parties, along with most of the employees in the building, were often subject to or the source of numerous crude jokes and comments of a sexual nature.
The accused believed that his discussions with the complainant about such matters were serious.
However, at no time did the accused express his desire to get to know her or to see her outside of the workplace.
He did not raise the possibility of physical relationship nor did she express any interest in sexual liaison.
When he suggested it, she was not enthusiastic.
The interactions described by the accused are more consistent with normal interaction between persons in that particular workplace than with an indication of consent to sexual activity.
Looking at all the evidence, there is nothing to support an honest belief on the part of the accused that the complainant consented to the sexual contact.
The accused's suggestion that he had an honest but mistaken belief in consent cannot be considered because the Court could not cobble together from the totality of the evidence sufficient evidence from which it could be said that the accused could have drawn an honestly held belief or from which he could have honestly inferred that the complainant had consented to his touching her.","[1, 0, 2, 5, 3, 4]"

Carlson for Her Majesty the QueenR.A. Nordal for Marcelle Daphne BrooksJUDGMENT MATHESON J. November 14, 2000[1] On September 8, 1999, a black Lincoln Town Car was stopped by a member of the R.C.M.Police on highway No.
1 near Maple Creek, Saskatchewan; 28.3 pounds of marihuana was discovered in the trunk of the Lincoln.
[2] The driver of the Lincoln was Randall Wesley Fair (""Fair"").
The registered owner of the Lincoln — Marcelle Daphne Brooks (""Brooks"") — was in the front passenger seat.
Both individuals were charged with trafficking in marihuana and possession of marihuana for the purpose of trafficking.
Fair was found guilty of possession of marihuana for the purpose of trafficking.
The other charge against him was judicially stayed.
Brooks was found not guilty on both counts.
Prima facie, then, Her Majesty is entitled to an order of forfeiture pursuant to s. 16(1).
Expressly excluded from applying is a person who was convicted of the designated substance offence in relation to which the property was forfeited.","Accused is charged with second degree murder in the death of his estranged wife.
The Crown sought to admit into evidence a number of statements that were made by the deceased to several crown witnesses concerning two previous incidents she had with the accused in the weeks prior to her death.
In the first incident, the accused is alleged to have choked the victim after he confronted her about where she had been.
In the second incident the accused confronted the victim and beat and choked her and then sexually assaulted and threatened to kill her.
The Crown seeks to admit this similar fact evidence and several hearsay statements to prove the issues of motive, intent and modus operandi.
HELD: The statements by the deceased are not admissible.
The prejudicial nature of the similar fact evidence has not been overcome by its probative value.
It is well established law that similar acts and other discreditable conduct evidence is presumptively inadmissible and that similar fact evidence is the exception to this.
To determine its admissibility, three things need examination, 1) the probative weight of the evidence, 2) the assessment of the prejudice and 3) the weighing of the probative value versus prejudicial value.
In examining the probative weight of the evidence, factors to be considered include the issues in question, the presence or absence of collusion, similarities and dissimilarities between the facts charged and the similar fact evidence and the strength of the evidence that the events occurred.
The two previous incidents are extremely prejudicial in nature leading to potential moral prejudice.
That is, reprehensible nature of the assaults could lead the jury to rely on the prohibited inference that the accused is the type of person who could have committed the crime.
There is also a great risk of reasoning prejudice.
That is, admitting the similar fact evidence may distract the jury from their proper focus which is the second degree murder charge.
There is a possibility that the jury will equate the intention to harm with the mens rea required for a murder conviction.
With respect to the hearsay evidence, the Court held that statements made by the deceased to her friends, family and colleagues concerning the threats and assaults will not be admitted.
The test of necessity is clearly met by the fact that the person making the statements in now deceased and not able to testify.
However, the Court was concerned about the reliability of the statements since there is nothing that would serve as convincing indicia of reliability adequate to offset the absence of an oath.","[0, 1, 2, 9, 3, 10, 6, 8, 11, 5, 7, 19, 4, 23]"

TUCKER DECISION [1] A horrible event has taken place which has resulted in serious injury to a member of this community.
Several individuals have told the police that the accused youth is responsible for those injuries.
[2] The Crown has conceded that there is no reason to detain the accused youth to ensure her attendance in court, or to prevent further offences on her part.
[3] The Crown has argued, in essence, that its case is strong, the offence is horrible, and that the public in La Ronge and area are so disturbed and shocked by the occurrence, that to release the youth would cause a loss of confidence in the administration of justice on the part of the public.
[4] In effect, the Crown says that because several persons have told the police that this youth committed a serious offence, I should confine her in custody even before she has a trial, before anyone has given evidence against her, under oath, in a court of law, and before she has had a chance to defend herself at a trial.
The Crown believes I should do this because the public in La Ronge and area will feel the justice system has failed if I do not keep her locked up until she has a trial.","The plaintiff seeks damages for unlawful arrest and assault, including aggravated or punitive damages arising out of events which resulted in his arrest and a charge of obstruction.
During the course of his arrest, the plaintiff received cut to his scalp.
He remained in custody until released at approximately 7:30 a.m. that morning.
The three named defendants are members of the Saskatoon Police Service.
The City of Saskatoon is their employer.
HELD: The action for wrongful arrest is dismissed.
The plaintiff was assaulted when his head was driven onto the hood of the vehicle.
The plaintiff is awarded $2,500 in general damages and pre-judgment interest on that amount.
It is not an appropriate case to award punitive damages, but the Court awarded solicitor client costs to the plaintiff in the amount of $6,000 plus taxable disbursements.
1) The Court accepted the plaintiff's evidence that he did not physically interfere with the police officers outside of the lounge.
The police officers that attended at the lounge and became involved in the arrest of Mr. Sampson were in the execution of their duty.
The plaintiff does not dispute that he possessed the general intent to make the comments that he did throughout the proceedings and that he did so wilfully.
The issue is whether or not his actions obstructed the police officers, who were in the execution of their duty.
2) The combined actions of the plaintiff and Ms. Krupa clearly interfered with the police officers' arrest of Mr. Sampson, to the point that Constable Pura called for back-up help.
Once the back-up officers arrived, one of them was required to expend time and effort restricting the movements of the plaintiff and Ms. Krupa.
Once on the street, they again confronted the police officers.
Their combined actions clearly affected the work of the police officers in the execution of their duty.
There were reasonable and probable grounds to believe the plaintiff was obstructing the police officers in the course of their duty.
3) On the facts in this matter, the same conclusion is arrived at based solely on the plaintiff's individual actions.
The plaintiff's officious interference consisted of verbal abuse, excessive criticism and undue pertinacity in his discussion and questioning and provided reasonable and probable grounds to believe he was obstructing police officers in the execution of their duty.
The action for wrongful arrest is dismissed.
4) The cut to the plaintiff's head is a minor one, not requiring stitches or immediate medical attention.
The plaintiff experienced headaches for several weeks.
He also had stiff neck and sleep disturbance.
There were no long term effects.

(orally)[1] The Crown seeks leave appeal the sentence imposed on the respondent after a sentencing circle.
The respondent committed the offences while on probation.
[2] The facts are essentially agreed and are as follows: On March 19, 2000, the respondent, Nelson Kahnapace, and a co‑accused, Wayne Moshenko, did break and enter a dwelling house in Regina, the residence of 68 year‑old man who lives alone, and committed robbery.
The respondent was very intoxicated and did not participate in the beginning of the transaction.
The co-accused told him they were going there because the victim had the keys to Moshenko's vehicle.
Moshenko had given the victim the keys as security for some money.","There is no dispute between the parties as to the nature of the plaintiff's investment in the defendant corporation.
The real issue between the parties is whether the plaintiff is entitled to the summary relief, which she now seeks pursuant to Rules 129 and 133 of The Queen's Bench Rules.
It is the position of the plaintiff that the cross- examination of the defendant on his affidavit discloses that the corporation is profitable company and that s. 34(2) of The Business Corporation Act does not provide any defence to the defendants against the requested relief sought.
The parties are in disagreement over the issue of the amount of dividend payments that have been made by the corporation to the plaintiff pursuant to her investment in the corporation.
HELD: 1) The plaintiff's application for summary judgment does not require the corporation to redeem any redeemable shares.
Rather, the plaintiff's application is one seeking summary judgment.
The corporate defendant is not making payment to redeem shares, but rather following judgment however and whenever obtained, it would be subject to the normal judgment process, including execution.
Such execution or enforcement of judgment is not tantamount to redemption of shares.
The plaintiff provided notice in writing to the corporation that she wished to redeem all her Class E preferred shares effective March 2005.
The principal amount of her shares is $214,600.
It is this amount that she seeks as the substance of her summary judgment.
Section 34(2) of the Act does not serve to prevent the plaintiff seeking summary judgment from the court.
The effect of granting judgment, if it is otherwise appropriate to do so, does not place the corporation in a position of breaching the prohibitions contained in s. 34(2) of the Act.
2) The defendants have not demonstrated that there is real insolvency on the part of the corporation.
The defendants have failed to provide responses to the undertakings.
Further, the defendants have not provided any professional analysis or evidence in support of their position that s. 34(2) is applicable.
3) The amount sought to be recovered by the plaintiff does represent debt or liquidated demand as contemplated by Rule 129.
The plaintiff is entitled to summary judgment against the defendant corporation for the sum of $214,600 pursuant to Rule 129.
Further the plaintiff is entitled to interest at the rate of 16% from March 2005 in accordance with the Share Agreement.
4) The plaintiff has not demonstrated an appropriate basis for summary judgment against the individual defendants.
5) The plaintiff is entitled to costs.","[1, 0, 2, 4, 6, 8, 7, 3, 10, 9]"

Does the plaintiff’s response to the Demand for Particulars fulfill the requirements of Rules 142 and 164 of the Rules?","The plaintiff, while working as security officer in mall, was run down in the parking lot as he was pursuing shoplifter.
The van that struck him, driven by second individual, was being used as getaway vehicle.
The issue before the court was whether the agreed-upon damages were to be paid by the liability insurer of the registered owner of the vehicle (who was not the driver) or by the plaintiff's Section D (uninsured motorist) insurer.
As the first defendant remained the registered owner of the vehicle at the relevant time and failed to rebut the statutory presumption that it was being operated by the second defendant (who had now disappeared) with his consent at that time, the vehicle's insurer was responsible to pay the plaintiff's damages.
The action against the plaintiff's Section D insurer is dismissed.
The case turned on numerous credibility issues as the registered owner of the vehicle professed to have sold it few days prior to the incident (although he maintained insurance on the vehicle for several months afterwards), and it was argued that the second defendant (whom the plaintiff had detained for shoplifting earlier that day) was not the driver of the vehicle.","[6, 5, 4, 12, 7, 8, 10, 11, 3, 14, 13, 19, 0, 18, 9, 20, 16, 21, 22, 15, 24, 25, 26, 1, 29, 30, 31, 33, 34, 23, 35, 39]"

The current portion of the long term debt was deducted on its balance sheet before calculation of retained earnings.","The appellant appealed his conviction for possession for the purpose of trafficking methamphetamine contrary to s. 5(2) of the Controlled Drugs and Substances Act.
His sole ground of appeal hinges on the court accepting fresh evidence.
HELD: The application to adduce fresh evidence is dismissed.
There being no ground of appeal other than that there would be a miscarriage of justice if the conviction were affirmed in light of the fresh evidence, the appeal is dismissed.
1) Applying the case law to the fresh evidence, they fail the test for admission.
2) With respect to the evidence of Megan Bairos and her friend, we still do not have this evidence before us.
All we have is the appellant's statement as to what they will say, which must fail on the basis of hearsay.
Any evidence sought to be adduced under the discretion of what is now s. 683 of the Code must be admissible evidence.
With respect to the evidence of Ms. Brinkman, she does not swear that Ms. Bodkin was selling methamphetamine at the relevant time.
3) With respect to due diligence, it must be noted that the appellant had the assistance of experienced counsel at trial and who represents him before this court.
The appellant decided to proceed with the trial despite the absence of the two witnesses who he now seeks to put forward.
If the appellant's application were to succeed, it would encourage the splitting of trial simply to obtain an order for new trial with all of the attendant delays and other problems.
4) In the court's view, the result could not reasonably be expected to be any different if the fresh evidence was admitted and a new trial ordered.","[0, 1, 4, 3, 2, 5, 6, 7, 8, 11, 12, 13]"

March 14, 2001[1] A consent judgment of January 10, 2000 arising out of a settlement pre-trial conference provides, inter alia:2.
AND IT IS HEREBY FURTHER ORDERED AND ADJUDGED that the Respondent, Ronald Kim Fellinger, shall have access to the children of the marriage at all reasonable times including the following: a) On alternate weekends from Friday evening at 7:00 p.m. until Sunday evening at 8:30 p.m., to be extended to Monday evening in the event of a long weekend.... 3.
AND IT IS HEREBY FURTHER ORDERED AND ADJUDGED that the Respondent, Ronald Kim Fellinger, shall pay the Petitioner, Layna Kathleen Segall, for the support, maintenance, and education of the children the sum of $1,000.00 per month, such sum representing basic child support of $774.00 per month and a further $226.00 per month for the Respondent's proportionate share of child care costs.
For purposes of calculating the child support, the income of the Respondent is set at $59,800.00.
Under the terms of the judgment the petitioner has custody of their children, Rikki-Lee, age 12 and Lucas, age 7.
[2] On November 23, 2000, the respondent served an application to vary the child support provisions of the consent judgment including his contribution to child care expenses as well as the access provisions.
The respondent says his income is reduced and refers to his 1999 tax return indicating an income of $42,386.34.

The flight was delayed for about 1.5 hours at the Dominican Republic airport as result of several mechanical difficulties.
The claim is with respect to alleged negligence, unlawful confinement and breach of contract.
HELD: The applicant has failed to establish the first criteria as set out in s. 6(a) of the Act.
The application for certification is dismissed on that basis.
1) The court accepts that all of the defendants are governed by the provisions of the Montreal Convention of 1999.
The wording of Article 29 of that agreement is clear.
Any claims for damages of passenger of an international flight can only be brought within the ambit of the Montreal Convention of 1999.
The court reviewed the cases and found that the plaintiff's claims outside the ambit of the Montreal Convention of 1999 in negligence, breach of contract, unlawful confinement and punitive damages do not disclose a cause of action.
2) The sole exclusive remedy available to passengers is set out in Article 17(1) of the Montreal Convention of 1999.
strict liability regime has been set up with cap of damages where passenger sustains 'bodily injury' as result of an injury that occurs in the course of embarking or disembarking.
It is settled law that for a passenger to have access to Article 17(1), the individual must have suffered a bodily injury as opposed to mere mental anguish.
It has not been established that any bodily injury has been sustained by any of the passengers on Flight 361.
It is plain and obvious that the claim does not raise a reasonable cause of action.

Siwak For the Plaintiff Mr. J. Hardy For the DefendantDECISION S. C. CARTER, J [1] The parties to this action signed a handwritten agreement on the 20th day of October, 2004.
The entire document reads as follows: Date - 20-Oct-2004 Contract between Brian Benson and Ray DobsonThis contract is to cover feeding and maintenance of about one hundred and one cows to be boarded at Brian Benson’s farm at Canwood, Sask.
Conditions of this contract is as follows: 1.
Brian is to provide labor and equipment necessary to feed and maintain these cows for a set price of $0.50 per day per cow.
2.
Ray is to provide adequate feed.
This feed will be the responsibility of Brian’s to purchase at a fair market price as agent for Ray.
3.
Ray is responsible for all vet expenses and medical supplies.

Division of the matrimonial property is at issue.
The issues include what amounts, if any, are to be added to the sources of income set out in the father's total income in his T1 General form to come to the appropriate level of income for the purpose of calculating child maintenance payments.
HELD: 1) The father's income has fluctuated significantly in the last years, and the inherent nature of farming is such that it is more appropriate in the circumstances to this operation to use year average. 2) Non-arm's length salary will be added back into income unless the father established that payments were necessary and reasonable.
In 2004 the amount of salary paid to the mother for bookkeeping was $5,000.
It would appear that the $15,000 paid in 2003 was means of splitting income. $5,000 appears to be reasonable amount. 3)
Some of the personal expenses claimed as farm expenses such as electricity, home heat, telephone, meals and office expenses should be added back to income.
The father has added back portion of these expenses based on certain percentages being allocated to personal use.
It has not been established that more amounts need to be added back. 4)
The majority of the capital cost allowance on personal property owned by the father relates to his motor vehicle.
He states the personal use of his truck is 10%.
The full amount claimed for capital cost allowance is not necessary for the replacement of the vehicle.
This along with significant personal use of the vehicle makes it reasonable to add back 50% of the capital cost allowance claimed in each of the years in question. 5)
The mother has asked that the Court add back to the father's personal income the amounts claimed in the partnership and then allocated to the individual partners.
The father's income tax return includes personal farm component which consists of much smaller income and expense statement on matters that are totally within his control and for which all benefits accrue to him.
His tax return also includes the partnership statement which shows the same types of income and expenses but on partnership basis.
There are five partners involved, two are his brothers and the other two are his cousins.
There is no evidence to suggest that the income statements of the partnership are fashioned in such way to reflect an inaccurate picture on cash basis of the operation of the farm partnership.
There is nothing to suggest that the partnership is organizing its expenses or distribution to artificially lower the income of the father.
This is not situation where the father is the sole shareholder in corporation.
This is not situation in which there is majority ownership in the partnership which would allow the father to control the activities of income distribution or asset purchase.
There is nothing in the Guidelines to suggest that the Court should be adding back any of the partnership amounts to the income of the father automatically.
There is nothing in the evidence that would lead the Court to the conclusion capital cost allowance being claimed by partnership is inappropriate or indeed that any of the expenses or accounting functions used by the partnership do not reflect the partnership business over the long term.
The Court was not prepared to add back to the income of the father the personal expenses claimed in partnership returns as farm expenses, capital cost allowance on real property or personal property owned by the partnership.
6) The total income averaged over 3 years comes to $29,983 each year.
Child maintenance shall be paid on that amount.","[2, 4, 5, 3, 1, 7, 0, 6, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14]"

They never married.
Now, Lawrence is seeking access to Melodie’s daughter from an earlier relationship.
That child is Trista, who is 11 years old.
I.
Background 2) Lawrence and Melodie met in October, 2000 at the bar where she was working.
They started dating that night.
At the time Melodie was still living with Trista’s father Greg.
She left him in January, 2001, living temporarily with friends before moving to her own apartment.
Several months later, in the spring of 2001, she rented a house in Codette and moved there with Trista.
Lawrence moved at the same time, bringing with him his two daughters, who were then 11 and 13 years of age.
Trista was just over two years old.
When working days, Melodie says that Trista was at day care.
At other times, Lawrence or his daughters would watch over her.
3) Lawrence describes having developed a somewhat idyllic relationship with Trista.
He met her within a week of starting to date Melodie.
4) People who knew both Lawrence and Melodie while they were living together spoke positively about the bond that developed between Lawrence and Trista.
Lawrence treated Trista as his own child and she, in turn, called him “dad”.","The Crown appeals the decision of the Provincial Court judge that found the respondent's rights under s. 10(b) of the Charter has been violated and in excluding the certificate of analysis, acquitted the respondent.
The Crown argues that the trial judge misapplied the reasoning of the Supreme Court in R. v. Prosper in his analysis of the circumstances surrounding the police officer's demand for the respondent to provide his breath sample.
The issue on this appeal is whether Prosper requires the police in the Saskatchewan jurisdiction, where faced with a detainee that has changed his mind and declined legal advice, to inform that detainee that he has a right to a reasonable opportunity to contact a lawyer and that the police have an obligation not to require the detainee to participate in any incriminating process until the detainee has had a reasonable opportunity to contact a lawyer.
HELD: 1) Prosper addresses the issue of the police's obligation in jurisdictions where free, preliminary legal advice is unavailable.
Oppositely, Saskatchewan has Brydges duty counsel available to detainees and no such obligation exists.
Having reviewed the law as stated in Prosper, the Court concluded that the trial judge erred in finding that this case was analogous to the facts in Prosper, and in finding that the police officer had an obligation to provide a 'Prosper warning' to the respondent once the respondent had changed his mind and declined legal advice.
2) The police in Saskatchewan are required to provide any detainee with information so that detainee may access that legal advice.
Once the police are confronted with detainee who changes his mind and declines legal advice, this waiver must be clear and unequivocal.
3) The evidence falls far short of proving that the respondent was frustrated, impatient probably, but not frustrated.
The exchange lasted about minutes.
The evidence shows a detainee who chose to neither wait for the telephone line to be available nor to telephone a private lawyer.","[4, 3, 7, 9, 1, 5, 6, 17, 16, 13, 10, 15, 8, 12, 18, 25, 11, 23]"

By agreed statement of facts and issue, the parties have agreed that the issue to be determined is whether the Bank has priority to, or entitlement to, the equipment subject to the Lease.
This requires a determination of whether the Lease was a 'lease for a term of more than one year' as defined by s. 2(1)(y) of The Personal Property Security Act.
HELD: The respondent was 'regularly engaged in the business of leasing', within the meaning of s. 2(1)(y)(iv) of the PPSA and therefore is not entitled to the exemption from registration requirements of s. 3 of the Act.
The lease in question was therefore 'a lease for a term of more than one year' within the meaning of the Act and it required registration.
Having failed to register its leasehold interest at the personal property registry, the respondent's claim to the equipment is subordinate to the registered and first priority claim of the Bank.
1) There is no evidence of any business activity at all that the respondent engaged in until May 2001 when it had transferred back to it Sweeprite's land, building and equipment.
The respondent in turn rented back the building, land and equipment, none of which ever left Sweeprite's possession, to Sweeprite under the terms of non-written agreement.
Sweeprite paid rental to the respondent.
Ultimately the respondent and Sweeprite entered into the equipment lease for term of years.
2) In 2001 when the non-written lease/rental agreement first began, the respondent had no other business except the ownership and lease to and/or rental of the land, building and equipment to Sweeprite.
It was not until December of 2001 when it obtained the research and development contract with Rite Way.
3) The business of leasing, which had started in the spring of 2001 under the non-written arrangement and which continued thereafter by virtue of the equipment lease until the bankruptcy of Sweeprite, was from May to December of 2001 the only business of the respondent and thereafter continued to be a significant part of the respondent's business.","[0, 1, 4, 3, 8, 10, 11, 7, 15, 16, 12, 17, 21, 23, 5, 24, 28, 6, 26, 25, 9, 30, 27, 32, 34, 19, 13, 36, 35, 38, 18, 43, 20]"

HELD: 1) The Court reviewed the cases from the Supreme Court of Canada regarding retroactive child support and in particular D.B.S. v. S.R.G. et al, 2006 SCC 37. 2)
The respondent has been content to accept $380 per month as fair level of child support for both children.
What precipitated the respondent's review in July 2006 was Meghan's departure from his home where she began to live independently with the prospect of attending college.
What further propelled the continued action on the respondent's part was the publicity attendant with the Supreme Court of Canada's release of its judgment in July 2006.
There is no reasonable excuse as to why the respondent did not seek a variation earlier, other than concluding that the respondent accepted $380 per month as reasonable in the circumstances that prevailed from July 2003 to July 2006.
3) There is no evidence of blameworthy conduct on the petitioner's part.
There was no agreement or obligation to disclose tax returns.
No written request was made pursuant to s. 25 of the Guidelines.
No verbal request was made by the respondent which might fall within the definition of 'effective notice'.
The increase in the petitioner's level of income over the years 2002 to 2005 is not so dramatic as to constitute blameworthy conduct that privileges the petitioner's own interests over her children's right to an appropriate amount of support.
In 2002, the petitioner earned $32,800 and, by 2005, she earned $43,310.
An increase of these proportions would not lead the Court to conclude that the petitioner was not contributing to her children's support in a satisfactory manner.
The Court's view of the evidence is that the annual increases equivalent to roughly 10% per annum, when adjusted for the annual rate of inflation, are not so significant that the petitioner would have reasonably thought that she was feathering her own nest at the expense of her children.
4) There was no evidence that the children's standard of living was compromised as a direct consequence of the petitioner not taking the initiative to adjust her child support payments annually.
Nor was there evidence of financial hardship experienced by the children.
5) To order retroactive support of $4,322, whether payable in a lump sum or by installments over time, would represent a hardship to a wage earner in the petitioner's category.
The application for retroactive child support is dismissed.","[0, 1, 2, 4, 5, 3, 6, 7, 8, 11, 13, 10, 14, 15, 16, 17, 9, 12]"

The ground is that Leo Dion, the designated officer of the corporation pursuant to an agreement between the parties, failed to appear at an examination for discovery on November 23, 1993.
The plaintiff applies to strike the statement of defence of the individual defendant, Louis Dion, on the same grounds.
Scheduling of the Examinations In each case the plaintiff's solicitors had on several occasions telephoned the defendants' solicitor to schedule examinations for discovery and to obtain statements as to documents.
Finally the plaintiff's solicitors wrote to the defendants' solicitor proposing a range of dates for the examinations for discovery and requesting the defendants' statements as to documents.
The letter indicated that if no reply was made by October 25, 1993, the examinations would be unilaterally scheduled.
The appointments were served on the defendants' solicitor at Prince Albert along with conduct money to cover travel from Prince Albert to Saskatoon and return.
This step prompted a brief letter from the defendants' solicitor to the effect that he had ""difficulty"" with the appointments.","The plaintiff commenced an action against the defendant for failing to supply three of the four quarterly amounts of coal due pursuant to their contract.

The action arose out of burn suffered by the appellant while participating in demolition derby run by the defendants.
The motion was granted on the premise there was no case to go to the jury because the appellant had failed to adduce sufficient evidence of the requisite causal connection between his injury and the alleged acts of negligence, and the standard of care required of the respondents.
In consequence, the trial judge dismissed the action with costs to the respondents.
The issue on appeal is whether the trial judge applied the test correctly in light of the evidence.
HELD: Appeal dismissed.
1) Had the case been permitted to go to the jury on the theory of the appellant, the jury would have been asked to conclude on a balance of probabilities that, but for the actions of the flagman who failed to immediately halt the competition and alert the Fire Department to the condition he had observed, the appellant would have suffered less serious burns than he in fact suffered.
Similarly, the jury would have been asked to conclude that, but for the failure of the volunteer fire fighters to take more effective action, the appellant would have suffered less serious burns.
The jury could not have arrived at either conclusion, given the evidence of the duration the appellant was on fire, about 30 seconds, and the expert evidence that his injuries would have occurred virtually instantaneously or within 5 to 6 seconds of his having caught on fire while still in his vehicle.
In the light of this evidence, and in the absence of further evidence of the standard of care required of each of the respondent, the Court is of the opinion the jury could not rationally have concluded that either of the respondents caused or materially contributed to the extend of the appellant's injury.
On the basis of the expert evidence, the damage would have occurred just the same, fault or no fault on the part of the respondents.
That being so, the damage could not be seen to have been caused or materially contributed to by the respondents.

The grounds for the application were that the mother had failed to abide by the terms of the original judgment and had refused to provide the father with any information as to the location of herself and the child since the date of that judgment.
The mother had left Saskatoon, taking the child with her and, subsequent to police involvement and several Court orders to assist in locating the child, was arrested on Canada-wide warrant in Edmonton, Alberta and charged pursuant to ss. 281(1) and 283 of the Criminal Code of Canada with child abduction and contravention of custody order.

The father filed a further application seeking an order allowing him to relocate the child to Whitehorse, Yukon, for residential purposes.
The mother opposed the father's application for relocation, and prayed that she be granted less restrictive access to the child.
The issues were as follows.
1) Should the father be granted sole custody of the child?
2) Should the father be allowed to relocate with the child to Whitehorse, Yukon?
3) What access to the child should be granted to the mother?
HELD: Application allowed.
The father shall have the costs of the trial on party and party basis. 1)
The starting point for the Court's review is whether the father has demonstrated material change in the circumstances affecting the child.
The Court is satisfied that there has been a material change in the circumstances that existed at the time of the original custody judgment when it was thought that the cooperation of the parties necessary for joint custody was possible.
As the mother has demonstrated it was not, review of the order to determine whether change in custody or access order is in the best interests of the child, having regard to all of the circumstances of this case.
Based on the original findings and the evidence at trial that the father has cared well for the child, as well as the mother's conduct in attempting to avoid shared parenting, the Court is satisfied that it is in the child's best interests to grant sole custody to the father.
2) The evidence at trial confirmed the seven points that the father outlined in support of the proposed relocation to Whitehorse.
In reviewing each of seven factors set out in the case law and considering the best interests of the child, the Court approves the father's plan to relocate to Whitehorse.
3) It is in the child's best interests to continue the mother's existing access arrangements with the child until the child moves with the father to Yukon, at which time the new access arrangements set out in this decision will apply.
Detailed orders are issued accordingly.","[9, 2, 3, 5, 0, 15]"

Moran for the Director of Labour StandardsJUDGMENT MacDONALD J. September 9, 1999[1] The plaintiff, Daniel Tapp (""Tapp""), is a practising lawyer in the Province of Saskatchewan.
On March 4, 1999, Tapp commenced an action against the defendant, 626170 Saskatchewan Ltd. for fees and disbursements in the amount of $4,647.85.
[2] On March 9, 1999, Tapp obtained a garnishee summons issued prior to judgment against the said defendant and served it on Saskatchewan Property Management Corporation (""SPMC""), the proposed garnishee.
[3] As a result of that garnishee, the sum of $337.46 was paid into court on April 26, 1999, to the credit of Q.B.G.
639 of 1999.
On April 13, 1999, an application was made by SPMC on Q.B.G.
That order was granted by Justice Wright together with costs of the application to SPMC to be taxed.
[4] Prior to the application the sum of $2,521.68 had been paid into court on March 30, 1999, on Q.B.G.","Application for judicial review of a board of arbitration award that held the First Nations University of Canada had violated certain provisions of a collective agreement in force between the parties.
The grievance alleged that the University had interfered with faculty member's academic freedom.
The allegation concerned the withdrawal of an invitation to that faculty member to be the keynote speaker at National Symposium on Post Secondary Education Policy and Funding that was held on campus, although the University was not directly involved.
After one of the chief organizers examined the faculty member's thesis and determined it would not provide suitable foundation for the symposium's keynote address, the invitation was withdrawn.
The faculty member sought to have the decision reversed, and requested the University's Board of Governors' intervention.
When the faculty member's request came up at one of the Board's meetings, one of its members made some inappropriate comments and expressed personal animus towards the faculty member.
No decision was reached at that meeting.
The respondent Board of Arbitration found that, in failing in his obligation to refrain from interfering in and to defend the academic freedom of a faculty member, the Board member's comportment amounted to a violation of the collective agreement by the employer.
The applicant argued that the Board of Arbitration exceeded its jurisdiction by entertaining a grievance that did not involve parties to the collective agreement.
Further, it argued that the Board of Arbitration made a determination of an issue not raised in the grievance, namely, a finding that there was a violation of academic freedom.
HELD: The application is dismissed with costs.
The Board of Arbitration found that the member of the University's Board of Governors' comportment at the meeting did not accord with the requirements of certain articles of the collective agreement.
The reasons of the Board of Arbitration support that finding and the decision meets the reasonableness test.
The fact that the member of the Board of Governors was acting in his capacity as Chair brought the issue within the purview of the collective agreement.
The Court disagrees with the applicant's contention that the Board of Arbitration made a determination of an issue not raised in the grievance directly.","[0, 1, 3, 4, 6, 5, 8, 7, 10, 9, 2, 12, 13]"

Her contention is that she instructed the Town Office to shut off her water supply and the failure to do so led to the damages being sustained.
II EVIDENCE ON BEHALF OF THE PLAINTIFFNorma Isaac[3] Ms. Isaac testified that she purchased a rental property in 1999 at 233 - 1st Street South, Martensville.
She rented the house to her son for $500.00 per month up until September, 2005, when her son vacated the premises.
Her intent was to sell the property to her daughter, Jennifer and her husband, David, who were then living in Saskatoon.
She believed they were ultimately going to rebuild on the site after renting out the property for a time and perhaps selling the house and having it moved as a lake cabin.
[4] To this end, Ms. Isaac attended at the Town Office in Martensville on November 28, 2005, and terminated her water account.
Her recollection was that she instructed the water be shut off effective the day she was in because she was having the power cut off shortly thereafter, which was effective on December 10.
[5] She did not recall signing any authorization to this effect.","The Crown appeals the sentence to the extent that the victim surcharge was waived.
The appeal is made on the basis that the trial judge did not comply with the mandatory provisions of s. 737 of the Criminal Code.
HELD: The imposition of a victim fine surcharge under s. 737 of the code is mandatory subject only to an application under s. 737(5) relating to undue hardship.
If an offender is exempted from payment of the victim surcharge, it is also mandatory that the Court give reasons.
The sentence is varied to include an order requiring the respondent to pay a victim surcharge in the amount of $30.","[2, 1, 6, 5, 7, 4, 9, 11, 10]"

For the DefendantJUDGMENT B.D.
HALDERMAN, P.C.J.
JUNE 8, 2000BASIS OF CLAIM:[1] The Plaintiff’s claim against the Defendant is for crop damage sustained as a result of the Defendant’s cattle getting into the Plaintiff’s canola field in late July, 1999.
[2] The Defendant admits that his cattle were in the Plaintiff’s canola crop on one occasion.
The Defendant says that there is no evidence that his cattle were in the canola on any other occasion, and that such loss as was caused by his cattle is minimal.
[3] In his pleadings, the Defendant denies any liability under s.27 of The Stray Animals Act, R.S.S.
1978, c. S-60, and further denies that he was negligent in looking after his cattle.
Sections 27 (1) and (2) of The Stray Animals Act, R.S.S.","The accused brings an application pursuant to s. 520 of the Criminal Code for a review of the order denying him judicial interim release.
HELD: The accused's continued detention is necessary for the protection of the public
The Court puts significant weight on the accused's continued disregard of court orders and the fact that the number and severity of the assault incidents is increasing.
The accused received the benefit of conditional sentence in April 2006 and in July was found to have breached the orders which formed part of the conditional sentence.
He is now facing additional allegations of breach.
Even though he was bound by conditional sentence and was charged with another violent offence, which is alleged to have occurred in September, he was once again released from custody in October.
This was followed by the allegation of yet another and more serious assault which has lead to the accused remaining in custody for the last months.","[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 0, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 36, 37, 38, 39, 40, 41, 35, 42, 43, 44, 45, 46, 47, 48, 49, 50, 51, 52, 53, 54, 55, 56, 57, 60, 58, 59, 63, 61, 68, 65, 64, 66, 62]"

TALLIS - for the petitionerD.Z.
BRAUN - for the respondentJUDGMENT HUNTER J.
DATE: JUNE 20, 1996The Respondent father applies to reduce the amount of on-going maintenance of $600.00 per month for his 2 daughters and to reduce the accumulated arrears of approximately $14,600.00.
The original corollary relief judgment was made in 1989.
An application for variation was dismissed in 1993 except that an order suspending enforcement of arrears during periods when the respondent is unemployed was granted.
The Petitioner resides in Winnipeg, Manitoba and has custody of both daughters.
She is employed and while her income has increased since 1989, her expenses have increased correspondingly.
Petitioner chose to file material in response to this application and wants the matter dealt with summarily on affidavit evidence and does not want a trial of the issue directed.
Since the judgment, respondent's employer closed the Saskatoon operation and he has since been working as a pipe- fitter.
The respondent is hired on jobs in accordance with the union hiring hall practices.","The plaintiff is an employee of the City of Saskatoon and member of the Union.
He commenced this claim based on the Indemnity Clause contained in the Union's bylaws.
The plaintiff asserts he is involved in Union related litigation and is thus entitled to the benefit of the indemnity clause.
HELD: The plaintiff's application for summary judgment is dismissed.
The within action is dismissed in full.
1) The essential nature of the debate between the plaintiff and the Union relates to the interpretation of the indemnity clause in the Union bylaws.
This is precisely the type of internal dispute that is not within the exclusive realm of the Labour Relations Board.
The forum for this contest is the Queen's Bench Court and this Court has jurisdiction to entertain his claim under Queen's Bench Rule 485 for summary judgment.
2) The plaintiff represents himself.
He has incurred no legal fees, other than disbursements, but he nonetheless asserts that he is entitled to $50,000.
The figure of $50,000 is proffered by the plaintiff as an appropriate sum as he expects the defendant has spent at least that much defending all four actions.
3) It is plain and obvious that the plaintiff's claim is grounded on an interpretation of the indemnity clause that is so illogical and inconsistent with its plain wording that it cannot succeed.
The plaintiff's claim for reimbursement of costs not incurred is equally incapable of success.","[0, 2, 3, 1, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11]"

Merchant for the respondentFIAT GEREIN J.April 5, 1999[1] This is an application wherein the respondent seeks an order for interim spousal support.
I have concluded that relief should be granted, but in the circumstances it should not take the form of spousal support.
Facts[2] The parties were married on January 24, 1981, and ceased to cohabit on December 29, 1996.
There are three children who live with the petitioner.
[3] The respondent is 52 years of age and is unemployed.
In the past he has been diagnosed as paranoid schizophrenic and suffering from a personality disorder.
His present physician describes him as being of sound mind and able to manage his own affairs.
In any event, in 1987 he qualified for a disability pension under the Canada Pension Plan by reason of his mental disability.
This provides his basic income of $580.00 a month.
When you factor in the G.S.T.
rebate his total monthly income is $630.00.
In his financial statement, the respondent states his monthly expenses are $595.00.","The applicant school teacher asked to be discharged from $20k in student loan debts under s.178(1.1) of the Bankruptcy and Insolvency Act.
He had filed consumer proposal in 2001, which he completed successfully in 2006.
He earned $50,874 (gross) per annum; was at the top of his pay scale; had two young children; and his wife worked half-time position at Aliant, earning $16,272 year.
There were daycare costs when the wife worked, and the applicant's transportation costs were high (but reasonable).
The wife had significant debts and no remaining credit; she paid around $1,000 month to service her cards.
The applicant did not have any credit either.
Their home had little, if any, equity.
The AG agreed the applicant had acted in good faith, but contested whether he was (and would continue to be) unable to pay the debt.
Application allowed.
Permitting the applicant's family a reasonably frugal lifestyle, which the court found they had, would mean he could not pay off the loan.
Using the Superintendent's standards, there might be a small surplus in the family budget, but it would take many years for the applicant to significantly reduce his liability.
If the application were refused, he would have to consider bankruptcy.","[0, 1, 2, 5, 7, 9, 4, 6, 13, 14, 15, 11, 10, 12, 3, 18]"
1002,"They contend the hearing officer, who rendered her decision on May 31, 2012, committed several errors of law and seek to have the matter remitted back for re-hearing.
[2] The record on this appeal is comprised of the notice of appeal, the decision of the hearing officer and the hearing officer's file which includes documents filed by the parties along with file endorsements and notes.
[3] The basic facts are these.
The parties executed a one year written residential lease on August 23, 2011.
Rent was fixed at $1,100 per month payable on the first of each month.
[4] By letter of April 1, 2012 the landlord gave the tenants a 30 day notice of eviction for non payment of rent.
The tenants were permitted to remain in the premises until the end of May provided they paid the balance owing on the March rent ($100) along with the full monthly rent for May.
This notice was followed by a subsequent letter of April 16th wherein the landlord demanded an immediate (24 hour) eviction from the premises.
No grounds were specified in this letter nor did the tenants vacate the premises.
[5] Its not completely clear from the file what, if anything the tenants paid in response to the April letters.","This appeal was brought on a narrow ground from a judgment in the Court of Queen's Bench granting variation of a child support order pursuant to s. 17(1) of the Divorce Act.
The appeal challenged the chambers judge's interpretation and application of s. 7(1.1) of the Federal Child Support Guidelines, which defines the term 'extraordinary expenses.'
The appellant argued that the chambers judge erred in ordering the appellant to contribute proportionately to the costs associated with the children's extracurricular activities without finding that these were 'extraordinary expenses' within the meaning of the Guidelines.
The appellant argued these expenses were ordinary and not extraordinary within the meaning of s. 7(1)(d) and (f) and s. 7(1.1) of the Guidelines.
It was the appellant's position that these expenses were covered by the basic child support order which the respondent received tax free, in addition to the appellant's responsibility for 73% of the children's health care and day care expenses.
HELD: Appeal dismissed with costs to the respondent.
Per Hunter J.A. (Gerwing J.A. concurring):
All the information needed to determine the s. 7(1)(f) expenses eligible for proportionate sharing was before the Chambers judge: he knew the total income of the recipient spouse; he knew the previous extracurricular activities and the 11 current extracurricular activities that the children participated in, along with the estimated annual cost.
Updated financial statements were filed by both the appellant and respondent.
The Chambers judge exercised his discretion and granted an order requiring the appellant to pay his proportionate share (73%) of the extracurricular activities he listed, which is approximately one-half of the children's extracurricular activities.
Accordingly, he did not make a palpable and overriding error, nor did he err in law, and his conclusion is supported by the evidence before him on this application.
There is no basis to interfere with the decision of the Chambers judge.
Per Smith J.A. (in dissent):
Significant deference must be given by this Court to the chambers judge in relation to child support orders.
This is particularly so to the extent that such orders involve the exercise of discretion.
In this case the trial judge erred in law in failing to consider and apply the definition of 'special or extraordinary expenses' in s. 7(1.1) of the Guidelines.
First, it is impossible without some evidence, explanation or explicit finding, to understand why even the total of all the children's extracurricular activities would be considered 'extraordinary' in the statutory sense, given the level of child support ordered and the respondent's annual income.
There was simply no evidence to support such conclusion.
Second, the order did not, in fact, come close to ordering that the appellant pay proportion of half the activities, since it excluded the cost of music lessons for the two older children.
In addition, it included the cost of Tae Kwon Do for which there was no evidence at all.
In short, such an interpretation lacks any rational basis.
Third, it is clear that, up until the argument on the appeal, the parties themselves had interpreted the order more generally, as an order that the appellant pay proportion of all the children's extra-curricular activities.
This interpretation certainly makes more sense, for the alternative would require variation in the order, or new agreement, every time the children changed or added activities.
It is unlikely that the chambers judge would have confined his order so specifically, absent, of course, an agreement of the parties, or reasonable finding that specific activity constituted an extraordinary expense.
The chambers judge erred in failing to consider the definition of extraordinary expenses in s. 7(1.1), or this Court's decision in Ryba v. Schoenroth, and acted without any evidence that the expenses in question constituted extraordinary expenses within the meaning of the Guidelines.
Accordingly, the appeal is allowed and the order of the chambers judge that the appellant pay proportion of the children's extracurricular activities is set aside.
The appellant should have the costs of the appeal.","[3, 1, 2, 4, 6, 9, 10, 5, 8, 7]"
1003,"[1] Ms. Schoenthal and Mr. Dalrymple, “the tenants,” apply pursuant to s. 49(2) of The Residential Tenancies Act[1] for leave to appeal a decision of the Court of Queen’s Bench reviewing a decision of the Rentalsman.
A Deputy Rentalsman granted an order of possession and issued a writ of possession on July 28, 2006.
Her reasons were as follows: The rent was 15 days or more in arrears when the Notice of Termination of the tenancy agreement was served and the tenant has failed to vacate the premises in accordance with the Notice.
I am satisfied that based on the evidence provided, the Landlord's claim has been sufficiently proven and that an Order should be made placing the Landlord in possession of the rental premises.
[2] The file indicates that a hearing was held on July 26 at which the tenants agreed to pay the August rent, as well as the July rent, on July 27.
The tenants dispute that they agreed to pay the August rent.
They indicate that they could not have agreed to pay the August rent on July 27 because they would not have been in a position to pay future rent on that day.
[3] The tenants advise that the landlord holds the equivalent of one month's rent as security for the payment of the last month's rent of the tenancy.","The plaintiffs wanted to build deck and glass sunroom on the back of their home.
They attended trade show and met the defendant, whose corporation had been in the business of building decks and sunrooms for 18 years.
The plaintiffs contracted with the defendant to build their sunroom.
The contract called for the provision of ten-foot deep, ten inch diameter concrete pilings to be the foundation for the deck upon which would sit glass sunroom.
This provision was fundamental element in the contract.
The type and design of the foundation was critical to the mutual satisfaction of both parties and the overall success of the installation in both the short and long term.
The contract was frustrated when it was discovered that the intended foundation could not be constructed due to the high ground water in the town of Warman and specifically on the job site.
 The plaintiffs sued the defendant for the return of their $2,200.00 deposit.
The defendant filed a dispute note and counterclaimed for a balance they believed was owed to them of $3,604.13.
HELD: There will be a judgment in favour of the plaintiffs against the defendant in the amount of $176.22.
In the circumstances, there will be no order as to costs.
Based on the facts and the applicable law, the contract was frustrated.
The frustrating event or circumstance occurred after the formation of the contract.
It was not reasonably foreseeable by either party.
The change affected the fundamental nature of the contract.
The event was permanent and non-transient.
The contract as a result would be totally different from what the parties intended.
The difference was much more than mere inconvenience.
The supervening event was beyond the control of both parties and resulted in a significant change in the original obligation assumed by them.
Both parties acted in good faith.
The plaintiffs submitted that the defendant abandoned the contract.
The court finds that the plaintiff has failed to prove that claim on a balance of probabilities.
The defendant, in its counterclaim, submitted that the plaintiffs repudiated the contract.
The court finds that the defendant (plaintiff in the counterclaim) failed to prove that claim on a balance of probabilities.
Considering all the facts presented in the case, the court finds that a just and reasonable resolution demands that the value of the expenses lost due to the frustration of the contract should be borne by the parties on a 65/35 ratio: the defendant should bear 65% of the loss, and the plaintiffs should bear 35% of the loss.
The plaintiffs and the defendant were not on an equal plane.
The plaintiffs relied on the contractor's experience to some degree, although not entirely.
The defendant corporation may be able to further mitigate its losses over the course of time by using more parts salvaged from the material left over in the failed project.
Further, the corporation will be able to write off this loss over the course of time.","[3, 4, 2, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]"

The petitioner seeks to increase access to the two children of the relationship and an order to address holiday periods not covered in the previous order.
HELD: There shall be no change in the previously ordered access schedule.
 The Court found no change in the material circumstances that would warrant a change in the petitioner's regular access schedule.
Because of the petitioner's work schedule, the increased access is unlikely to result in any meaningful time with the children.
The holiday access requested was in the nature of an extrapolation of the previous order and the Court ordered holiday access in such a fashion as to continue that order.","[1, 6, 0, 5, 11, 7, 13, 12, 8, 17, 19, 18, 2, 21, 14, 16, 9]"

KOSKIE - for the respondentJUDGMENT DICKSON J.
DATE: NOVEMBER 17, 1994The applicant (wife) seeks an interim distribution of matrimonial property and interim support for her two children, ages 16 and 13, and an order prohibiting the respondent (husband) from contacting her and from going to her home or her workplace.
In May of this year, an interim order granted the wife exclusive possession of the parties' farm home with the exception of ""the tool shed and other parts of the farm yard which the husband is required to enter for the purpose of doing his farming"".
Both parties were ordered to have no contact with the other and the husband was ordered to pay $2,000.00 lump sum support for the children at the end of the 1994 harvest.
It appears that the husband undertook to pay periodic child support if he got a job off the farm.
An earlier consent order forbade the husband from disposing of matrimonial property.
Since then, the wife says her husband has continued to dispose of farm machinery and the 1994 crops.","The appellant appeals his conviction for common assault under s. 266 of the Criminal Code on the basis that his non-lawyer agent, Richard Klassen, provided him with ineffective assistance resulting in a miscarriage of justice.
HELD: The appeal is dismissed.
1) Klassen's lack of ability by itself is not a ground for determining that a miscarriage of justice occurred.
There was no unfairness in the trial process.
The appellant was entitled to have Klassen represent him.
He made that decision freely based on information fully at hand that he consciously chose to rely on.
There was no procedural unfairness to the appellant.
He did not get the standard of representation that a competent lawyer could provide but that came as a result of the decisions he freely made.
On appeal the appellant cannot rely on the fact that the standard of representation received was not equal to that of a competent lawyer.
2) The tactical decision to attack the credibility of the complainant through challenge to the audio tape was personally approved by the appellant.
The appellant saw many lawyers in the assault case.
He did not have confidence in them and pursued his original line of defence through Klassen.
The Court cannot see a miscarriage of justice as a result of the tactics of the appellant and Klassen.
The evidence at trial and the fresh evidence offered by the appellant's testimony and his affidavit to not establish a miscarriage of justice that may have occurred outside of the appellant's choice of agent, which is the test in R. v.

Each of the parties had significant assets at the time of the marriage which have increased in value since that date.

5)If the husband does not or cannot resume a livestock operation on the farm once he takes possession then the entire farm assets save the Oldsmobile car shall be sold, the debts paid and the balance of the proceeds from such sale, if any, shall be divided between the parties.
The petitioner (husband) did not pursue a livestock operation on the farm for a number of reasons, one of which being the fact that he required surgery on his back making it impossible for him to physically do the work.
In addition his financial circumstances, which were dismal at the time of my judgment, became even worse in 1994 and as a result he made a voluntary assignment into bankruptcy on February 14, 1994.
As a result a hearing date was set for May 13 at which I was asked in accordance with my prior judgment to complete the division of matrimonial property.
In addition the petitioner filed a motion seeking a variation of the spousal maintenance order I made in November in light of his bankrupt financial situation and his inability to earn any income at this time.","An unrepresented university student appealed his conviction for uttering threats after he sent an email to his computer science professor requesting his assistance to de-bug a program contained in an attachment.
The attachment was text file with lot of extra characters, including messages that read 'good job, but am going to kill you' and 'I am so horny.'
Although the professor had not taken the content of the attachment as threat, he had sent it on to university officials as he had been requested to alert them to any odd or unusual behaviour by the student.
The student later advised the professor that he had typed the messages because he thought someone was monitoring what he was typing and he was trying to get reaction out of them.
He also testified that he had not intended to send that particular attachment to the professor.
Appeal allowed; conviction quashed.
The trial judge erred in permitting inadmissible evidence to be adduced from the university administration to the effect that the accused had a psychiatric illness and, in failing to intervene when the Crown assumed that the student had put his character in issue and cross-examined him as to alleged prior acts of misconduct and other extraneous matters, the cumulative effect of which was fatal to the trial judge's findings of credibility.
The case against the student was entirely circumstantial and it was equally open to infer that the words had been typed in the file to get a reaction from people that the student, rationally or otherwise, believed to be monitoring his keystrokes and did not constitute a threat to cause death to the professor.","[1, 0, 2, 6, 11, 12, 7, 10, 9]"

The indictment was amended on July 27, 2007, by consent, to read ""153(1)(a)"" rather than ""153(a)"".
An authorization to intercept private communications was obtained from a Provincial Court judge.
The complainant consented to the procedure and did in fact contact the accused and engage him in a conversation that was surreptitiously intercepted by the police.
[4] A transcript of the conversation was made.
Both the Crown and the accused agreed that the transcript was an accurate transcription of the telephone conversation and that, for the purposes of this application, a decision could be made on the basis of the transcription without the necessity of playing the actual recording in court.
ISSUES[5] The accused raises three arguments.
These arguments can be summarized as follows:1.
The evidence of the conversation is inadmissible because it is irrelevant.
2.
The authorization to intercept private communications provides that the offences in which private communications may be intercepted were ss.
271(1) and 273.1(2)(c) of the Criminal Code, R.S.C.","The mother applied for retroactive support (table amounts and s. 7 expenses) for two adult children.
The father resisted the application in relation to the oldest son on the basis that he was no longer a dependant child when it was filed.
The evidence showed the son finished university before the application was filed.
His graduation took place after, at which time he was already working full time and living with his girlfriend.
He lived with his mother for few months because of relationship problems, but later moved back in with the girlfriend.
He also received some assistance from his parents when he took time off work to retrain.
The father felt the mother's application in relation to the younger son should be limited because of her unreasonable delay in making it.
He argued retroactivity should be limited to three years from the date he received the application (months after it was filed).
The mother argued formal notice was given when her lawyer sent a letter requesting additional support several years earlier.
She asked the court for support retroactive to three years before that date, or longer (based on what she alleged was blameworthy conduct on the father's part).
The evidence showed the mother was slow in responding to the father's request for particulars.
Despite threatening legal action several times, it took her years to file the application.
The wife's application for retroactive support in relation to the oldest son dismissed.
He was no longer a child of the marriage when it was filed.
He became independent when his schooling finished and he started working and living with his girlfriend.
While his parents provided assistance during his relationship troubles and retraining, they did so voluntarily and not out of any legal obligation.
Support for the younger son to be reassessed retroactive to three years from the date the application was filed (as opposed to received).
The mother unreasonably delayed her claim by allowing it to languish for years.
While normally the letter from her lawyer would be said to constitute effective notice, the notice here was voided by the mother's failure to prosecute the matter.
The father did not engage in blameworthy conduct: he made efforts to respond to and settle the mother's claims; he paid a significant level of support; and he reasonably believed he was meeting his obligations.
Here, the need for certainty for a payor parent weighs in favour of the father.","[1, 7, 6, 13, 4, 9, 10, 14, 0, 20, 11, 19, 15, 16, 12]"

The respondent was sentenced to 90 days secure custody, 45 days community supervision, one year probation and a 10 year firearms prohibition.

The defendant Renouf is Burrows' friend.
As favour, Renouf attended the property while Burrows was away and cut down some trees that he was asked to cut.
He went on to cut down several others that he felt were diseased/damaged. eventually realizing he had crossed the property line and cut down more than 17 of the claimants' trees.
The claimants sued for the cost of replacing the trees with a comparable number of mature trees, the cost of removing the felled trees and to recoup for anticipated damage to their septic field.
At issue was: 1. whether Renouf trespassed; 2. whether Burrows was liable for Renouf's actions (for 'hiring' Renouf or because they were engaged in a joint enterprise); and 3. damages.
The claimants did not want Burrows helping with the tree removal, even if doing so would save money.
1. Renouf trespassed on the claimants' land and is liable for damages.
That it was an honest mistake is irrelevant since trespass does not require bad faith or improper purpose.
2. Burrows is not liable.
He was not Renouf's employer, nor were Renouf's actions foreseeable.
It was a favour and Renouf went way beyond the scope of what he was asked to do.
Burrows is not responsible for everything that flowed from their limited enterprise.
The case law requires a degree of blameworthiness (a neglectful or unlawful enterprise) which creates a foreseeable risk of harm.
3. Renouf to pay the claimants: $3,750 to replace the trees with young, native trees (half the amount sought by the claimants), $2,000 for tree removal (half the quote submitted by the claimants since they refused to mitigate the damage by allowing Burrows to help).
While Burrows had counterclaimed for damages arising from a confrontation between the claimants and his son, he did not seriously pursue it and it was dismissed.
Costs of $1,234 awarded to the claimants (including $960.77 for disbursements).
While the amount seems high, the case was large one and the counterclaim, although not seriously pursued, hung over the claimants' heads as they prepared for trial.","[2, 6, 4, 0, 7, 5, 9, 1, 8, 10, 11]"

for Royal Bank Application:From: Q.B.","This appeal concerns the assessment for municipal purposes of a building located in the City of Regina and used commercially as an enclosed shopping mall.
The building was assessed in each of the years 2003 and 2004 on the basis of its 'fair value' as determined by the City Assessor.
The owner of the building, the corporate appellant, was dissatisfied with the Assessor's determination of fair value and appealed the assessment to the local Board of Revision, then to the Assessment Appeals Committee of the Saskatchewan Municipal board.
The appeals were allowed in part, but the corporate appellant remained dissatisfied.
It applied for leave to appeal to this Court pursuant to s. 33.1 of The Municipal Board Act.
The issues on appeal all relate to the determination of the fair value of the building and, more particularly, to the market adjustment factor used in that determination.
The grounds take issue one way or another with the inclusion of the sales of the Southland and Victoria Square Malls in the array of sales from which the MAF was derived, or alternatively, with the adjustment of the sale price of these properties.
HELD: Appeal dismissed.
The appeal in relation to the treatment of the sale of the Victoria Square Mall fails, as does the appeal concerning the sale of the Southland Mall.
The Court notes that other companies, owning or operating similar malls, also took issue with their 2003 and 2004 assessments.

They too were granted leave to appeal to this Court on the same grounds as the appellant in this case.

1011,"Q.B.
A.D. 1987 No.
March 17, 1987The respondent, a justice of the peace, issued a search warrant to search a dwelling house for weapons allegedly used in an attempted armed robbery.
The applicants seek an order quashing the warrant on the grounds:... that the said Search Warrant was unlawfully and invalidly issued in excess of the jurisdiction of the Respondent for the following reasons:(1) The INFORMATION sworn in support of the application for the said Search Warrant failed to disclose the existence of reasonable and probable grounds to believe that the items sought to be seized would be found at the location which was to be the subject of the search; more particularly, and without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the said Information was deficient in the following respects:(a) The sole ground upon which the Information is based is hearsay information from a confidential source and no details are provided in support of the informant's opinion or conclusion that such information is reliable.
Furthermore the informant fails to pledge on oath as to his belief in the accuracy of the source of confidential information, and therefore, no reliance could have been placed thereon by the Respondent in determining whether reasonable and probable grounds existed for the issuance of the Warrant.
IThe search warrant was issued pursuant to the provisions of s. 443 of the Criminal Code.","This is an appeal from a judgment in which the trial judge held that the sale of farm land by the then 79 year old appellant was valid and that her solicitor in the transaction was not negligent.
The appellant widow agreed to sell four quarters of farmland, including residence and some grain bins on the land, to the respondents by lease option agreement.
The total price was $120,000.
The terms were favourable to the purchasers, the monies being paid over years with most deferred until the final year.
There was no interest.
However, the appellant was permitted to reside in the house for her lifetime if she paid the utilities and the property taxes.
The trial judge noted that the appellant resided on the land for years and there was no complaint made until the appellant's daughter, from whom the contract had been concealed by joint agreement between the appellant and the purchasers, found out what had happened.
The sole issue on appeal was the applicable standard of review in H.L. v. Canada (Attorney General) [2005] 1 S.C.R. 401.
HELD: Appeal dismissed.
1) There is no doubt that the central facts as found by the trial judge regarding the contract, the competence of the appellant and the relationship with and the conduct of the purchasers was supported by probative evidence.
It is impossible for an appeal court to interfere with those findings, even if the Court had wished to.
2) With regard to the allegation of negligence against appellant's lawyer, contrary to what the appellant suggest, an independent meeting is not absolutely necessary for the solicitor to ensure comprehension of the contract.
It is of course desirable, but the critical matter is for the solicitor to satisfy himself that the client comprehends the transaction.
The trial judge found that the appellant understood all aspects of the contract.
The matter of the timing of the private meeting between the appellant and her lawyer is not relevant, given that the appellant after the meeting continued to be prepared to enter into and perform the contract.
If she had manifested some unease after she signed the agreement and then met with her lawyer but before the delivery of the contract to the purchasers, other issues and no doubt other evidence would have been considered in determining when the contract became effective in the circumstances.
The claims against the appellant's solicitor are without a factual basis.","[0, 1, 3, 6, 5, 4]"

THE FACTS:[3] The Complainant born [in 1989], is now fifteen years of age and is in Grade Nine.
She has known the Respondent for a considerable period of time and has stayed over at his house alone with him.
The original connection was her mother’s boyfriend is the Respondent’s nephew.

The issues are whether the plaintiffs are precluded from recovery against the defendant by virtue of the contractual term acknowledging the equipment to be water resistant only as well as the posted disclaimers to this effect.
HELD: The plaintiff shall have judgment for $250 plus costs of issuing the claim and service.
1) Notwithstanding that the plaintiff signed the rental contract acknowledging that the equipment was not waterproof and only water resistant, it appears from the last three sentences of the inspection report that water was entering at the corners of the door by virtue of the door not sitting flat at the corners.
This defect would have permitted excess water to enter prior to being cleaned.
Perfection could not be expected since it was acknowledged that the rental unit was not waterproof and some seepage may be expected even after the door had been fixed.
Nonetheless, the sealing problem would have taken it beyond the acknowledgment of the unit being only water resistant.
2) The plaintiff acknowledges that the truck remained parked outside in heavy rainfall for two days and nights prior to being unloaded.
This exacerbated the scope of the damage claimed since the water would have continued to seep in unabated for roughly six times as long as the trip itself took.
The Court concludes that the defendant is only 20% responsible for the damages sustained to the plaintiff's possessions.","[0, 2, 3, 7, 8, 1, 12, 10, 11, 9]"

They were also shown pictures of the accused who was likely driving white Tempo.
The search revealed marijuana grow-op.
The accused was later seen by officers driving.
The officers chased the Tempo for 41 kms, but the vehicle was driven into the ditch, and the driver escaped on foot.
Four years later the accused was arrested in British Columbia and brought to trial.
The accused was convicted of three drug offences and two driving offences following a jury trial.
He was sentenced to a total of 35 months in prison.
The accused appeal both the convictions and the sentence.
HELD: The accused argued the convictions were unreasonable and not supported by the evidence.
The grounds were: (a) the officer's eye witness identification evidence cannot support a conviction; (b) the trial judge made inappropriate comments about whether the accused could have outrun the officer at the end of the car chase, if he was the driver; (c) an adverse inference should been drawn from the Crown's failure to call the second officer; (d) the trial judge's treatment of the photographs of the accused misled the jury about what had to be proven to establish the accused was driving the Tempo; (e) the jury was improperly lead to place reliance on an assessment of a witness's credibility made by an officer who questioned him about his possible involvement in the grow-op.
The Court found: (a) the jury was alerted to the frailties of the officer's identification evidence, and the convictions were not unreasonable in light of the evidence as a whole; (b) it was open to the jury to consider whether the accused could have outrun the officer, and the judge's caution about changes in physical condition over time put the issue into a proper perspective; (c) the judge told the jury that it could draw an adverse inference from the Crown's failure to call the second officer, but the decision lies with the jury and the judge is not obliged to tell the jury that it must draw the inference; (d) when the charge is considered as a whole, the jury was not left with the impression that if it concluded the pictures were of the accused that it somehow followed that he was the driver of the Tempo; (e) the judge's remarks did not improperly influence the jury's assessment of the witness's credibility.
The imposed sentences fall within the standard range for similar offences and were not demonstrably unfit.","[3, 2, 1, 9, 8, 11, 10, 6, 7, 13, 4]"

[2] I spent a good part of last evening reviewing the contents of both your briefs, and my problems this morning arise from the manner in which the application was initiated and with the arguments that were raised in those briefs.
[3] The application says that it is for determination of a question of law pursuant to C.P.
Rule 25.01.
Unfortunately, it does not say what the question of law is.
The application was also for directions as to procedure to govern the future course of conduct of trial, in the alternative to determination of the question of law and, secondly, to dismiss the action because Nova Scotia is a forum non conveniens.
The problem is that the applicants appear to have argued determination of question of law, but the respondent has argued forum non conveniens, or at least has focused on them.","Fulltext of judgment follows:
Following the conviction of the respondent on a charge of trafficking in morphine contrary to section 5(1) of the Controlled Drugs and Substances Act, the prosecutor asked the sentencing judge to make a DNA order under section 487.051(3) of the Criminal Code.
The judge declined to do so for the reason this was the respondent's first drug offence and she had no record of violence.
With respect, we are of the opinion the judge erred in declining to make the order.
The error lay in the judge's failure to have regard for the offender's record as a wholeÃ¹she has 53 prior convictionsÃ¹and to have adequate regard for the objectives of section 487.051 as identified in R. v. Briggs 2001 CanLII 24113 (ON C.A.), (2001), 45 C.R. (5th) 99 (Ont. C.A.).
In light of the nature of the respondent's current offence, her lengthy record, her history of recidivism, and the relatively modest impact an order would have on her privacy and security interests, we are satisfied an order should have been made.
Accordingly, and in the best interests of the administration of justice, there will be an order under section 487.051(3) in Form 5.04 for the taking of bodily samples from the respondent.
If any directions should be required in relation to the execution of the order, the parties are given leave to informally apply for such directions through the Registrar's office.","[2, 3, 5, 4, 8, 1, 0, 7]"

The appellants wish to add as a ground of appeal that the respondent, the plaintiff in the main action, is not a “lawful plaintiff” and, therefore, not entitled to security for costs.
This point was raised before the chambers judge in the Supreme Court and is referred to in his reasons.","Defence sought an adjournment of a preliminary hearing to call a police accident reconstructionist as a witness.

The Crown advised defence that the officer was out of the country on peace keeping mission.
The officer was expected back within months of the commencement of the preliminary hearing.

The defendant was not satisfied with the plaintiff's work, hired a third party to fix the plaintiff's work and refused to pay the plaintiff.

HELD: The plaintiff's claim is dismissed.
The Court found enough evidence to conclude that the central purpose of the contract for installation was not achieved and that there was a breach of the implied condition that it would be performed in a workmanlike standard.
As the plaintiff's workmanship constitutes a breach of contract, the defendant's damages are set off against the claim.","[2, 5, 8, 4, 11, 6, 14, 12, 15, 19, 10, 7, 17, 9]"

Goreham, 2008 NSPC 5Date: January 31, 2008 Docket: 1697424 Registry: Yarmouth Between: Her Majesty the Queenv.Robert Terry Goreham Judge: The Honourable Judge James H. BurrillHeard: January 31, 2008, in Barrington, Nova Scotia Charge: 287(2) MVACounsel: Jim Fyfe, for the Crown Philip Star, Q.C., for the Defence By the Court:[1] On August 9, 2006, Robert Terry Goreham was observed by police officers driving his all terrain vehicle (ATV) along Highway #3 in the community of Woods Harbour, Nova Scotia.
At the time his driver’s license was revoked.
These facts were agreed and the only issue at this trial is whether this makes the accused guilty of the offence of driving a motor vehicle on the highway while his license was revoked contrary to s.287(2) of the Motor Vehicle Act.
[2] The Crown argues that because Mr. Goreham was driving a motor vehicle on a highway and his “driver’s license” was revoked he is guilty of the offence.
[3] The Defence argues that it is not that simple.
It is argued that since there is no nexus between his driving of the ATV and the revocation of his driver’s license he should be found not guilty of this offence.","The accused plead guilty to one count of using credit card data to fraudulently obtain services contrary to s. 342(3) of the Criminal Code, one count of fraud over $5,000 contrary to s. 380(1) of the Criminal Code for defrauding Sasktel of telephone services and one count of fraudulently personating various persons with intent to gain advantage for himself contrary to s. 403(a) of the Criminal Code.
The accused was incarcerated at the time that he committed the offences.
The accused opened 52 false accounts with Sasktel, at times using names he obtained from obituaries and at other times using fictious names.
He then used the accounts to obtain telephone services.
The total loss to Sasktel was $25,915.44.
The second scheme involved obtaining credit card information from people outside the prison, ordering goods via telephone to be delivered to third party and using the fraudulent credit cards to pay for the items.
The total loss to the credit card companies was $22,695.18.
The accused was 47 years old and had spent much of the last 30 years in jail.
He had 121 prior convictions on his record, mostly for fraud, property related offences and non-compliance with court orders.
In addition to the financial losses, huge amount of resources were expended to investigate the accused's activities.
He plead guilty.
HELD: A fit sentence in global terms for these offences would be 8 years and 6 months.
The accused was given credit for 4 years and 9 months for the time he spent in custody.
The accused was sentenced to 2 years and 3 months for the s. 342(3) offence, 1 year and 6 months consecutive for the offence under s. 380(1) and 2 years concurrent for the personation offence under s. 403(a).
The Court gave the accused double credit for remand time that was the result of system delays, but imposed 1:1 credit for the 393 days of remand time that were attributable to the accused.
The Court held that the high dollar value involved, the pre-meditation and planning involved, the lengthy period of time over which the accused committed the offences, the number of transactions involved and the fact that the accused committed these offences from prison were aggravating factors.
In mitigation, the accused offered a guilty plea.
The primary factors to be emphasized were denunciation and deterrence.","[2, 0, 3, 1, 4, 6]"

& J. Scott Barnett Stewart McKelvey Stirling Scales for the ApplicantW. Bruce Gillis, Q.C., Durland Gillis Parker & Richter for the Respondents [1] The Applicant land developer after applying for but failing to receive final subdivision approval looks to the Court for relief including:a.
An order in the nature of certiorari quashing the development officer’s decision that the application was incomplete,b.
A declaration that the application is in fact complete, andc. An order of mandamus directing the development officer to issue the final approval.
BACKGROUND[2] The facts are neither complicated nor in dispute.
The Applicant owns a large tract of land surrounding Lower Lake Sixty in Annapolis County.
In the summer of 1996, the Applicant began the process of first consolidating and then subdividing this land into approximately 25 lots.
The Applicant applied for tentative subdivision approval in October of 1997 and received the same on March 16, 1998.
[3] After several initial attempts the Applicant submitted its last plan for final approval on March 14, 2000.
The next day, the application was determined by the development officer to be incomplete for essentially two reasons:1.
The Applicant, therefore, takes issue with the development officer’s decision to declare the application incomplete and looks to this Court for relief.","The appellant was convicted of impaired care and control and acquitted of a charge of care and control with a blood alcohol level exceeding .08 because of Charter violations.
The appellant was senior member of the Saskatoon Police Force who was charged by members of his police force.
The trial judge based his conviction on the evidence of two officers who testified that they observed signs of impairment including bloodshot, red eyes, flushed face, slurred speech, strong smell of alcohol on his breath and dry lips and mouth.
In convicting the accused, the trial judge rejected the evidence of third officer who testified that the only sign of impairment he noted on scene was that the appellant had alcohol on his breath.
The issues on appeal were whether the trial judge erred in his treatment of the evidence of the third officer, whether the trial judge erred in considering the observations of the other two officers as evidence to be admitted on the impaired driving count and whether the conviction for impaired driving was an unsafe verdict.
HELD: The appeal was dismissed.
The trial judge did not ignore or reject the evidence of the third officer.
He provided extensive reasons why he preferred the evidence of the other two officers to the evidence of the third officer.
The trial judge is in special position to assess the credibility of witnesses by being able to observe the witnesses as they testify and compare their observations to the testimony of the other witnesses.
The findings of fact in regard to the testimony of the three police officers are supported by the transcript of their evidence and do not amount to conjecture of speculation.
The trial judge made express findings of credibility with respect to the two officers and preferred their evidence to that of the third officer.
There is no inherent improbability that would justify interference with the trial judge's findings on credibility.
The appellant argued that the officer's evidence that the appellant had slurred speech should have been excluded because the trial judge excluded the actual statements made by the accused as violation of the accused's Charter rights under s. 10(b).
Slurred speech is known physical indicator of impairment absent evidence of another cause.
While statements made by an accused may not be introduced to prove impairment unless the accused has been advised of his Charter rights, physical manifestation such as slurred speech may be introduced to prove evidence of impairment.
The appellant's argument that the verdict is unsafe or unreasonable was also rejected.
The trial judge concluded that the Crown had proven beyond a reasonable doubt that there was evidence of impairment sufficient to meet the standard in R. v. Stellato.
There was no palpable or overriding error in the verdict.","[3, 4, 0, 5, 2, 8, 10, 11, 7, 6, 16]"

CROMWELL, J.A.
: I.
Introduction:Disputes arising from collective agreements must be resolved through the grievance and arbitration process.
The main issue here is whether this principle applies to bar the union's lawsuit in this case.
II.
Overview of the Facts and Proceedings:There have, as yet, been no findings of fact in this case.
The following are assumed to be true for the purpose of these proceedings.
The appellant is an employer and the respondent a union.
By successorship, they are parties to a collective agreement signed on July 22, 1994 with effect from January 1, 1994 to December 31, 1996.
The successorship is not relevant to the issues on appeal and for convenience I will refer to the parties as the employer and union as if they were the original parties to the collective agreement.
The employer and the union seemed to have adverted to the impact of this legislation on the collective agreement.","In the evening, the accused inmate and his two co-accused inmates placed themselves in close proximity to the complainant inmate at table at the Penitentiary.
The co-accused threw hot liquid from the cup directly into the complainant's face and the three inmates commenced stabbing the complainant with weapon.
second complainant inmate attempted to intervene to assist the first complainant and the accused and co-accused began to stab the second complainant.
The first complainant suffered severe first and second degree burns to his face and to his shoulders as well as numerous puncture wounds and lacerations but was not critically injured.
The accused was charged with aggravated assault on the first complainant and common assault on the second complainant.
None of the inmates testified at trial other than the accused.
The accused testified that he felt he was being shunned in the Block and had received threats from the first complainant and others in the complainant's group who were brandishing shanks earlier that day.
The defence argued that the Crown failed to prove that the injuries caused to the first complainant fell within the definition of 'wound, maim, disfigure or endanger life'; and that the acts done to the first and second complainants were in self-defence as contemplated by s. 34 of the Criminal Code.
HELD: The accused was convicted of both counts.
1) In relation to the accused's defence of self-defence pursuant to s. 34(2) pertaining to the first complainant, the Court found the accused did not believe that he was being assaulted within the meaning of the law and, even if he did hold this belief, such a belief was not reasonable in the circumstances.
Further, the Court did not accept, on a subjective or objective basis, that the accused reasonably believed that the first complainant had the present ability to carry out the threat, notwithstanding that the physical aspect of the assault need not be imminent or immediate.
Lastly, the Court found that the accused did not believe that he had no other option.
The accused admitted that he had other options but chose not to avail himself of them.
2) The Court found it did not need to assess the application of s. 37 of the Code in relation to the common assault charge.
Rather, the Court found s. 27 of the Code applicable and determined that the second complainant was legally justified to use as much force as was reasonably necessary to prevent the commission of an offence which would be arrestable without warrant.
The Court found the second complainant was clothed in legal justification and the accused was not entitled to the protection of s. 34(1) because the accused provoked the assault, and the force he used was more than necessary to defend himself as the accused was armed with a shank and the second complainant was not.","[8, 3, 7, 0, 10, 12, 6, 11, 4, 1, 5, 9, 15, 13, 19, 2]"

A pre‑hearing conference in this matter was held Tuesday, the 14th of January, 1992, where agreement was reached that today the court would address the following:1. the defence application to remove Charles D. Lienaux as solicitor in the plaintiff's application filed December 2nd, 1991;2.
If Charles D. Lienaux were removed, should he be permitted to address the defendant's further application to strike the original application, which consists of the originating notice interlocutory (inter partes) and Charles D. Lienaux's affidavit in support of the plaintiff's original application, sworn the 27th day of November, 1991, and filed the 2nd of December, 1991?
Prior to the hearing, Mr. Lienaux indicated a willingness to withdraw as solicitor for the plaintiff's application of December 2nd, 1991, but continue on the defence application to strike.
The application by the defendant for the court to order Charles Lienaux to remove himself as solicitor for the plaintiff in his application filed December 2nd, 1991, is supported by the intervenor.
This application in itself seeks declarations and relief against the defendant and the solicitor in the employ of the defendant, the Attorney General of Nova Scotia.","The complainant and the accused were in relationship and came to Regina where they stayed in hotel, drank, consumed cocaine and shopped.

The accused was charged with two counts of uttering death threats to the complainant; unlawfully confining the complainant; assault causing bodily harm on the complainant; committing sexual assault on the complainant; breach of recognizance in having contact with the complainant.
At trial, both the complainant and the accused testified as to what transpired during the argument that resulted in the charges.
HELD: 1) The accused was found not guilty of sexual assault.
2) The accused was found guilty of unlawful confinement.
3) The accused was found guilty of assault causing bodily harm.
The Court did not accept the accused's invoking of self-defence pursuant to s. 34(1) of the Criminal Code.
The accused admitted to striking the complainant with a closed fist five times as hard as he could and the force used was excessive.
4) The accused was found guilty of threatening to kill the complainant at the hotel.

:This is an appeal from a decision of Mr. Justice Kelly in the Supreme Court which held that the action herein by the appellant is barred by s. 18 of the Workers' Compensation Act R.S.
1989, c. 508.
The appellant was employed by MacKenzies Eastern Transport Limited.
MacKenzies carried on business in a commercial warehouse at Musquodoboit Harbour owned by the respondent and leased to MacKenzie.
On October 7, 1991 the appellant, while in the course of her employment was struck by tile which fell from the office ceiling.
MacKenzies and the respondent were employers under Part 1 of the Workers' Compensation Act.
The appellant received benefits under the Act.
The appellant commenced the present action against the respondent for damages with the consent of the Workers' Compensation Board.","The accused was charged with sexual assault and various other sexual offences with respect to his niece (who had spent weekends and summers with her father, who lived with his sister and the accused) when she was between the ages of 12 to 15.
The accused denied the allegations, suggesting that, since the niece had not disclosed any of these matters until she was 17 years old, she had made up generalized allegation against him to stop her boyfriend from breaking up with her and then found it necessary to maintain the lie, tell her friends, her mother and the police and get more specific when pressed for details.
He also argued that she was not credible because her testimony in court was inconsistent with that in the preliminary inquiry and although there were numerous persons she could have confided in at the time, she never told anybody about the alleged incidents but kept going back to visit her father.
Accused found guilty of all counts.
Although she was at times frustrated and unable to recall precisely, the niece's demeanour was consistent with a young person doing her best to be truthful and accurate in intimidating and embarrassing circumstances.
Her evidence was both consistent with that of other witnesses and internally consistent and the inconsistencies with her previous statements were minor.
The court found she had no motive to lie initially or during her trial testimony and the reality was that by making these allegations, she knew her father would be forced to move and would become estranged from his sister, her family would be fractured and the 'sister'-like relationship she had with the accused's daughter would end.","[0, 2, 1, 3, 5, 6, 4, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14]"

Included in the fifty‑five schools are six school buildings leased by the Cape Breton Board from the Catholic Episcopal Corporation of Antigonish or other entities of the Roman Catholic Church (the ""Church"").
It is the responsibility for payment of the leasing cost on these six school buildings that is now before the Court.
The issue is whether the Respondent, the Minister of Education (the ""Minister"") is required to reimburse the Cape Breton Board for the costs incurred by the Cape Breton Board in leasing these school buildings from the Church.
Following a Province wide amalgamation of school boards in January of 1982, the Cape Breton Board assumed leasing responsibilities for the six school buildings and in 1983, entered into various leasing arrangements for the buildings, pursuant to the authority provided in s. 33(7)(d) of the Education Act 1987, R.S.N.S.
Unlike subsections (a) and (b) of s. 33(7) which deal with other school board powers, no approval of the Minister is required under subsection (d) before the Cape Breton Board may enter into a lease.
In the instant, the Cape Breton Board did, however, seek the approval of the Minister, not for the leasing itself but to ensure the Minister would permit the expenditure of capital funds on these leased facilities.","The applicant applied for judicial interim release under s. 20(b) of the Extradition Act and s. 679 of the Criminal Code.
Romania sought extradition of the applicant so that he might serve a 3 year prison sentence imposed as a result of a conviction in Romania for criminally negligent homicide with respect to a motor vehicle collision where the accused, while impaired, hit a pedestrian and killed him.
The applicant offered surety from the Romania community in Saskatchewan who did not appear to have known the accused for long and offered to put up his car as bond.
The applicant had common law spouse in Saskatchewan but owned no real property.
HELD: Although the Crown conceded that the applicant had met the relatively low threshold of showing that his application for leave to appeal his extradition order was not frivolous,
the Court of Appeal declined to release the applicant.
The Court of Appeal held that there is an elevated risk of flight in light of the fact that the applicant has exhausted all appeals in Romania and is facing a 3 year prison sentence.
Canada's international obligations in extradition proceedings require the Court to look more severely at the risk of non-appearance than it would if the application was made solely under s. 679 in respect of criminal proceeding in Canada.
The sureties offered by the applicant were not sufficient to ensure his attendance at Court.

However, I would not have had time to do that this month and it is in the best interests of the parties that they know the outcome and my basis for arriving at the following conclusions.
In that way, should the unsuccessful party wish to appeal my decision or should a transcript of these proceedings be required for any ancillary matters in Ontario, that could be arranged in short order.
I glean the following summary of the facts from the pleadings.
The plaintiff complains that the defendant failed to conduct the detailed analysis it undertook and that any recommendations were superficial and of no help to the plaintiff.
On the hearing yesterday, I had the benefit of lengthy arguments from Messrs. Latimer for the defendant, and Stobie for the plaintiff.
A typed statement confirming two agreements reached by counsel was filed.
I also gave leave to Mr. Stobie to tender an Affidavit sworn by Mr. Weld, March 8, 1995.
By Interlocutory Notice filed March 2, 1995, the defendant applied, pursuant to Civil Procedure Rule 12.06, to set aside the default judgment.","The accused plead guilty to one count of aggravated assault, a breach of undertaking for failure to keep the peace and be of good behaviour and failing to comply with a condition of a youth sentence by failing to report to his youth worker.
The victim came out of his house because he was concerned that someone was trying to damage his vehicle.
The victim had baseball bat when he confronted the accused and group of young people.
One of the accused's friends was pushed and fell backwards hitting his head.
The accused said the victim hit him on the back with the bat.
The accused got the bat and hit the victim five times in the head.
The accused and another youth also kicked the victim while he was down.
After the assault, the accused and his friends fled, leaving the victim in the alley.
The victim suffered serious injuries including shattered jaw, every bone in his face was broken, his skull was fractured and he suffered brain bleed and lost teeth.
He is also going to lose his eye, has memory loss and had to sell his business because he cannot work.
The Crown applied to have the offence declared a serious violent offence and sought a sentence of 24 months, being 16 months secure custody followed by 8 months community supervision.
At the time of the offence the accused was 17 years and months of age.
He identified as Metis youth, but had no connection to cultural activities and claimed he had not been subjected to racism or poverty.
His parents were separated.
He was not attending school or working at the time of the offence.
He had an extensive criminal record including 17 entries for compliance related convictions, previous property related convictions, for obstructing police offences and one for uttering threats.
He had served five open custody sentences.
HELD: The offence was declared a serious violent offence.
The victim will be significantly and permanently disabled as a result of the offence and there can be no doubt that the accused caused intentional and grievous bodily harm to the victim.
The court held that the egregious nature of the assault, serious harm done to the victim and the fact that the youth was subject to release conditions with respect to a weapons offence at the time he committed the assault were aggravating factors.
In mitigation, the accused had entered a guilty plea, was cooperative with the police investigation, had done well in pre-sentence detention and had expressed remorse for his actions by submitting an apology letter to the court.
The accused was sentenced to 24 months secure custody followed by 18 months probation.
He was given 2:1 credit for the time he was on remand, leaving 18 months custody of closed custody to serve of which 12 months would be actual custody and 6 months would be community supervision.
The court held that a lengthy custodial sentence was necessary to provide meaningful consequences and to achieve meaningful progress for the accused.
A period of secure custody and supervision would give the accused access to psychological counselling and programming, an opportunity to work on his education and a chance to engage with support services in the community prior to release from custody.
Given the accused's violent response in this case, it was clear that intensive programming is required.","[3, 7, 6, 4, 12, 5, 0, 1, 15, 17, 16, 22]"

The reasons for judgment of the Court were delivered orally by:CLARKE, C.J.N.S.
:This is an appeal from the conviction of the appellant that on March 11, 1995, he broke and entered a used car dealership office in Antigonish and committed the offense of theft of a 1994 Chev Blazer contrary to s. 348(1)(b) of the Criminal Code.
A passing motorist familiar with the Blazer saw it being driven from the lot at 12:15 o'clock in the morning.
He informed the police who, upon finding the office had been broken into and the Blazer keys were missing, took chase.
They came upon the Blazer on the highway.
When it was stopped two persons exited the Blazer and ran away.
Two constables followed the tracks of one of them in the snow through a wooded area.","The accused was charged with impaired driving and driving over .08.
He argued that the investigating officer did not have reasonable and probable grounds to make a breath demand pursuant to s. 254(3) of the Criminal Code resulting in the arbitrary detention of the accused.
The accused argued the Certificate of Analysis should be excluded.
The officer responded to complaint of possible impaired driver weaving on the roadway and onto the sidewalk.
The officer located vehicle with the same licence plate number.
He observed the vehicle weaving from right to left in its lane.
The vehicle braked suddenly and made right turn from the left lane.
The officer activated his emergency equipment.
The vehicle pulled over quickly but lurched forward and stopped abruptly as the officer walked towards the vehicle.
The accused had glossy eyes, slurred speech, poor muscular control, difficulty extracting his licence and displayed poor balance when walking to the police vehicle.
The officer did not note smell of alcohol.
HELD: In this case, there was no dispute that the officer's belief in reasonable and probable grounds was honestly held and subjectively valid.
While the officer could have asked the accused if he had been drinking alcohol, the weight to be given to any response from the officer was subjective Ã» he was not required to accept what he was told.
Although it is possible to speculate that the symptoms of impairment in this case were caused by some medical condition, there is no evidence of any other possible explanation for the egregious driving and physical condition of the accused.
In the absence of any evidence suggesting an alternative explanation, it is reasonable to conclude that the most obvious case was impairment by alcohol.
The driving pattern and physical symptoms of the accused paint a stereotypical portrait of a motorist impaired by alcohol.
The absence of a smell of alcohol or any admission of consumption does not vitiate the probative value of the other indicia when considered in their totality.
In the face of the manner of driving and very significant symptoms of impairment, it would be ludicrous to suggest that the officer could only have had a reasonable suspicion that the accused had alcohol in his body.
The Court found that the officer had reasonable and probable grounds.
No charter breach was established.
The certificate was not excluded.","[0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 7, 5, 10, 13, 12, 11, 9, 14]"

The Court had earlier acquitted the accused on the charge of driving while disqualified as there was no evidence regarding the status of the accused's driver's licence.
At issue was whether the GiO cycle or moped which the accused was operating was a motor vehicle as defined by the Criminal Code.
The accused asserted that his GiO bike was operated that night by pedaling it as the electric motor was not working and asserted that driver's licence was not required to operate the GiO bike nor was he required to put licence plate on it.
HELD: The accused was found not guilty of the charges before the Court.
There was no evidence that the electric motor on the GiO bike was operational that evening and the officer testified that he observed the accused dragging his feet while driving the moped.","[0, 1, 3, 5, 6, 7, 4, 8, 9, 10, 12, 11, 14, 13]"

Her principal contact in that regard was Barry Travers who is a partner with KPMG and was at that time charged with the responsibility of starting the quality assurance practice.
The relevant circumstances are recited in considerable detail in the trial judge’s decision.
[5] Ms. Bureau sued for damages naming KPMG and Barry Travers defendants.
Her claim alleged both wrongful dismissal and negligent misrepresentation.
[6] The trial judge found no negligent misrepresentation but awarded damages equivalent to five months notice for wrongful dismissal.
Ms. Bureau appeals the dismissal of her claim for negligent misrepresentation and also the notice period for the wrongful dismissal.
The respondent cross-appeals, claiming that the five-month notice period should be reduced due to Ms. Bureau’s failure to mitigate.","The defendant seeks a stay of the action pursuant to s. 8 of The Arbitration Act.

HELD: The action was stayed pending arbitration.
The plaintiff's statement of claim does not rely on the 2000 merger agreement, the claim is based solely on the new partnership agreement and alleges breaches of the partnership agreement.

Vermeulen 2001NSSC49] BETWEEN: ANDREW GERALD VERMEULENPETITIONER- and - JANET FRANCINE MACDONALD (VERMEULEN)RESPONDENTD E C I S I O N HEARD: At Windsor, Nova Scotia on December 6, 2000 and January 17, 2001 before the Honourable Justice Allan P. Boudreau.
DECISION: March 29, 2001COUNSEL: Jean M. Dewolfe, Counsel for the Petitioner.
Caroll Daniels, Counsel for the Respondent.
Boudreau, J.
INTRODUCTION [1] The parties have made counter applications to vary spousal and/or child support and lump sum spousal support less than two years after being divorced and less than one year after the Court of Appeal decision which settled the support awards of the trial judge.
Mr. Vermeulen originally claimed material change in circumstances based on his poor farming results in 1999 and Ms. Macdonald’s improved employment and income situation.
Mr. Vermeulen now relies on a change in Ms. MacDonald’s income position only.
She seeks to increase child support and maintain spousal support at the current level, at least to 2002.
She also seeks a lump sum support payment of $20,000.00 to reimburse her for the RRSP’s she cashed for the down payment on a home and for moving expenses, etc.
I will therefore only recite and review the facts outlined in those decisions together with the alleged material changes in circumstances since that time.
She was basically debt free.","The proposed appellants are some of the defendants in an action commenced by Schneider against them on the grounds that he, as representative plaintiff, and others suffered financial losses due to negligence on the part of McMillan.
The representative plaintiff and other investors purchased 'cells' in gold exploration prospect owned and promoted by Royal Crown Gold Reserve Inc. based on that defendant's representation that the purchase price was deductible from the purchaser's earned income for income tax purposes and the tax opinions provided by McMillan.
McMillan's opinion letters were posted on Royal Crown's website.
The representative plaintiff purchased the cells and then filed tax returns claiming deduction, which was disallowed by the Canada Revenue Agency.
The representative plaintiff commenced this action claiming that he and others suffered financial losses due to McMillan's negligence.
McMillan applied to strike the statement of claim on the grounds that it was devoid of merit pursuant to Queen's Bench Rule 173(c) and opposed the certification of the action on the basis that the relationship between them and the representative plaintiff was insufficient to found a recognized duty of care between a lawyer and a non-client.
Their application was supported by affidavits indicating that their tax opinions were not to be given to prospective investors.
The plaintiff filed an affidavit from another lawyer, who deposed that when he prepared such opinion letters regarding tax consequences he reviewed all the underlying documents and agreements beforehand to protect the reputation of his law firm, knowing that the opinions were often relied upon as marketing tool to potential investors.
The Chambers judge dismissed McMillan's application and it brought this application for leave to appeal under s. 8 of The Court of Appeal Act except as provided by s. 39(3) of The Class Actions Act.
HELD: The Court dismissed the applications.
It held that the Chambers judge was correct in holding that the action was not devoid of merit or vexatious.
The judge had reviewed the affidavits and concluded that a lawyer may owe a duty of care to a non-client in specific circumstances, including those of this case.
McMillan should have been aware of the use made by the mining industry of opinion letters and taken steps to prevent their opinion being used inappropriately for the purpose of inducing potential investors to invest with their client.
The Court also found that the Chambers judge did not err in certifying the claim of negligence as a common issue that predominated over other issues affecting individual members of a class.
McMillan's argument that the factual base pled by the representative plaintiff did not establish a common issue to meet the requirements of s. 6(1)(c) of The Class Actions Act failed because, in this case, the class members suffered real losses allegedly as a result of McMillan's negligence.
These facts coupled with the case law stating that a lawyer may owe a duty of care to a non-client and the plaintiff's affiant's evidence, established a common issue that met the requirements of the Act.","[0, 4, 1, 5, 8, 7, 3, 10, 13, 11, 2, 22, 6]"

026 ] HER MAJESTY THE QUEENagainstFREDERICK WILLIAM LOGAN BLACK D E C I S I O NHEARD: Before the Honourable Justice John D. Murphy, Supreme Court of Nova Scotia, at Halifax, Nova Scotia, on December 17, 2001.
DECISION: December 17, 2001, Orally.
WRITTEN RELEASE OF ORAL: January 29, 2002COUNSEL: Gary Holt, Q.C., for the CrownFrederick Black, personally, DefenceD. Bruce Clarke, for George Redling MURPHY, J.
[1] Frederick Black has been charged with three counts of fraud, contrary to s. 380(1)(a) of the Criminal Code, relating to his activities as president and principal shareholder of NsC Diesel Power Inc. (“NsC”), a bankrupt corporation.
Mr Black has brought motions (the “Charter Motions”) seeking a stay of those charges on the basis that his rights under the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms were violated by the Office of the Superintendent of Bankruptcy (“OSB”) and by the R.C.M.P.
during investigations of his activities and of the administration of the NsC bankruptcy.
The present Application is made by Mr. Black seeking an Order compelling George Redling, who was Superintendent of Bankruptcy while those investigations were being conducted, to testify at the hearing of the Charter Motions.","The parties had three children during their marriage.
After the marriage ended in 1988, the husband respondent, medical specialist, moved from Moose Jaw to Ontario where his annual income was about $175,000.
The children stayed with the petitioner wife in Moose Jaw. She was not able to work as registered nurse until she upgraded her education, which she slowly did as she could afford it.
She and the children lived on very little income and relied upon social assistance because the respondent often did not pay child support.
The parties were regularly in court.
In 1994, the respondent left his position in Ontario and moved to Milwaukee, believing his prospects were better in the U.S. However, he lost his position in Milwaukee and opened his own clinic.
His income dropped to as little as $15,000 in 2001.
In this application, the respondent applied to vary two support orders, one made in 1998 and the other issued in 2001.
He sought to expunge the arrears in respect of each and a declaration that the three children are no longer children of the marriage.
His reason for seeking to have the arrears expunged was because he, now 72, wanted to retire in the next couple of years.
The petitioner, 63, deeply in debt and on long-term disability, was still caring for one of their children because he suffers from schizophrenia.
HELD: The Court held that two of the children had ceased to be children of the marriage as of 2002 and 2008 respectively.
With respect to the third child, the Court found that as a result of the serious and long-term mental health problems suffered by him, he remained a child of the marriage.
The Court then found that the respondent's arrears in respect of the 1998 child support order were $7,000.
Based upon the respondent's imputed income of $109,000 per year established by the Court in its 2001 order, and the dates upon which the two children ceased to be so under the Divorce Act, the Court calculated the amount of child support owed by the respondent at $186,300.
The Court rejected the respondent's argument that he could not afford to pay the arrears because his expenses left him with an income surplus of only $13,000.
The Court discounted most of the claimed expenses and found that the respondent had $58,000 at his disposal and therefore had the ability to pay his arrears.
The Court found that the respondent had chosen to minimize his earning capacity by staying in the U.S. in private practice and thus the respondent could not assert that the Court should use his actual income rather than his imputed income to vary the amount of child support he was ordered to pay in 2001.
The undue hardship that the petitioner had suffered for 25 years constituted the most compelling reason for the Court to refuse to reduce or expunge the respondent's arrears.
The application was dismissed and the respondent ordered to pay arrears and to pay child support in the amount of $927.","[0, 3, 1, 4, 2, 5, 6, 7, 10, 9, 8]"

The invitation for tenders suggested bidders inform themselves about Devco’s operations at the VJCPP, including at the newly constructed lifting and banking centre (herein “LBC”).
Among the other contractors submitting bids was Doug Burns Contracting Limited, (herein “Burns”), whose existing contract to provide these services to Devco was about to expire.
A.
BACKGROUND[3] Devco processed coal received from various sources and of different grades or qualities.
[8] The advent of the LBC also coincided with Devco restructuring the personnel involved in overseeing the banking, blending and lifting of coal at the VJCPP.
THE TENDER and THE CONTRACT[9] The invitation for tenders described the nature of the work to be carried out, certain terms and conditions that would apply to the performance of the work and the procedure for bidding for the contract.
The Purchase Order also incorporated by reference the general conditions and specifications set out in the tender.
The following clauses from the specifications and general conditions are relevant to this action.
Clause 1 “Contract Term” - Contract was to run from June 17, 1985 [sic] to March 31, 1988 “subject to cancellation - Clause 14"".
Clause 5 “Contractor’s Equipment” - The contractor was required “to supply and maintain” sufficient equipment.
This clause expressly stated that “delays in operations due to breakdown of equipment will not be tolerated.","HELD: The Court sentenced the accused pursuant to s. 742.1 of the Criminal Code in force at the time of the offence that precluded the use of conditional sentence order for a serious personal injury offence, which included sexual assault.
The Court found that the offences fell on the low end of the sexual assault spectrum as there was no skin to skin contact, the contact was brief and without violence or threats.
The aggravating factors were that the accused had two previous convictions for sexual offences and that one of the victims had some cognitive disability.
The accused was sentenced to a term of one year imprisonment for each count, followed by a term of probation of two years.
The sentences were to be served concurrently.","[0, 16, 50, 56, 1, 58, 15, 49, 51, 10, 33, 28, 8]"

Acting on this tip, Constable Gary R. Huett applied to Justice of the Peace Elizabeth Mullaly (""the JP"") and received a warrant to search the home.
In executing the warrant, the RCMP found evidence confirming the grow operation.
The judge agreed and quashed the warrant.
This rendered the search unlawful and thereby a presumptive breach of Ms. Durling's Charter rights.
Consequently the judge excluded the evidence obtained in the search.
This led to Ms. Durling's acquittal.
[3] The Crown has appealed to this court.
It submits that the JP had ample evidence to justify the warrant and that the judge misapplied established legal principles in ordering it quashed.
Alternatively, the Crown maintains that even had the warrant been properly quashed, the police conduct did not justify excluding the evidence obtained in the search.
Applying the proper standard of review of the decision to issue the warrant, I conclude that the warrant was validly issued and that the judge erred in law by holding otherwise.
Consequently, the evidence obtained as a result of the search was wrongly excluded and had it been admitted, the result would not necessarily have been the same.","HELD: The Court granted the application.
It held that: 1) a solicitor-client relationship was created between the applicants and the defendants based on the evidence; and 2) that the applicants had not rebutted the presumption that they had received confidential information during the meeting that was relevant to the plaintiff’s action against the defendants.
That finding was sufficient to disqualify them for acting for the plaintiff.","[1, 3, 4, 12, 10, 7, 11, 14, 6, 13, 19, 18, 15, 16]"

All three of these cases were heard in March of 1989 and a decision could come at any time.
I had deliberately held off deciding this matter awaiting that decision which might be conclusive as to the questions in issue.
However, in view of the fact that no decision has been filed by the Supreme Court of Canada and there is no indication that a decision is imminent, I think it appropriate to wait no longer.
The facts as to each applicants claim is set forth in each of their affidavits on file herein.
Article 28.02 states:""The Board may employ a member beyond the‑retirement date on terms and conditions to be agreed between the Board and the member.""
This is disputed by the respondent.","The Crown found the accused not guilty.
With respect to the issue of identification, it held that the officer was empowered by s. 209.1(2)(a) of The Traffic Safety Act to require an operator of a motor vehicle to provide his name and address.
The accused had admitted that the statement given was voluntary.
Although there had been no identification in Court, the officer had seen the accused operating a motor vehicle and had properly obtained his name and date of birth.
That person was arrested and released on an appearance notice.
Counsel for the accused appeared on the scheduled date and entered a guilty plea and then appeared on the trial date and the accused was noted as present.
All of these facts constituted prima facie proof of identity.
Regarding the other issues, the Court held that notice under s. 260(6) of the Code can be given to counsel of record without proof that counsel consented to the receipt of such notice.
However, the Crown had not established that proper notice was given either to the accused or his counsel as required by s. 260(5), either by way of viva voce or affidavit evidence from the person effecting service or an admission of counsel.
Without such compliance with s. 260(6), the certificate was not admissible in evidence.
There was no other evidence of disqualification and no evidence as to the nature of the disqualification on which the Court could conclude that a s. 259 offence had been committed.","[12, 7, 0, 1, 3, 11, 15, 4, 14, 13, 10, 23, 9, 21]"

:Leave is sought by the appellant and if granted to appeal from a sentence of two years imprisonment for perjury imposed by His Honour Judge Archibald of the Provincial Court on October 8, 1992.
The appellant was charged that he committed perjury at the preliminary hearing of Michael Merlin Fillmore by giving false testimony with intent to mislead the court contrary to section 131(1) of the Criminal Code.
He pled guilty to the charge.
Mr. Fillmore was a co‑accused in a break, enter and theft in which the appellant was also involved.
The break occurred at a garage at which the appellant had been employed.","Civil Procedure Injunction
HELD: The first portion of the statement of claim is an attempt by the plaintiff to have the Court take jurisdiction over a matter that is already before the Saskatchewan Human Rights Tribunal.
While the court has jurisdiction to hear human rights complaints, the jurisdiction only arises after the tribunal process has been exhausted.
Since the tribunal procedure has not been completed, the portions of the statement of claim dealing with the human rights complaint are stayed on the basis that the underlying issues may only be heard by the court upon application of the Chief Commissioner of the Saskatchewan Human Rights Code pursuant to s. 29.6 of the Code.
With respect to the claim that the defendant breached The Animal Protection Act, the essence of the claim is to seek damages against the plaintiff for the loss of the service dog.
That portion of the claim must be struck because the plaintiffs cannot circumvent the provisions of The Animal Protection Act, 1999 nor eliminate the defendant’s right to be charged and tried in Provincial Court through the expediency of claiming a declaration in a civil suit.
The third claim is that the defendant was negligent in allowing other children to interact with the service dog will not be struck because, assuming the facts in the pleadings are true, the claim for damages is viable.
Likewise, the fourth claim that the defendant intentionally inflicted mental and emotional suffering on the autistic plaintiff will not be struck as is not plain and obvious from the pleadings that the claim cannot succeed.
The plaintiffs’ application for an interlocutory injunction was dismissed because the claims that have not been struck are not rationally connected to the injunction, even assuming the remaining claims present a serious issue to be tried they do not justify a finding that the plaintiffs will suffer irreparable harm if the injunction is refused and the balance of convenience weighs in favour of not granting an injunction.","[0, 2, 1, 3, 5, 7, 6, 4, 8, 10, 9, 11, 12]"

Final Post trial briefs received November 15, 1990.
Mr. Brookes was retained to incorporate a company, ""Z & P Developments Limited"" (Z & P) and to act as general legal counsel to Z & P and to the project.
One of Mr. Brookes' duties as legal counsel to the project was to obtain and disburse funds from mortgage draws or advances from various sources.
While performing those duties during late 1936 and early 1987, Mr. Brookes received a number of irrevocable letters of direction, which he acknowledged, requiring him to pay the proceeds from mortgage draws or advances in a particular manner.
The plaintiffs have also claimed Mr. Brookes was negligent in his written acknowledgement of this latter irrevocable letter of direction and that he broke the undertaking contained in that acknowledgement.
The plaintiffs have alleged negligent misrepresentation and in the alternative, breach of undertaking or breach of trust on the part of Mr. Brookes.
IssuesThe plaintiffs have raised a number of issues in their claims against Mr. Brookes and these can be summarized as follows:a.
Did Mr. Brookes negligently misrepresent his intentions to the plaintiffs in his March 11, 1987 written acknowledgement of the irrevocable direction dated March 9, 1987;b.","The determination of whether the trial judge’s conclusion regarding the officer’s suspicion was reasonable was question of law subject to the correctness standard.
The respondent conceded that the officer had the requisite subjective belief that he had alcohol in his body so the appeal centered on whether the objective test had been met.
The appeal court did not find any basis to disturb the trial judge’s finding of fact as to the factors the officer based his suspicion of alcohol consumption on.
The court noted the trouble with the fact that the respondent admitted to drinking alcohol that “evening” but the stop was at 5:00 am in the morning.
The trial judge disregarded the respondent’s admission to drinking because there was no smell of alcohol and the trial judge said there should be if the consumption was recent.
The court concluded that the trial judge erred in dismissing the alcohol consumption admission.
A reasonable person would have assumed that the officer’s question was with respect to recent consumption of alcohol not an earlier irrelevant time.
It was also found reasonable for the officer to believe the consumption was recent.
The court concluded that a reasonable person standing in the officer’s place would reasonably suspect that the respondent had alcohol in his body.
An answer by an accused person that they have been drinking was found to be stronger support for a suspicion than the smell of alcohol.
Because the respondent’s Charter rights were not breached a new trial was ordered.","[4, 14, 15, 10, 9, 19, 11, 1, 18]"

It made the following recommendations regarding the draft order: 1) the sale should be held under the direction of a solicitor other than the plaintiff’s solicitor; 2) that relying upon a partial appraisal and in the absence of information on the condition of the property, setting the reserve bid at $100,000 might not reflect the best price.
Fairness demanded the reserve bid be set at $125,000 but the court set the bid at $115,000.
If the property could not be sold at that price, the plaintiff was given leave to apply to the court for a lower reserve bid; and 3) Queen’s Bench rule 10-47(2) required that purchase monies are to be paid into court to the credit of the cause to be applied as directed by the court, including costs.
Only after an application and service upon the defendant and after the court had assessed solicitor client costs could monies be disbursed to the plaintiff.

The applicant here is requesting an order of prohibition and certiorari directing that Judge Archibald and any other provincial court judge cannot hear the trial The Queen v. Joseph Glenn Jessome.

For the record, I refer to paragraphs 4 to 10 of that affidavit:4.

It held that it could determine the defendants’ application prior to the plaintiffs’ application for certification.
The court found that the facts were not in dispute and there was no evidence that the plaintiffs or any members of the proposed class had suffered any damages.
The plaintiffs’ argument that it was misleading to label identical products differently was not supported by their pleadings or any affidavit evidence.
There was no genuine issue requiring a trial.
The court reviewed the various alleged breaches of statute and dismissed them.
It was not necessary to decide the application for certification.","[2, 0, 8, 4, 6, 7, 5, 1, 9, 3]"

At the conclusion of the hearing the application to dismiss the claim was reserved, while the application for an interlocutory injunction was dismissed with written reasons to follow.

The court held that the request for an assessment was not fair to the defendant and would not be in the interests of justice.
The court reviewed the factors set out in Machula v. Kuse and found that the applicant had failed to provide the specific information required to direct an assessment of six years of legal services covering a multitude of issues on a substantial number of files.
The court distinguished the applicant from the case of Vo v. Phillips Legal Profession Corp. because the defendant was not an unsophisticated client.
The length of time was unusual, which would further support the need for clearly outlined reasons to justify going back six years.
Further, the applicant had not made any complaints to the defendant even during the post-election period and had assured him that he would be paid.
The defendant would be severely prejudiced by the assessment requested because of the time that it would take him from his practice to review six years of billings on hundreds of attendances.
The applicant had not provided any properly supported allegations of misrepresentation, fraud or dereliction of duty by the defendant, whereas there was plenty of evidence that his legal services were effective and appreciated.","[13, 19, 10, 12, 3, 11, 0, 17, 27, 4, 15, 18]"

If the court is to make a costs award, what is the appropriate order?","HELD: The majority of the court granted leave to appeal and restored the conviction entered by the trial judge.
The parties and court agreed that the provisions of s. 34(1) as they read prior to May 2012 were applicable.
The issues were determined as follows: 1) the appeal court judge erred by misunderstanding the applicable test and inappropriately focusing on the respondent’s belief.
The appeal court judge reviewed cases that led him to focus on the doctrine of mistake of fact, which was not argued by the respondent at trial and were not part of his grounds of appeal; 2) the trial judge accepted some but not all of the expert’s evidence, as he was entitled to do.
The trial judge also reinterpreted the video evidence, which was found to be an error by the Court of Appeal.
The trial judge considered the factors without weighing the use of force to a nicety.
He was determining the objective reasonableness of the force based on the factors; and 3) the appeal court judge properly instructed himself on the standard of review but failed to analyze the decision of the trial judge based on that standard, namely, whether the evidence was reasonably capable of supporting the trial judge’s conclusion based on the evidence as a whole.
The dissenting judge would have granted leave to appeal but then would have dismissed the appeal.
The dissenting judge of the Court of Appeal found that the appeal court judge erred in his approach but reached the right conclusion that the trial judge erred.
The trial judge ignored the fact that the encounter was only three seconds long and he mischaracterized the thrust-kick as extreme force.
The respondent had to react quickly.
The trial judge also erred in questioning whether the respondent honestly believed he was in danger of harm.","[3, 1, 2, 8, 6, 5, 11, 13, 10, 7, 15, 12, 14, 0]"

The court found that the accused’s s. 8 Charter rights were breached.
Pursuant to a Grant analysis, the court excluded the evidence obtained after the illegal entry of the accused’s home.
The court found that the accused had not consented to the entry by the officer and the complainant and it was therefore a warrantless search.
The officer did not have the lawful authority to enter the home on the basis of arresting the father as he was not in hot pursuit.
The complainant had not obtained a warrant under s. 13.1 of The Child and Family Services Act to enter the accused’s home and therefore had no lawful authority to enter the home.
There were no exigent circumstances to justify the search such as preventing the destruction of evidence as they already established that the person they sought was not in the house.
The unlawful entry and search of the accused’s home was a severe breach of the accused’s Charter rights.
The impact upon her was severe as the complainant gathered evidence and apprehended her children.
The accused’s assault on the complainant was minor in nature and although not excusable, her offence was a reaction to a significant breach of her rights.
The administration of justice was served by excluding the evidence.","[1, 2, 3, 5, 4, 7, 6, 9, 8, 10, 12, 14, 11]"

The Crown disclosed the video-taped interaction between the officer and the accused to the defence at the outset and it was clearly pertinent to the issue of reasonable suspicion, but the defence failed to raise it;
and 2) there were two periods of delay and the court was satisfied that the 77 minutes between arrival at the station and the taking of the second sample was satisfactorily explained.
However, the court found that first period of 35 minutes between the arrest to the time of departure was not satisfactorily explained.
The officer did not act expeditiously and the delay may have prejudiced the accused because when, as here, the readings are slightly above the legal limit, the tests need to be taken as soon as practicable to ensure that the accused’s blood alcohol content at the time of driving is determined accurately.
The Crown was not entitled to rely on the presumption in s. 259(1)(c) of the Code.","[8, 3, 7, 13, 4, 10, 5, 9, 1, 15, 18, 17, 16]"

I.
Introduction [1] This appeal concerns the application of s. 2 of The Limitation of Civil Rights Act, RSS 1978, c L-16 [LCRA], in relation to a motion for a deficiency judgment by the respondent bank.
[2] The main issue relates to how the proceeds of a sale of property by judicial listing should be applied against a mortgage balance when there are both purchase money and non-purchase money balances.
It also requires a review of these decisions to ascertain whether or not the conclusion reached in Andrew (CA) is contrary to that reached in Hrynewich Holdings.
background [3] The appellants granted a residential mortgage in favour of the respondent on January 10, 2011, securing a loan in the amount of $460,800.00.
This loan was a consolidation of existing debt.
The appellants fell into default and the respondent commenced foreclosure proceedings.","The accused was found guilty of three counts of dangerous driving causing death, contrary to s. 249(4) of the Criminal Code, and one count of dangerous driving causing bodily harm, contrary to s. 249(3) of the Code.
During his employment as professional truck driver, the accused had driven into construction zone on highway and hit another vehicle that had been stopped.
The three teenage occupants of the vehicle were killed and flag person was severely injured as result of the collision.
The accused was sure that he had not been asleep at the time of the accident but felt that he had not been paying attention.
He had not noticed any of the signs posted at 100-metre intervals after the start of the construction zone 1.6 km south of the accident.
The accused was 41 years of age.
He had obtained his A-1 driver’s licence in 2009 and had clean driving abstract.
He was married and had three children.
He had recently been diagnosed with mild sleep apnea.
He expressed remorse to the victim’s families and suffered from post-traumatic stress disorder.|
HELD: The accused was sentenced to three years in imprisonment on the first count and three years concurrent for the second and third counts, and one year concurrent to the other counts on the fourth count.
He was prohibited from operating a motor vehicle for five years and from possessing a firearm for 10 years after his release from imprisonment.
The aggravating factors in the case were that the accused’s inattentiveness caused the death of three people and severely injured another person.
The impact of the children’s deaths was devastating on their families.
The accused was a professional driver and capable of exercising more skill and vigilance, especially when he was operating a semi-trailer truck in a construction zone.
The mitigating factors were that the accused pled guilty and expressed profound remorse.
He had not been drinking and had a clear driving record.
The accused was at low risk to re-offend.","[5, 7, 9, 4, 1, 3, 13, 2, 10]"
1047,"The respondent, Shawn Diederichs, is the biological father of the two children.
She was the biological mother of the two children.
[2] The grandmother argues she is a person of sufficient interest with respect to the two boys.
Her position is that she and the father should have joint custody of the boys but her home be the children’s primary residence.
She is willing to provide the father with parenting time with the children.
[3] The father takes the position that it would be in the best interests of the children to move from the primary care of the grandmother to his primary care.
He is not opposed to the grandmother having reasonable and liberal access with the children.
Is the maternal grandmother a person of sufficient interest with respect to the children; 2.
If the grandmother is a person of sufficient interest, what parenting arrangement would be in the best interests of the children; and 3.
History of Proceedings [6] The mother and father lived together as common-law spouses from January 2005 until January 2008.
The father then filed his Answer and Counter-Petition.
Pursuant to the terms of the interim order, the father was declared to be the father of the two children.","HELD: 1) The court ordered joint custody and continued primary residence with the wife and specified access to the husband.
The child’s interests were best served by a parenting regime that preserved the stability the wife provided as his primary caregiver, while expanding the periods of uninterrupted time with his father.
It was best that the parties interact minimally with each other.
The mother was generally contemptuous of the husband’s role as parent and sometimes restricted or denied the child’s access with him.
There was no credible evidence that the child was suicidal as the mother alleged, nor did any evidence support her allegations of physical or sexual abuse.
Rather, evidence confirmed that the child was smart, sometimes sensitive, but generally happy.
2) The husband had professional corporation.
His income was determined from his line 150 income, as adjusted to reflect the actual dividend income he received.
His income should not be augmented by dividend income equal to his corporation’s net earnings.
Only current pre-tax earnings are truly surplus to corporation’s needs, without exposing it to encroachment on its capital or undermining its viability.
The relevance of the wife’s income was limited to the apportionment of s. expenses.
It was not appropriate to impute income to her.
She was intentionally underemployed, but her decision was justified initially by the needs of her son and more recently by her own reasonable educational needs and the obligation to become qualified to practice medicine in Canada.
Retroactive child support was not appropriate, except in respect of the two-month period when the wife was overseas, the husband was caring for their child and he admittedly neglected to pay child support in accordance with court order.
There was considerable evidence upon which to conclude that a retroactive award would place an undue hardship upon the husband as, pursuant to the terms of this judgment, he was obliged to assume significant family debt, provide a considerable equalization payment and pay increased child and spousal support.
3) The husband retained the family home and sole responsibility for the mortgage thereon.
The court ordered him to pay one half of the equity in the home to the wife.
Otherwise, the parties were to retain all other items of family property in their respective possession and be solely responsible for any indebtedness in their respective names.
The Family Property Act does not mandate the apportionment of debt, equal or otherwise, save to the extent that fairness requires an unequal division of family property to reflect the parties’ respective obligations.
The court’s discretion to equalize the parties’ debt by an uneven division did not extend to the family home.
4) The wife was entitled to compensatory and non-compensatory spousal support.
The disparity in their incomes was directly attributable to her role in the marriage and their mutual efforts to advance his career.
The wife’s income consisted almost entirely of spousal support.
However, the high amount of debt assumed by the husband coupled with his limited means for satisfying this judgment, warranted a departure from the range of outcomes suggested by the Spousal Support Advisory Guidelines.
Given the genuine and material uncertainty as to the wife’s future need and extent to which she will achieve self-sufficiency, an indefinite award reviewable on the earlier of a date approximately one year from the trial date or the wife becoming qualified to practice medicine was appropriate.
The court declined to impute income to the wife or to order retroactive spousal support.
5) Judgment for divorce was granted, with judgment to take effect on the conclusion of the appeal period.","[4, 1, 3, 5, 8, 13, 7, 16, 14, 10, 27, 21]"
1048,"Background [1] Although Gordon Joseph Fiddler was originally charged with second degree murder with regard to the death of his cousin Tommy Fiddler, on November 3, 2017, the Court found him not guilty of second degree murder but guilty of manslaughter.
[2] Earlier at the commencement of the trial on July 13, 2017, Gordon Joseph Fiddler pled guilty to possession of a firearm while prohibited from doing so.
That firearm was the weapon used by Gordon when he fatally shot Tommy once in the head on February 25, 2016, at the Waterhen Lake First Nation.
[4] Since the Court’s November 3, 2017, decision both Crown and defence counsel have changed.
The Court received the very thorough Gladue Report completed by Christine Goodwin on June 1, 2018, and counsel provided the Court with their sentencing submissions on June 8, 2018 referring to multiple, meaningful case law for the consideration of the Court.
During the sentencing submissions the Crown presented six victim impact statements of the siblings of the victim Tommy Fiddler; two of his sisters and four of his brothers; collectively marked as Exhibit P12.
This matter was adjourned until today’s date for formal sentencing.
The Crown suggested that in the specific circumstances of this case a one year concurrent sentence should be imposed for the possession of a firearm while prohibited from doing so.","HELD: The application was allowed in part and the balance of images found on the computer were excluded from the evidence at trial pursuant to s. 24(2) of the Charter.
The court found that the evidence found through temporary Internet sites was admissible.
The reason for obtaining the warrant was apparently abandoned by the police at the beginning of the search of the computer.
The police had no authority to search the computer generally.
They were only authorized to look at the Internet history.
The search of the non-Internet history was a serious infringement of the accused’s s. 8 Charter right.
The temporary files created as a result of the visits on the Internet was evidence of Internet history, and because of this connection, this evidence was not excluded.","[3, 6, 10, 9, 13, 8, 1, 4]"
