The Court found the Crown could not rely on s. 258(1)(g) of the Code and there was no evidence of the accused's blood level. 1) The Court found that in order for a certificate of analysis under s. 258(1)(g) of the Code to constitute evidence as set out in that subsection, the make and model of the approved instrument has to be set out in the certificate or be proven by other evidence.  2) It was not possible to know who made the alteration. The use of a certificate is a shortcut afforded to the Crown. If it is to be employed, it must be employed correctly. In the circumstances, the approved instrument was not adequately identified as to make and model.","The accused is charged with driving an automobile with a blood alcohol level exceeding eighty milligrams of alcohol in 100 millilitres of blood. The police observed the accused blowing into something that she described as an 'intoxilyzer' at 2:40 and 3:01. The Crown filed a certificate of analysis pursuant to s258(1)(g) for the intended purpose of proving the accused's blood alcohol levels. The document consists of preprinted form and is made up of pre-printed words and underlined blanks. There are five alterations of the preprinted material and one alteration of writing contained within one of the blanks on the document. Each of these changes consists of changing the expression of the year from 19 to 2003. Under the somewhat unusual circumstances of this case, Parliament has the power to deem things to have been proven regardless of whether the question is one of fact or of law. HELD: The accused's charge is dismissed. 1)It is not possible to know who made the striking out of the word and symbol 'Breathalyzer®' and the writing in of the 'Intoxilizer' and there is no symbol with it. While it is probably the same person made the alteration that is not initialled, one cannot adequately be sure that this was done. 2)The accused's argument that she did not adequately designate the model of the approved instrument was not supported by the evidence. 3)There was no evidence that the accused blew into any of the instruments designated for the purposes of identification, nor that there was any evidence that she was qualified to make this argument. There was no medical evidence as to the alcohol level at the time of the samples taken, no reference at all to the name of the instrument, and the proof would be made by stating simply that the said sample was received directly into an instrument approved for this purpose, section 237(6) of the Criminal Code. 4)The certificate may be used to prove facts, not law. The Court noted that R. v. Gilbert (1976), 31 C.C.C.(2d) 251 (Ont. C.A.) was specifically not followed in Saskatchewan. It was unnecessary and inappropriate for the Court to comment upon those issues.","[1] The accused is charged with driving an automobile with a blood alcohol level exceeding eighty milligrams of alcohol in one hundred millilitres of blood. [3] The Crown filed a certificate of analysis pursuant to section 258(1)(g) for the intended purpose of proving the accused’s blood alcohol level. 1. Is it a requirement of subparagraph 258(1)(g)(i) that the approved instrument be identified by way of make and model? Accordingly I must and do take the law to be that in order for a certificate of analysis under paragraph 258(1)(g) to constitute evidence as set out in that subsection, the make and model of the approved instrument has to be set out in the certificate or be proven by other evidence. Under the somewhat unusual circumstances of this case, I find that the approved instrument is not adequately identified as to make and model by means of the certificate. [11] It follows that the Crown cannot rely upon paragraph 258(1)(g) and accordingly there is no evidence of the accused’s blood alcohol level.

It indicates that the samples were taken at 2:40 and 3:01, with results of 120 and 110 milligram, respectively. HELD: The Certificate of Analysis was dismissed. 1)It is rarely, if ever, adequate to meet the burden borne by the Crown in a criminal trial. The use of certificate is shortcut afforded to the Crown.

While it is probably the same person made the same alteration that is not initialled, one cannot adequately be sure of this. 2)The certificate is only a shortcut afforded the Crown by virtue of the fact that it is only afforded to it. If the Crown had intended the contrary to be the case, it would have specifically stated that the approved instrument needed to be identified, just as it did with respect to the alcohol standard. There was no evidence that the qualified technician states in the certificate that an approved instrument was employed.

The petitioner seeks joint custody with specified access. The petitioner acknowledges an obligation to pay child support but there is an issue with respect to his income and whether the interim order should be retroactive. The children are ages 3 and 2.HELD: 1) Section 3 of The Children's Law Act 1997 provides for a presumption of joint custody where parents of a child have cohabitated after the birth of the child. That is the situation here. There is nothing in the evidence to rebut that presumption on an interim basis. In making interim orders, the Court tries to disrupt the lives of the children as little as possible. The status quo in this case is represented by the verbal agreement between the parties entered into after their separation. That is the petitioner would have the children every third week during his week off from Saturday to Tuesday. This seems reasonable on an interim basis. This agreement did not address the fact that the petitioner shall be laid off for two months in the spring. It is reasonable that during this period his contact with the children should be increased. The petitioner has not seen the children for 10 months. He will have to be re-introduced to them. A phase in period is required. 2) The petitioner has worked for the same drilling company for about 6 years. His gross income in 2006 was $112,064. This is verified by his year to date income statement from his employer. The petitioner attests that $9,600 of his income is a 'living allowance' paid to cover expenses for his truck, fuel, vehicle maintenance and meals and should be deducted from his Line 150 income to arrive at his current income for child support purposes. This is a matter for the trial judge who will have the benefit of the 2006 tax return and notice of assessment and better evidence of the expenses and their purpose and make any retroactive adjustment deemed necessary. The petitioner's income for child support purposes is $112,064. 3) The claim for retroactive child support is a claim for child support payments which pre-date service of the notice of this application. The petitioner was served with the application in September 2006. The petitioner lived up to the parties' verbal agreement to pay child support of $1,200 per month starting October 2005. He unilaterally stopped paying child support in January 2006. He attests that his reason for doing so was because he was not having access to the children. The obligation to pay child support is not contingent on a payor's ability to see their children.  The respondent's income is substantially less then that of the petitioner's. The child support was necessary to meet the children's basis ongoing needs.

The landlord's reasons were neither unreasonable nor arbitrary, given the reality of the market and his past experiences with a winter vacancy. There may be other situations where consent could reasonably be withheld. The tenancy is declared to have been renewed for another year (with the understanding the landlord will allow the tenant to terminate at any point after May 31). Both parties acted in good faith and, while it might seem unfair to lock the tenant into a lease he believed had converted to month-to-month, the court must make the order the officer should have made in the first place.","This was an appeal by the landlord from an order of the Director which effectively permitted the tenant to convert what had been a year to year lease into a month to month tenancy, but also denied the landlord's request that the tenancy be deemed to have terminated because the tenant effectively refused to renew for another year. The Landlord appealed. Appeal allowed; the tenancy has not been converted into a Month to Month tenancy because the landlord refused his consent in a timely manner. The reasons for withholding consent by landlord are neither arbitrary or unreasonable; in so failing to consider the Landlord's reasons, the Court believes the Residential Tenancies Officer erred in law.","[2] This is an appeal by the Landlord from an order of the Director dated August 31, 2009. That order effectively permitted the Tenant to convert what had been a year to year lease into a month to month one. About four months before the expiry of the second year, the Tenant gave a proper notice that he wished to convert the tenancy into a month to month tenancy, pursuant to the provisions of s.10A of the Residential Tenancies Act, which provides: [5] The Landlord responded within thirty days and refused to consent, giving his reasons why he believed that it was not in his interest to have a month to month tenancy. [7] The Residential Tenancies Officer stated in his reasons that based upon his reading of the Residential Tenancies Act, the Landlord “may not deny the tenant’s request that the lease be changed from a year to year lease to a month to month effective September 1, 2009.” In so failing to consider the Landlord’s reasons, I believe that the Residential Tenancy Officer erred in law. It places the Landlord in the centre of a consenting process and allows the Landlord to exercise some judgment, with the constraint that it not be arbitrary or unreasonable. [13] The reasons of the Landlord here are that, in his experience, this particular flat is much more difficult to lease out at any time of the year other than September 1, which has become almost a standard moving day in south end Halifax, in part because that is the start day for most student apartments. [17] In the result, I allow the appeal and declare that the tenancy has not been converted into a month to month tenancy, because the Landlord refused his consent in a timely manner, for reasons that were neither arbitrary or unreasonable. [22] The Landlord wants the lease to terminate on August 31, 2010, but to alleviate hardship he has unconditionally undertaken to accept an early termination on any date from May 31, 2010 (his undertaking refers to 2009, but I believe that is a typo) until August 31, 2010.",0.32627118644067793,"This was an appeal by the landlord from an order of the Director which effectively permitted the tenant to convert what had been a year to year lease into a month to month tenancy, but also denied the landlord's request that the tenancy be deemed to have terminated because the tenant effectively refused to renew for another year.

There is even evidence from the custody and access report from 2005 that the children, or at least the older child, Jill, expressed similar sentiments about living with her mother. It cannot even be strenuously argued that the wishes of the child, Jill, have in fact changed. Those considerations were before the Court in the form of the custody and access report when the decision was made in 2005. 2) The Court should be loathe to make a variation order solely on the expressed wishes of a child of 11 or 12 years of age without some evidence as to why that current expression of interest has been stated. It may well be that the child truly does wish a change. It may also be that the child, as was referred to in the custody and access report, may be simply reflecting the views and therefore the pressures placed on the child by the non-custodial parent. 3) No evidence has been put forward about the negative impact of the continuation of the current order.

(4th) 291 (Sask. C.A.) cited with approval in Gordon v. Goertz), the court found that as no material change had been demonstrated, this application must be dismissed.

It found that the time between service of the statement of claim and the default judgment was not sufficiently long to prevent the defendant from defending the action. As well, the defendant had provided an arguable defence to the claim in that it pled in its proposed defence of non-compliance with s. 2(3)(b) of the Indian Act.

As well, as pointed out in both Moge and Mosher, the court should recognize the numerous financial consequences to a custodial parent not reflected in the direct cost of supporting a child. Under all of the circumstances, I will award the wife for the support of herself and the child, Kelly, the sum of $1,500.00 monthly. 2) that the Agreement and Minutes of Settlement entered into by the parties and dated June 10, 1994, be incorporated into and form part of the Divorce Judgment insofar as the jurisdiction of the court permits; 3) that the respondent pay to the petitioner the sum of $1,500.00 monthly beginning December 1, 1994, for the support and maintenance of the petitioner and child of the marriage;",0.30340557275541796,"The petitioner sought a divorce from the respondent as well as maintenance for herself and the 5 year old daughter of the marriage.

5_2006skpc2.txt,"The accused is charged with care or control of a motor vehicle while impaired contrary to s. 255(1) and s. 253(a) of the Criminal Code and care or control while over .08 contrary to s. 253(b) of the Code. HELD: There is no remedy of exclusion of the Certificate of Analysis. Accordingly, the accused is guilty of care or control while over .08. The evidence does not prove impairment beyond a reasonable doubt.  1) It is clear from the evidence that the accused's vehicle was inoperable and immovable due to the damage from the accident and its location in the ditch. The defence raised the issue of whether a person can be 'in care or control of a motor vehicle' when there is no risk that the vehicle in question can be put in motion so that it can become dangerous to the public. The Court reviewed the cases. The first person to come upon the accident scene found the accused alone in the vehicle seated in the driver's seat. He saw no visible signs of anyone else at the scene. Upon approaching the vehicle, he observed the accused turn the ignition key to try and start the vehicle. There was no other evidence which established that the 'accused did not occupy that seat for the purpose of setting the vehicle in motion'. The accused has failed to rebut the presumption of care or control under s. 258(1)(a) of the Code and the Court finds that the accused was in 'care or control' of the motor vehicle. 2) Considering the case law and after objectively considering all the indicial of impairment known to the officer, together with the circumstances of the accident itself (which indicate driving error) there can be no doubt the officer had more than reasonable and probable grounds to form the requisite opinion pursuant to s. 254(2) of the Code to make a demand for samples of analysis.  3) The officer was sensitive to the immediate concern of the physical well-being of the accused. Though he may have formed his opinion in the ambulance, he wisely waited until medical personnel had made an initial assessment at the hospital before making any kind of demand. In the circumstances, the Court finds the officer made the demand at the first practical opportunity in relation to the entire investigation. 3) The officer, in coming to his conclusion to make a blood sample demand, considered a number of relevant factors, including time limits to obtain a breath sample, the severity and magnitude of the accident, the potential seriousness of the accused's head and neck injuries, the need for immediate emergency assessment and length of time it would take to treat the accused and keep him under observation. He believed the accused's condition was potentially serious and was completely justified in holding that belief. The evidence has proven the accused required immediate and emergent medical attention which made it obviously impractical to put the accused before a breathalyzer instrument within the time limit fixed by the Code. The officer had reasonable and probable grounds to believe that by reason of his physical condition, the accused may be incapable of providing a sample of his breath, or it would be impracticable to obtain a sample of his breath. All the requirements of s. 254(3) of the Code have been proven beyond a reasonable doubt. 4) The evidence discloses that the police officer made numerous efforts to ensure the accused actually spoke to a lawyer in private. After that, the accused made no further requests whatsoever to further speak to a lawyer. Following the principles set forth by the Saskatchewan Court of Appeal in R. v. Leedahl, 2002 SKCA 5, the evidence clearly establishes the accused was coherent and understood the right to counsel enunciated to him by the police officer. He in fact spoke to a lawyer and made no other requests. Further, there was no suggestion that the accused was incapable of understanding his right to counsel or that he was incapable or prevented from acting on his right. To the contrary, the evidence proves the exact opposite. The Court finds the accused has failed to demonstrate his s. 10(b) right to counsel was denied or infringed in any way.","The accused was charged with impaired care or control of a motor vehicle contrary to s.255(1) and s.253(b) of the Criminal Code. The accused had consumed alcohol in such a quantity that the concentration thereof in his blood exceeded eighty milligrams of alcohol in one hundred millilitres of blood. The Crown called all its evidence on the first date and the matter was adjourned over two lengthy adjournments for the possibility of calling an expert in relation to the neurological condition of the accused. Defence raised a number of issues which were summarized as follows: 1) Since the vehicle was inoperable as a result of an accident, the accused may be incapable of providing a sample of his breath, or it would be impracticable to obtain a sample. He was completely justified in holding that belief. The evidence has proven the accused required immediate and emergent medical attention which made it impractical to put the accused before a breathalyzer instrument within the time limit fixed by the Code. 2) The Court found the accused was 'in care' of the motor vehicle pursuant to the presumption in s.258(1)(a). The court found that the accused had reasonable and probable grounds to believe he was in care and control of the vehicle. The Court concluded that the officer was sensitive to the immediate concern of the physical well-being of the victim and he wisely waited until medical personnel made an initial assessment at the hospital before making any kind of demand. The totality of the evidence would lead any reasonable person to that conclusion. 3) The accused failed to demonstrate his s.10(b)(c) right to counsel was denied or infringed in any way. The court held that the Court must be mindful that he had previous experience as an emergency medical technician and would have knowledge of head and spinal injury trauma procedures, including head and neck trauma procedures. 4) The court concluded that there might not well exist circumstances, for instance, in which the accused might not have been able to fully understand his rights or fully exercise them when he in fact spoke to a lawyer.","[1] The accused stands charged as follows:

The accused was sitting in the driver's seat with his seat belt on when the accident occurred and he did not ask to speak to a lawyer. At issue was whether the police officer had reasonable and probable grounds to make a blood sample demand and whether the accused was in care or control of the vehicle. HELD: 1)Since the vehicle was inoperable as a result of an accident, with no risk of setting it in motion, the Court found that the accused had'reasonable and probable ground' to believe that by reason of his physical condition, the accused may be incapable of providing a sample of his breath, or it would be impracticable to obtain a sample. All of the requirements of s. 254(3) have been proven beyond a reasonable doubt. 2)The Court reviewed the principles it had established in R. v.

The evidence established that the officer had probable and probable reasons to believe the accused could not provide a breath sample either because of his condition and the smell of alcohol from the vehicle; 4)There was no evidence concerning the accused's position in relation to the medical condition of the accused and no suggestion that he was incapable or prevented from acting on his right. Having found that such a belief is not supported by the evidence, the court concludes that the Court must be mindful that he had previous experience as an emergency medical technician and would have knowledge of head and spinal injury trauma procedures at the hospital, including time in the hospital for an assessment; 5)The court also concludes that there is nothing in the language used in the authorities dealing with the death of an accused that would justify a demand for a sample","[1] The accused stands charged as follows:

In the circumstances, the Court finds the officer made the demand at the first practical opportunity in relation to the entire investigation. 3) The officer, in coming to his conclusion to make a blood sample demand, considered a number of relevant factors, including time limits to obtain a breath sample, the severity and magnitude of the accident, the potential seriousness of the accused's head and neck injuries, the need for immediate emergency assessment and length of time it would take to treat the accused and keep him under observation. He believed the accused's condition was potentially serious and was completely justified in holding that belief. The evidence has proven the accused required immediate and emergent medical attention which made it obviously impractical to put the accused before a breathalyzer instrument within the time limit fixed by the Code. The officer had reasonable and probable grounds to believe that by reason of his physical condition, the accused may be incapable of providing a sample of his breath, or it would be impracticable to obtain a sample of his breath. All the requirements of s. 254(3) of the Code have been proven beyond a reasonable doubt. 4) The evidence discloses that the police officer made numerous efforts to ensure the accused actually spoke to a lawyer in private. After that, the accused made no further requests whatsoever to further speak to a lawyer. Following the principles set forth by the Saskatchewan Court of Appeal in R. v. Leedahl, 2002 SKCA 5, the evidence clearly establishes the accused was coherent and understood the right to counsel enunciated to him by the police officer. He in fact spoke to a lawyer and made no other requests. Further, there was no suggestion that the accused was incapable of understanding his right to counsel or that he was incapable or prevented from acting on his right. To the contrary, the evidence proves the exact opposite. The Court finds the accused has failed to demonstrate his s. 10(b) right to counsel was denied or infringed in any way.","The accused was charged with operating a motor vehicle while impaired contrary to s.255(1) and s.253(a) of the Criminal Code and with having consumed alcohol in such a quantity that his blood alcohol concentration exceeded 80 milligrams of alcohol in 100 millilitres of blood contrary to section 253(b) and (a)of the Code. The accused was sitting in the driver's seat with his seat belt on when the accident occurred and he did not ask to speak to a lawyer. At issue was whether the police officer had reasonable and probable grounds to make a blood sample demand and whether the accused was in care or control of the vehicle. HELD: 1)Since the vehicle was inoperable as a result of an accident, with no risk of setting it in motion, the Court found that the accused had'reasonable and probable ground' to believe that by reason of his physical condition, the accused may be incapable of providing a sample of his breath, or it would be impracticable to obtain a sample. All of the requirements of s. 254(3) have been proven beyond a reasonable doubt. 2)The Court reviewed the principles it had established in R. v. Leedahl and reviewed Schnell's dominant or controlling purpose during the critical overlap period and held that once the accused rebutted the presumption in s.258(1)(a), the court could not enter the analysis of whether the de facto care or controls of an inoperability motor vehicle was denied or infringed in any way. 3)The accused had reasonable, probable and reasonable grounds to believe (and in fact did believe) that the vehicle as contemplated by the Criminal code for the purposes of care and control was impaired by alcohol. The evidence established that the officer had probable and probable reasons to believe the accused could not provide a breath sample either because of his condition and the smell of alcohol from the vehicle; 4)There was no evidence concerning the accused's position in relation to the medical condition of the accused and no suggestion that he was incapable or prevented from acting on his right. Having found that such a belief is not supported by the evidence, the court concludes that the Court must be mindful that he had previous experience as an emergency medical technician and would have knowledge of head and spinal injury trauma procedures at the hospital, including time in the hospital for an assessment; 5)The court also concludes that there is nothing in the language used in the authorities dealing with the death of an accused that would justify a demand for a sample","[1] The accused stands charged as follows:

1) on or about the 23rd day of January, A.D. 2004 at or near Saskatoon, Saskatchewan did while his ability to operate a motor vehicle was impaired by alcohol or a drug have the care or control of a motor vehicle contrary to section 255(1) and section 253(a) of the Criminal Code. 2) on or about the 23rd day of January, A.D. 2004 at or near Saskatoon, Saskatchewan did having consumed alcohol in such quantity that the concentration thereof in his blood exceeded eighty milligrams of alcohol in one hundred millilitres of blood have care or control of a motor vehicle contrary to section 253(b) of the Criminal Code. The accused has failed to rebut the presumption of care or control under s. 258(1)(a). The court hereby finds the accused was “in care or control” of the motor vehicle pursuant to the presumption in s. 258(1)(a). [29] Considering the case law, the submissions of counsel and after objectively considering all the indicia of impairment known to the officer, together with the circumstances of the accident itself (which indicated driving error), there can be no doubt the officer had more than reasonable and probable grounds to form the requisite opinion pursuant to s. 254(3) to make a demand for samples of analysis. In the circumstances, the court finds the officer made the demand at the first practical opportunity in relation to the entire investigation. [34] I find as a fact he, in coming to his conclusion to make a blood sample demand, considered a number of relevant factors, including time limits to obtain a breath sample, the severity and magnitude of the accident, the potential seriousness of the accused’s head and neck injuries, the need for immediate emergency assessment and length of time it would take to treat the accused and keep him under observation. The evidence has proven the accused required immediate and emergent medical attention which made it obviously impractical to put the accused before a breathalyzer instrument within the time limit fixed by the Code. [35] Considering the foregoing, I find Officer Kiesman had reasonable and probable grounds to believe (and in fact did believe) that by reason of his physical condition, the accused may be incapable of providing a sample of his breath, or it would be impracticable to obtain a sample of his breath. All of the requirements of s. 254(3) have been proven beyond a reasonable doubt. The evidence discloses Officer Kiesman made numerous efforts to ensure the accused actually spoke to a lawyer in private. The court finds the accused has failed to demonstrate his s. 10(b) right to counsel was denied or infringed in any way. [37] Having found as above, there is no remedy of exclusion of the Certificate of Analysis, Exhibit P1 in these proceedings. [38] Accordingly, the court finds the accused guilty of count 2, being care or control with a blood alcohol content in excess of .08. [39] As to count 1, care or control while impaired, the evidence clearly does not prove impairment beyond a reasonable doubt, as envisaged by the case law, including: The court finds the accused not guilty of count 1, being impaired care or control.",0.32464929859719444,"The accused was charged with impaired care or control of a motor vehicle contrary to s.255(1) and s.253(b) of the Criminal Code. The accused had consumed alcohol in such a quantity that the concentration thereof in his blood exceeded eighty milligrams of alcohol in one hundred millilitres of blood. The Crown called all its evidence on the first date and the matter was adjourned over two lengthy adjournments for the possibility of calling an expert in relation to the neurological condition of the accused. Defence raised a number of issues which were summarized as follows: 1) Since the vehicle was inoperable as a result of an accident, the accused may be incapable of providing a sample of his breath, or it would be impracticable to obtain a sample. He was completely justified in holding that belief. The evidence has proven the accused required immediate and emergent medical attention which made it impractical to put the accused before a breathalyzer instrument within the time limit fixed by the Code. 2) The Court found the accused was 'in care' of the motor vehicle pursuant to the presumption in s.258(1)(a). The court found that the accused had reasonable and probable grounds to believe he was in care and control of the vehicle. The Court concluded that the officer was sensitive to the immediate concern of the physical well-being of the victim and he wisely waited until medical personnel made an initial assessment at the hospital before making any kind of demand. The totality of the evidence would lead any reasonable person to that conclusion. 3) The accused failed to demonstrate his s.10(b)(c) right to counsel was denied or infringed in any way. The court held that the Court must be mindful that he had previous experience as an emergency medical technician and would have knowledge of head and spinal injury trauma procedures, including head and neck trauma procedures. 4) The court concluded that there might not well exist circumstances, for instance, in which the accused might not have been able to fully understand his rights or fully exercise them when he in fact spoke to a lawyer.",0.27808471454880296

The parents separated in October of 2003. They agreed to an order of joint custody with the child primarily residing with the petitioner. The petitioner wishes to move with the respondent from Saskatoon to Edmonton and Harley is opposed to such a move. HELD: 1) The child's primary residence is with his mother so long as she remains in the City of Saskatoon. If she chooses to relocate, the petitioner will become an access parent and the children will no longer benefit from his co-parenting. 2) Based on the loss of Harley as an active parent coupled with Charlene's vague and uncertain plans for the child's care in Edmonton the child is not in the best interests of the child. The parties agreed that there should be an order for joint custody and provided Charlene remained in Saskatoon, the child would lose contact with his extended family in Edmonton. The issue that am to determine is whether it is in Keeler's best interest to relocate from Saskatchewan to Edmonton. This is the first determination of residence of the petitioner given that the order of June 16, 2004 was an interim order. The issues are as follows: 1. Is it in the children's best interests to relocate to Edmonton? 2) What is an appropriate access schedule for Harley to be with?  3) The children's law act s.6(5) mandates that a child should have as much contact with each parent as is consistent with the best interest of his or her child and, for that purpose, what is the ideal access schedule.

c_1999skqb178.txt,"Custody, child support and division of matrimonial property were in dispute. The mother was awarded interim custody of the three children in 1997. The father was ordered to pay child support of $405 per month but had made only one voluntary payment of $100. He agreed to abandon his appeal of the order for sale of the matrimonial home. He had been unable to obtain financing to buy out her share. The father, unrepresented by counsel, sought to have selected portions of 14 hours of taped telephone conversations with the children and wife admitted into evidence. He insisted the tapes were of central importance to his case; that they discredited the conclusions of the custody and access report and demonstrated abuse was occurring in the mother's home. HELD: 1)Sole custody was awarded to the mother. The father was to have access Friday from 5:00 p.m. until Tuesday at 9:00 every second weekend. 2)The tapes were admitted in their totality, unedited. The two lines of cases respecting the admission of audiotapes in a custody hearing were reviewed. The tapes had the opposite effect to the father's intent. The father 'alternatively interrogated the children about their mother; prompted them to make unfavourable comments about her; magnified every incident of childish squabbling into a crisis; magnified the children's distress over the marital breakdown, encouraged the children to run to his home at every opportunity; and generally undermined the mother's parental authority at every available turn.' The petitioner's depression had been ascribed to environmental stresses rather than innate. The father acknowledged that his drinking had lessened but not discontinued as he suggested in the custody and access report. 3)The property was to be sold. The father was responsible for mortgage payments from July 1998 until the date of sale as he had stopped making mortgage payments after the previous order while continuing to reside in the home. A corresponding adjustment in the net sale proceeds was to be made in the wife's favour. Child maintenance was to be satisfied from the father's share of the sale proceeds. 4)The mother's employment pension was to be divided equally and one half rolled into an RRSP designated by the father. RRSP's were to be divided equally. Furniture, furnishings and personal effects in their possession would be retained by each party. Hunting clothes or supplies and one half of the family photographs were to be returned to the father. The loan from the respondent's mother was statute-barred. No repayments had been made in 10 years. The debt for the half ton acquired after separation was the father's sole responsibility. 5)The prior order of $405 for child support remained in effect. The father made no income disclosure until trial and evidence of his 1991 income was unsatisfactory. Rental income was deemed to his 1998 income. No order was made for day care costs due to inadequate proof. The parties could seek a review if more comprehensive evidence were produced. 6)Judgment for divorce would be made final on the expiration of 31 days.","Although custody was the most conspicuous issue in this proceeding, there were also questions of child support and division of matrimonial property that required resolution before the parties could put an end to their acrimonious marital breakdown. The father was unrepresented at trial with the unfortunate result that these proceedings became an extended replay of past domestic arguments. HELD: Custody was granted to the father with access to the mother. Access was to commence January 1, 1998. The mother was adamant that the custody and access assessor never obtained an honest opinion from the children and the Court should not avoid the opportunity to hear the children in their own words. 1) The tapes were inadmissible unless their authenticity was established, they are shown to be true and unaltered record, and the voices have been properly identified. 2) The father had no redeeming excuse for such calculated, offensive and immature behaviour. He had exploited the children's unhappiness at every turn and incited and encouraged willful and unruly behaviour to suit his own purposes. 3) There were numerous conversations between the father and the children, either individually or all together. There was really very little involving the mother directly. The parties were involved in aprotracted pattern of dysfunctional, conflictual communication and having regard in particular to the age and unwavering antagonism of the two eldest children, the father had made only one voluntary payment of $100 in January, 1998 and otherwise ignored the maintenance order until garnishees were implemented by the Maintenance Enforcement Office. He was to have access on his scheduled days off work. 4) There was no evidence that the father was seeking out disagreement, no matter how trivial. Only by hearing the tapes could the Court truly understand the petitioner's violent nature and her dysfunctional relationships with the children.","[1] Although custody was the most conspicuous issue in this proceeding, there are questions of child support and division of matrimonial property that require resolution before the parties can put an end to their acrimonious marital breakdown. [17] With the same degree of repugnance, and with the utmost reluctance, I allowed the tapes to be admitted here in their totality, but on the condition they went in unedited. [18] After listening to the tapes in their entirety, I am of the view they have the opposite effect. I am of a view that sole custody must be awarded to the mother. [31] The petitioner will have sole custody of the three children. [32] On the matrimonial property issues, the order of Noble J. should now be implemented and the property sold. As the respondent stopped making the mortgagee payments after that order, but has continued to reside in the matrimonial home, I am of the view he should bear responsibility for the mortgage payments from July 1, 1998 until the date of sale and there will be a corresponding adjustment of the net sale proceeds in the wife’s favour. As well, the arrears of child maintenance as calculated by the Maintenance Enforcement Office to the date of sale should be satisfied from the respondent’s share of the sale proceeds.

The mother was awarded interim custody of the three children in 1997. The father was ordered to pay child support of $405 per month but had made only one voluntary payment of $100. He agreed to abandon his appeal of the order for sale of the matrimonial home. He had been unable to obtain financing to buy out her share. The father, unrepresented by counsel, sought to have selected portions of 14 hours of taped telephone conversations with the children and wife admitted into evidence. He insisted the tapes were of central importance to his case; that they discredited the conclusions of the custody and access report and demonstrated abuse was occurring in the mother's home. HELD: 1)Sole custody was awarded to the mother. The father was to have access Friday from 5:00 p.m. until Tuesday at 9:00 every second weekend. 2)The tapes were admitted in their totality, unedited. The two lines of cases respecting the admission of audiotapes in a custody hearing were reviewed. The tapes had the opposite effect to the father's intent. The father 'alternatively interrogated the children about their mother; prompted them to make unfavourable comments about her; magnified every incident of childish squabbling into a crisis; magnified the children's distress over the marital breakdown, encouraged the children to run to his home at every opportunity; and generally undermined the mother's parental authority at every available turn.' The petitioner's depression had been ascribed to environmental stresses rather than innate. The father acknowledged that his drinking had lessened but not discontinued as he suggested in the custody and access report. 3)The property was to be sold. The father was responsible for mortgage payments from July 1998 until the date of sale as he had stopped making mortgage payments after the previous order while continuing to reside in the home. A corresponding adjustment in the net sale proceeds was to be made in the wife's favour. Child maintenance was to be satisfied from the father's share of the sale proceeds. 4)The mother's employment pension was to be divided equally and one half rolled into an RRSP designated by the father. RRSP's were to be divided equally. Furniture, furnishings and personal effects in their possession would be retained by each party. Hunting clothes or supplies and one half of the family photographs were to be returned to the father. The loan from the respondent's mother was statute-barred. No repayments had been made in 10 years. The debt for the half ton acquired after separation was the father's sole responsibility. 5)The prior order of $405 for child support remained in effect. The father made no income disclosure until trial and evidence of his 1991 income was unsatisfactory. Rental income was deemed to his 1998 income. No order was made for day care costs due to inadequate proof. The parties could seek a review if more comprehensive evidence were produced. 6)Judgment for divorce would be made final on the expiration of 31 days.","Although custody was the most conspicuous issue in this proceeding, there are questions of child support and division of matrimonial property that require resolution before the parties can put an end to their acrimonious marital breakdown. The father was unrepresented at trial with the unfortunate result that these proceedings became an extended replay of past domestic arguments. HELD: 1) Although the mother's recognition of past problems with depression and her progress in dealing with it through medication and counselling, the Court found that the tapes were of central importance to the mother and that they discredited the conclusions of the custody and access report and demonstrated the abuse that was occurring in the mother’s home.  2) The tapes were primarily conversations between the father and the children, either individually or all together. There is really very little involving the mother directly. The keynote theme, as orchestrated by the father, is that the mother is deranged and violent but the father will always be there to rescue the children.

The Partnerships sustained heavy operating losses since 1989 and the petitioners had made large capital contributions on behalf of the defaulting partners in order to prevent the Partnerships from defaulting on the mortgages. The defaulting partners obtained the benefits of business losses which they used to offset their other sources of income and to decrease their personal income tax liability by significant amounts, obtaining benefits without paying for them. The petitioners alleged that Ashton had committed three acts of bankruptcy within the six months prior to filing the petition including ceasing to pay liabilities as they became due in failing to make payments to the petitioners, making a fraudulent conveyance to his wife and disposing of his property with intent to defraud or defeat his creditors by permitting his interest in the Securities to be purportedly seized by his wife.

Relying upon the accountant's advice, the petitioner brothers invested in these partnerships.

The petitioner's business losses have always been allocated equally among the partners and claimed by each of the partners as personal business losses on an equal basis.

4_2015skca111.txt,"Family – Child Support – Arrears – Appeal The appellant appealed from the decision of a Queen’s Bench judge ordering him to pay retroactive child support to the respondent in the amount of $21,645. The order indicated that the period in question would include support from January 2009 to August 2012 (see: 2014 SKQB 334). An original support order was issued by consent in 2006. It required that the appellant pay the respondent $1,220 per month in child support and that the parties would exchange their financial information yearly in order to adjust the amount of child support payable. In 2008, the appellant applied to vary the order because he had lost his position and his income was reduced to $1,500 per month. In his affidavit, he swore that his annual income would be $18,000. The application was allowed and the amount of support reduced to $769 per month based upon the judge setting the appellant’s income at $55,000 and directing him to provide his financial information to the respondent each year. One month later in 2009, the appellant regained his former employment position and began earning as much as he had in 2008 but he continued to pay $769 per month without informing the respondent of the change in his circumstances. In February 2011, the respondent served a notice to disclose. The parties met and made an oral agreement that the appellant would pay $950 per month based upon the appellant’s claim that he was still financially strapped and the respondent acquiesced because she was unwilling to engage in further court battles with him. The appellant’s lawyer provided the respondent’s lawyer with financial information that showed that the former was earning a substantially higher income. The respondent also indicated to the appellant that she would forgo about $7,200 in arrears. The terms of the agreement were submitted to the court, without the financial information or the respondent’s forbearance to sue, and a variation order was issued based upon them. In July 2012, the respondent applied to vary the 2008 order and the 2011 variation order claiming arrears from January 2009. Eventually the issue of retroactive child support went to trial. The trial judge found that the appellant had not given the respondent financial information as was required and his failure to inform her of the material change in his circumstances in 2009 constituted blameworthy conduct. The appellant’s income for the years 2009 through 2012 was assessed by the court and the amount of arrears established. The appellant argued that: 1) the trial judge did not have the jurisdiction to vary the 2011 variation order. He maintained that the 2011 order was final and could not be varied on an interim basis; 2) it was necessary to find a material change in circumstances before it could be varied; 3) the respondent had been advised of the change in circumstances; and 4) the trial judge had erred in failing to find unreasonable delay on the part of the respondent.  HELD: The appeal was dismissed. The court held with respect to each issue that: 1) a court can vary an interim or a final order on an interim basis for child support under the authority of ss. 15 and 17 of the Divorce Act. Although it might be necessary in some cases to determine whether an order is final or interim, it was not necessary to do so here because the nature of the terms of the orders in question and the circumstances surrounding the granting of the 2011 variation order. The trial judge had not erred in concluding that he had authority to vary it and to order the appellant to pay arrears before the agreement and compelling him to pay the Guideline amount for the period following it; 2) the terms of the 2011 order left it to a future court to finalize the amount of child support based upon the appellant’s income. Therefore the court retained the power to vary or rescind the order without searching for a change in circumstances; 3) the trial judge’s findings of fact on this point were supported by the evidence; and 4) the trial judge found that the respondent had not received disclosure and thus there had been no unreasonable delay.","HELD: The appeal was dismissed. The court found that Turcotte J. could not overturn a decision of a different court dealing with the same lis. It also held that the court could not vary a final order on an interim basis pursuant to s.17. The Court reviewed the jurisprudence of the past 10 years and found that the courts lack the authority to vary final orders on a matter of jurisdiction, especially when it comes to child support orders.","Appeal dismissed [1] This is an appeal from the decision of Turcotte J. on October 16, 2014, ordering Daniel Prescesky to pay retroactive child support to his former wife, Mandy Lantz, in the amount of $21,645 and costs in the amount of $1,500 (Prescesky v Prescesky, 2014 SKQB 334 (CanLII), 456 Sask R 306 [Prescesky]). Analysis [28] Mr. Prescesky submits that Turcotte J. erred: (i) by varying the 2011 Variation Order, which he submits was a final order issued by consent of the parties in accordance with their prior agreement; (ii) by varying the 2011 Variation Order without first finding a material change in circumstances; (iii) by misapprehending the facts when he found Mr. Prescesky did not advise Ms. Lantz of changes to his circumstances; and (iv) by misapprehending the facts by failing to find unreasonable delay. (a) Did Turcotte J. have the jurisdiction to vary the 2011 Variation Order? (b) Was it necessary to find a material change in circumstances before the 2011 Variation Order could be varied? A. Did Turcotte J. have the jurisdiction to vary the 2011 Variation Order? [35] Second, he argues that in the area of family support orders, the courts draw a clear distinction between interim orders, which can be varied on an interim basis as a matter of jurisdiction, and final orders. Whether the Court can vary an interim or a final order on an interim basis for child support is governed not by common law principles, but by the Divorce Act, RSC 1985, c 3 (2d Supp). [53] I will now turn to consider the nature of the orders in question and the authority that can be invoked to sustain their variation. [72] In short, I conclude that Turcotte J. did not err by concluding he had the authority to vary the 2011 Variation Order and to order Mr. Prescesky to pay arrears arsing before it and compelling him to pay the Guidelines amount for the period following it. B. Was it necessary to find a material change in circumstances before the 2011 Variation Order could be varied? By the terms of the 2011 Variation Order, the parties left to a future court the finalization of the amount of child support based on Mr. Prescesky’s income.  Faced with this state of affairs and these words, the Court of Queen’s Bench retained the power to vary or rescind the order without searching for a change in circumstances. [77] Turcotte J. also found that “there was no unreasonable delay on Mandy’s part in seeking a retroactive review of Daniel’s child support obligation” (para. 48). [78] The appeal is dismissed.",0.15355086372360843,"Family – Child Support – Arrears – Appeal The appellant appealed from the decision of a Queen’s Bench judge ordering him to pay retroactive child support to the respondent in the amount of $21,645. The order indicated that the period in question would include support from January 2009 to August 2012 (see: 2014 SKQB 334). An original support order was issued by consent in 2006. It required that the appellant pay the respondent $1,220 per month in child support and that the parties would exchange their financial information yearly in order to adjust the amount of child support payable. In 2008, the appellant applied to vary the order because he had lost his position and his income was reduced to $1,500 per month. In his affidavit, he swore that his annual income would be $18,000. The application was allowed and the amount of support reduced to $769 per month based upon the judge setting the appellant’s income at $55,000 and directing him to provide his financial information to the respondent each year. One month later in 2009, the appellant regained his former employment position and began earning as much as he had in 2008 but he continued to pay $769 per month without informing the respondent of the change in his circumstances. In February 2011, the respondent served a notice to disclose. The parties met and made an oral agreement that the appellant would pay $950 per month based upon the appellant’s claim that he was still financially strapped and the respondent acquiesced because she was unwilling to engage in further court battles with him. The appellant’s lawyer provided the respondent’s lawyer with financial information that showed that the former was earning a substantially higher income. The respondent also indicated to the appellant that she would forgo about $7,200 in arrears. The terms of the agreement were submitted to the court, without the financial information or the respondent’s forbearance to sue, and a variation order was issued based upon them. In July 2012, the respondent applied to vary the 2008 order and the 2011 variation order claiming arrears from January 2009. Eventually the issue of retroactive child support went to trial. The trial judge found that the appellant had not given the respondent financial information as was required and his failure to inform her of the material change in his circumstances in 2009 constituted blameworthy conduct. The appellant’s income for the years 2009 through 2012 was assessed by the court and the amount of arrears established. The appellant argued that: 1) the trial judge did not have the jurisdiction to vary the 2011 variation order. He maintained that the 2011 order was final and could not be varied on an interim basis; 2) it was necessary to find a material change in circumstances before it could be varied; 3) the respondent had been advised of the change in circumstances; and 4) the trial judge had erred in failing to find unreasonable delay on the part of the respondent.  HELD: The appeal was dismissed. The court held with respect to each issue that: 1) a court can vary an interim or a final order on an interim basis for child support under the authority of ss. 15 and 17 of the Divorce Act. Although it might be necessary in some cases to determine whether an order is final or interim, it was not necessary to do so here because the nature of the terms of the orders in question and the circumstances surrounding the granting of the 2011 variation order. The trial judge had not erred in concluding that he had authority to vary it and to order the appellant to pay arrears before the agreement and compelling him to pay the Guideline amount for the period following it; 2) the terms of the 2011 order left it to a future court to finalize the amount of child support based upon the appellant’s income. Therefore the court retained the power to vary or rescind the order without searching for a change in circumstances; 3) the trial judge’s findings of fact on this point were supported by the evidence; and 4) the trial judge found that the respondent had not received disclosure and thus there had been no unreasonable delay.","In October 2014, Turcotte J. ordered the defendant to pay retroactive child support to his former wife in the amount of $21,645. The parties agreed in May 2011 to vary the 2011 Variation Order to reflect the amount payable pursuant to the Federal Child Support Guidelines. In December 2011, the defendant abandoned his request to change the primary residence of his ex-wife to that of his current one. He applied to the Court of Queen's Bench for an order varying the 2006 Consent Child Support Order to include the change in custody of his two children. The Court found in December 2011 that the defendant had exceeded his means in paying the child support he was owed for the period from January 2009 to August 2012 inclusive. In May 2011, a variation order was issued which reduced the defendant’s monthly child support payment to $950 from $1,000 per month. The defendant filed an application for variation of the variation order in which he alleged that he had been required to pay $2,000 less per month in the previous variation order and that he should not have instructed his solicitor to consent to it. The applicant argued that the trial judge erred by misapprehending facts when he found the defendant did not advise him of changes to his circumstances and by failing to find unreasonable delay. HELD: The appeal was dismissed. 1)Saskatchewan courts draw a clear distinction between interim orders, which can be varied on an interim basis as a matter of jurisdiction, and final orders. 2)Canadian courts have not followed Frey. In his decision regarding the 2006 consent order, he held that there was no expressly legislated power to vary an interim order on an application pursuant to s.17 of the Divorce Act. In this case, the court referred to the decision in Frey Frey (1987), 1987 CanLII 4734 (SK CA), RFL (3d) 154 (Sask.) at para 12. The court reviewed the various orders of the Court in the past 10 years and found that: 1)The Court found that the parties had not reached an agreement on the extent to which the defendant was entitled to vary his consent order in accordance with the Guidelines; 2)There was no evidence that either party was aware of the material changes to their circumstances; 3)The defendant failed to inform the plaintiff of the 2009 material changes or to have adjusted his child support accordingly. 4)The court found that a consent order can only be varied if it is necessary to change circumstances. 5)A spousal","Appeal dismissed [1] This is an appeal from the decision of Turcotte J. on October 16, 2014, ordering Daniel Prescesky to pay retroactive child support to his former wife, Mandy Lantz, in the amount of $21,645 and costs in the amount of $1,500 (Prescesky v Prescesky, 2014 SKQB 334 (CanLII), 456 Sask R 306 [Prescesky]). Analysis [28] Mr. Prescesky submits that Turcotte J. erred: (i) by varying the 2011 Variation Order, which he submits was a final order issued by consent of the parties in accordance with their prior agreement; (ii) by varying the 2011 Variation Order without first finding a material change in circumstances; (iii) by misapprehending the facts when he found Mr. Prescesky did not advise Ms. Lantz of changes to his circumstances; and (iv) by misapprehending the facts by failing to find unreasonable delay. (a) Did Turcotte J. have the jurisdiction to vary the 2011 Variation Order? (b) Was it necessary to find a material change in circumstances before the 2011 Variation Order could be varied? A. Did Turcotte J. have the jurisdiction to vary the 2011 Variation Order? [35] Second, he argues that in the area of family support orders, the courts draw a clear distinction between interim orders, which can be varied on an interim basis as a matter of jurisdiction, and final orders. Whether the Court can vary an interim or a final order on an interim basis for child support is governed not by common law principles, but by the Divorce Act, RSC 1985, c 3 (2d Supp). [53] I will now turn to consider the nature of the orders in question and the authority that can be invoked to sustain their variation. [72] In short, I conclude that Turcotte J. did not err by concluding he had the authority to vary the 2011 Variation Order and to order Mr. Prescesky to pay arrears arsing before it and compelling him to pay the Guidelines amount for the period following it. B. Was it necessary to find a material change in circumstances before the 2011 Variation Order could be varied? By the terms of the 2011 Variation Order, the parties left to a future court the finalization of the amount of child support based on Mr. Prescesky’s income.

The complainant admitted that he threw the first punch but said that he did so because the male accused had already broken the windows in his car and punched his passenger and was not 'coming to apologize.' HELD: The accused were convicted of assault. Whether the physical altercation was precipitated by jealousy or a drug deal, there is no doubt that the accused was the aggressor throughout. He smashed one, if not two, car windows. The accused's behaviour was threatening and the Court accepted that the accused had not attended the house to apologize. The complainant took necessary and lawful action to protect himself and his family under s. 37 of the Criminal Code.  While the Court did not believe that either complainant used a weapon, if it did occur it would have been justified in the context of the assault. The accused was acquitted of mischief because the Crown failed to prove the value of the broken windows.","The two accused were charged on separate informations with assaulting the complainant. The charges all arose out of the same incident. The Crown and the defence were allowed to call all of their evidence at the trial on one information, which would all be applied over to the other information. The Court found that the accused were both the aggressors throughout. He smashed in one, if not two, car windows, he chased after the complainant and then punched her in the face. The rear window of the car was smashed in. HELD: The accused were found not guilty of the first count on information 24414281.  1) The actions of the accused and the manner in which they were attacked were aggressive and the accused took necessary and lawful action to protect themselves and their family. There was no evidence of an essential element of the offence which was supported by the testimony of the main accused. 2) The two accused admitted to breaking the front passenger window and he probably broke the rear window. However, the Crown was unable to prove the cost of repairing the windows was under $5,000. 3) The Court accepted the accused's testimony that they were involved in a fistfight and that the altercation was unnecessary and it was unnecessary for them to use force. They both admitted to getting involved in the altercation and that they both felt threatened.  4) The accused admitted that he choked the complainant at one point during the fight and that he punched the complainant three times. The complainant's testimony was contradicted by the other witness who testified that she had been drinking alcohol at the time of the altercation.  5) With respect to the count of wilful damage to the car, the Court agreed with this procedure. The trial proceeded on information 24614281 and at the close of the trial the Crown and defence evidence was applied to and became the evidence on Information 24417999.  6) The injuries were consistent with fistfights. The defendant was aggressive. She punched the plaintiff three times and he fell off the stairs towards the trailer.  7) The evidence submitted by the accused was that they got into a fist fight in the parking lot of a strip mall. There were lots of punches and kicks by the two accused and they were standing up and punching each other. The plaintiff was forced to walk away from the scene of the assault. The accused choked the plaintiff and he was punched three times while he was standing on the stairs.  8) The court found that although the accused may have been involved in an unnecessary altercation, they were not involved in","[1] Jeremy Angelo Mayer (Mayer) and Aimee Lynn Dagenais (Dagenais) are charged on separate informations with assaulting Jared McIntyre contrary to s. 266 of the Criminal Code.

[2] On April 18, 1996 a car driven by 16 year old Andrew Larkin veered off the road and struck a power pole on Route 359, Centerville, Nova Scotia. The driver said that he swerved to avoid hitting a dog that ran onto the highway in front of the car. They also named Theodore Hogeterp as a defendant. Mr. Hogeterp was a farmer who owned land on both sides of the road at the site of the accident. The application for summary judgment is therefore dismissed. The order of the chambers judge should be confirmed, although for different reasons. [41] I would grant leave to appeal but dismiss the appeal.",0.21176470588235297,"A single vehicle accident occurred when the driver swerved to avoid hitting a dog that ran onto the highway. An action was brought against both the driver and the farmer who owned the land on both sides of the highway on the basis that the farmer owned the dog in question and was negligent in failing to keep it off the highway. The farmer contended that although he owned a dog, it was tied to a tree at the time and his was not the dog that had run onto the highway. When his application for summary judgment was dismissed, the farmer appealed. Appeal dismissed. At this stage of the proceedings, it was not necessary for the plaintiffs to prove that the defendant's dog contributed to the accident or the truth of the statements and evidence attached to the affidavit. It was only necessary to show that the facts were contested, there was some evidence to support their version of events and, if their evidence was accepted by the trier of fact, their action had some merit. Although the judge appeared to blur the two parts of the test on a summary judgment application, the Court found that the farmer failed to meet the first part of the test; namely, that there was no genuine issue of fact for trial as there was conflicting evidence as to the identity of the dog involved.","The defendant applied to have the Court of Appeal dismiss his summary judgment application on the basis that the chambers judge erred in the application of the test for summary judgment. The chambers judge admitted that the defendant had provided conflicting statements regarding the dog and the fact that it ran onto the highway. The defendant argued that there was no arguable issue to be tried on the application and dismissed the application. The issues were: 1) which affidavit was read and signed by the defendant; 2) which evidence was attached to the affidavit; and 3) which portions of the defendant's discovery evidence, including the statement of the officer who had examined the dog at the scene of the accident, were not properly presented through the other affidavits. The Chambers judge did not refer at all to the real chance of success test; and 4) the onus did not shift to the plaintiffs to show that their claim had a real prospect of success. All of these issues were dealt with in the chambers decision.","Held: Leave to appeal is granted and the appeal is dismissed with costs, per reasons for judgment of Roscoe, J.A.; [1] This is an application for leave to appeal and, if granted, an appeal from an order of Justice Glen G.

8_2015skqb144.txt,"The court concluded that the respondent was not a credible, trustworthy, or reliable witness for many reasons. The petitioner, on the other hand, was found to be a truthful and reliable witness. The court was also impressed with the petitioner’s witnesses because they were close family members, long-time friends, and her live-in partner. By contrast, the respondent’s witnesses were friends seen from time to time, neighbours, and his mother. The court found the respondent’s mother to be evasive and guarded at times. To determine custody the court reviewed the factors set out in s. 8 of The Children’s Law Act, 1997. The petitioner was found to be the primary parent of the child since his birth. The court was left with a degree of uncertainty as to the day-to-day activities of the child when he was with the respondent. The quality of the child’s relationship with the petitioner was found to substantially exceed that of the respondent’s relationship with the child. The court accepted that the child said disturbing things upon his return to the petitioner from the respondent. The child’s need for a stable, reassuring, and positive home were found to be met in the petitioner’s home. The court indicated that decreasing the respondent’s time with the child may ameliorate the adverse effect on the child’s emotional needs. The child was also found to be afforded more social fulfillment in the petitioner’s care. The petitioner also had more constructive plans for the child’s future. The respondent’s negativity towards the petitioner was found to negatively impact his ability to parent. The court concluded that it was in the child’s best interests to primarily reside with the petitioner. The petitioner was granted sole custody of the child so as to minimize further conflict between the parties. The respondent was given unsupervised access every other weekend. The court added $5,000 to the petitioner’s line 150 income for the personal component of her vehicle expense deduction. After determining the respondent’s income the court found that the s. 3 Guideline child support due by the respondent to the petitioner was $676 per month and that he should be responsible for 37 percent of the s. 7 expenses. The petitioner did not request child support but instead asked the court to consider it in the distribution of property. The respondent discharged the onus of establishing a common-law relationship of two or more years. The respondent’s pension value available for division was found to be $11,663.97.  The court did not find an extraordinary circumstance to warrant an unequal division of the family home. The value of the home was $360,000. The court used the date of application to determine the amount owing on the home. The petitioner also had rental properties and was given an exemption of $90,641.43 for those properties. After taking into consideration all of the property and exemptions, the respondent failed to prove that he was entitled to any distribution under The Family Property Act. The petitioner did not claim an equalization payment. Costs were awarded to the petitioner and the respondent was restricted from bringing a further court application until those costs were paid.","HELD: The Court ordered interim shared custody with the parties to allow them to deal with service issues. The Court found that the parties had not spoken since December 2012 when the petitioner filed an Answer and Counter-Petition contesting the respondent's claims for sole custody, specified and supervised parenting time, the request for restraining order and costs. The respondent counter-petitioned claiming division of property under The Children’s Law Act, 1997, C-8.2 [Act], joint custody of Z. with primary residence and access for Ms. J. and Mr. S. to receive parenting time. The parties had been locked out for six months.","I will now go through the factors set out in s. 8 of the Act. I find that despite what Mr. S. states, she was the primary parent of Z. since birth and continues to be so. Indeed I learned more (although not much) from his mother’s evidence as to the day-to-day activities. I am left with a degree of uncertainty. I accept that the child expresses these words. The child is in need of a stable, reassuring and positive home. I find that it is best provided in the mother’s home. I am concerned that Z.’s emotional needs have been adversely affected by the conduct of Mr. S. A lessening of Mr. S.’s time with Z. may ameliorate this. [145] Accordingly I am persuaded that Z. is afforded far more social fulfillment when in his mother’s care. I find that this adversely reflects upon Mr. S.’s ability to parent. [165] Therefore after carefully considering all of the above, I am of the view the following orders are in the child’s best interests, and I so order: (a) The petitioner, M.D.J., shall have sole custody of the child Z., born in June 2010, with his primary residence to be with the said petitioner. (b) The respondent, C.W.S., shall have alternate weekend access with the said child from Friday at 6:00 p.m. to Sunday at 6:00 p.m. to be extended to Monday at 6:00 p.m. in the event Monday is a school holiday. Therefore I accept the respondent’s argument and will add back into her income $5,000, which I consider to be fair. [170] I am satisfied that Z.’s s. 7 expenses for health, dental, activities and pre-school are about $5,061.35 per year (see P-28, tab 19 in P-8).

The interim agreement provided that the parties would have Z. in the interim care of the mother and that the respondent would receive parenting time. The mother was to have her own home. The father was to pay child support and the parties had been locked out. HELD: 1)The mother was concerned that the father was holding her child from her and that she needed to end the relationship. She telephoned the respondent the next morning principally to try and get the child back to her house. 2)The father was in constant pain and the mother was afraid to get out of his house. 3)All communication went through their lawyers. 4)The parties had followed the interim agreement which provided that all materials would be provided to the petitioner. 5)The evidence from the parties’ lawyers was that although the father had not seen the child for some time, he was often verbally abusive, grabbing the petitioner and hugging her and saying things like “I’m sorry” and “Get out of here!” The petitioner’s counsel had accurately summarized the verbalizations in the statement of mind given by the father that the child would not be able to sleep with her for several days because of the restrictions placed on his access to the computer and the Internet. 6)The petitioner was awarded one-half of the day and one-third of the parenting time that was to be paid for by the respondent. 7)The respondent was ordered to pay $600 in child support, the cost of the settlement and the costs of the application. 8)The wife was to bring the child to her home in Warman and the respondent was to provide the other half of the household with necessities such as books, toys and books. 9)The child was to spend one day with his mother in her home. 10)The parents would have access on a shared week-on/week basis until trial could be held",0.23397761953204477

[61] The Plaintiff’s action will be dismissed.",0.15037593984962405,"The plaintiff bus driver was in a serious bus/motor vehicle accident that killed two people. He was charged with dangerous driving. His employer offered the services of its lawyer, who eventually transferred the file to the defendant who represented him at trial. At trial, the Crown introduced a video of a purported accident re-enactment. The defendant chose not to object to its admission, saying he felt it was a perfect example of the Crown's 'doomed to failure' theory. As for the problems (it was recorded in the daytime, while the accident happened at daybreak; it assumed the vehicle that was struck was stopped, although there was no proof it was; and it didn't show all of the vehicles at the original scene), he felt these could be addressed by cross-examination. The plaintiff was convicted. He retained a different lawyer to represent him on appeal, and won. Eventually, the charges were dropped. The lawyer's competence was not raised as an issue on appeal. In their decision, the Court of Appeal criticized him for not objecting to the admission of the video and other evidence. They found this evidence was inadmissible, highly prejudicial and should never have been put to the jury. The plaintiff sued in negligence and breach of contract. The parties introduced conflicting opinions from criminal law experts to support their respective positions. Action dismissed. The standard of care is that of a reasonably competent lawyer. Lawyers make strategic decisions and exercise judgment, but are not responsible to ensure a certain result. Sometimes the decisions are wrong: it is only negligence if it was outside the realm of acceptable possibilities in the circumstances of the case. The appeal panel had the benefit of hindsight - it is improper to judge the plaintiff's actions in light of their conclusions. While the experts were not helpful in establishing what a reasonably competent lawyer (as opposed to a specialist in the field) would do, their differing opinions illustrate how the admissibility of evidence can be the subject of much debate.","The plaintiff's employer suspended him from work without pay following the laying of criminal charges. They offered, however at their expense, the use of their legal counsel to defend the plaintiff. The plaintiff objected to the admission of the video re-enactment and its still photographs, as well as the opinions given by the RCMP Traffic Analyst regarding the amount of time that someone would have had to see the Chrysler and stop their vehicle. At trial, the plaintiff argued that the Crown's theory of the accident was fatally flawed and that its evidence should not have been introduced by the Crown, nor should counsel have referred to the theory in summation.

The statement of claim contains the following information: 1) the plaintiff was last employed by SaskTel in a temporary position (term) that lasted from April 2, 1990 to November 30, 1990; 2) the defendant states that it appears that the plaintiff's Claim may allege that he was injured at work during his time at Sasktel, while the defendant does not admit this fact, if the Claim is allegedly based on such injury, then the Defendant pleads the Workers' Compensation Act, 2013 R.S.S.; and 3) The claim apparently is about events from 1990 and therefore any claim is statute barred under the Limitations Act. SaskTel was awarded its costs.

S.R.G. et al, 2006 SCC 37. 2) The respondent has been content to accept $380 per month as fair level of child support for both children. What precipitated the respondent's review in July 2006 was Meghan's departure from his home where she began to live independently with the prospect of attending college. What further propelled the continued action on the respondent's part was the publicity attendant with the Supreme Court of Canada's release of its judgment in July 2006. There is no reasonable excuse as to why the respondent did not seek a variation earlier, other than concluding that the respondent accepted $380 per month as reasonable in the circumstances that prevailed from July 2003 to July 2006. 3) There is no evidence of blameworthy conduct on the petitioner's part. There was no agreement or obligation to disclose tax returns. No written request was made pursuant to s. 25 of the Guidelines.

Nor was there evidence of financial hardship experienced by the children. 5) To order retroactive support of $4,322, whether payable in a lump sum or by installments over time, would represent a hardship to a wage earner in the petitioner's category.

Four years later the accused was arrested in British Columbia and brought to trial. The accused was convicted of three drug offences and two driving offences following a jury trial. He was sentenced to a total of 35 months in prison. The accused appeal both the convictions and the sentence. HELD: The accused argued the convictions were unreasonable and not supported by the evidence. The grounds were: (a) the officer's eye witness identification evidence cannot support a conviction; (b) the trial judge made inappropriate comments about whether the accused could have outrun the officer at the end of the car chase, if he was the driver; (c) an adverse inference should been drawn from the Crown's failure to call the second officer; (d) the trial judge's treatment of the photographs of the accused misled the jury about what had to be proven to establish the accused was driving the Tempo; (e) the jury was improperly lead to place reliance on an assessment of a witness's credibility made by an officer who questioned him about his possible involvement in the grow-op. The Court found: (a) the jury was alerted to the frailties of the officer's identification evidence, and the convictions were not unreasonable in light of the evidence as a whole; (b) it was open to the jury to consider whether the accused could have outrun the officer, and the judge's caution about changes in physical condition over time put the issue into a proper perspective; (c) the judge told the jury that it could draw an adverse inference from the Crown's failure to call the second officer, but the decision lies with the jury and the judge is not obliged to tell the jury that it must draw the inference; (d) when the charge is considered as a whole, the jury was not left with the impression that if it concluded the pictures were of the accused that it somehow followed that he was the driver of the Tempo; (e) the judge's remarks did not improperly influence the jury's assessment of the witness's credibility.

The trial judge warned the jury about the dangers of eye witness identification evidence. She emphasized that an honest and apparently convincing witness can be mistaken on identification issues. 2) The appellant's argument that the trial judge left the jury with an erroneous sense of their significance was misplaced. When the charge is considered as a whole, the court does not believe the jury was in any way left with the impression that, if the photographs were of the appellant, they should also conclude that he was the driver of the Tempo. The appellant argued that, on the whole of the evidence, the verdict reached was one that properly instructed a trier of fact, acting judicially, could reasonably have rendered. It appears that, at the time of the trial, Mr. Holoboff was not in good physical condition. The jury was alerted to them and were advised that the appellant's concerns were rooted in part of the charge where the judge told the jurors they could decide for themselves whether the individual depicted in the photographs was Mr. Horkoff. 3) The Court was not persuaded that the judge's remarks would have unduly or unreasonably influenced the jury's decision to sentence the appellant to consecutive terms.","Disposition: Dismissed (Orally) [1] Following a jury trial, David Horkoff was convicted of three drug offences and two Criminal Code driving offences.

They can be summarized as follows: (a) Constable Badger’s eye witness identification evidence cannot support a conviction, (b) the trial judge made inappropriate comments about whether, if it was Mr. Holoboff driving the Tempo, he could have outrun Constable Badger at the end of the car chase, (c) an adverse inference should have been drawn from the Crown’s failure to call the officer who was in the police car with Constable Badger, (d) the trial judge’s treatment of the photographs of Mr. Horkoff misled the jury about what had to be proven in order to establish that Mr. Horkoff was driving the Tempo, (e) the jury was improperly led to place particular reliance on an assessment of Mr. Holoboff’s credibility made by an R.C.M.P. officer who questioned him about possible involvement in the grow-op. However, the jury was alerted to them and we are unable to conclude that Mr. Horkoff’s convictions were unreasonable in light of the evidence as a whole. It was open to the jury to consider, on a common sense basis, whether it was likely that Mr. Holoboff could have outrun Constable Badger. The trial judge’s caution about changes in physical condition over time adequately put that issue into a proper perspective. Assuming this is in fact a situation when an adverse inference could have been drawn, the trial judge was not obliged to instruct the jury that it must proceed to draw the inference. When the charge is considered as a whole, we do not believe the jury was in any way left with the impression that, if it concluded the photographs were of Mr. Horkoff, it somehow followed that he was the driver of the Tempo. Further, the sentences imposed by the trial judge were not demonstrably unfit. [32] The conviction appeals and the sentence appeals are dismissed.",0.2750809061488673,"Following a jury trial, the appellant was convicted of three drug offences and two Criminal Code driving offences. He was sentenced to 35 months in prison. He appealed his convictions and his sentence arguing that the former were unreasonable and the latter was too severe. HELD: The appeal was dismissed with written reasons.  1) The issues identified by the appellant do not operate to make his convictions unreasonable. The trial judge warned the jury about the dangers of eye witness identification evidence. She emphasized that an honest and apparently convincing witness can be mistaken on identification issues. 2) The appellant's argument that the trial judge left the jury with an erroneous sense of their significance was misplaced. When the charge is considered as a whole, the court does not believe the jury was in any way left with the impression that, if the photographs were of the appellant, they should also conclude that he was the driver of the Tempo. The appellant argued that, on the whole of the evidence, the verdict reached was one that properly instructed a trier of fact, acting judicially, could reasonably have rendered. It appears that, at the time of the trial, Mr. Holoboff was not in good physical condition. The jury was alerted to them and were advised that the appellant's concerns were rooted in part of the charge where the judge told the jurors they could decide for themselves whether the individual depicted in the photographs was Mr. Horkoff. 3) The Court was not persuaded that the judge's remarks would have unduly or unreasonably influenced the jury's decision to sentence the appellant to consecutive terms.",0.275177304964539

On appeal it was held to be entitled to a refund for each of the three years in the total amount of $420,000.

The plaintiff sought interest pursuant to s. 41(i) of the Judicature Act, supra on the refund from the date it made the overpayments in response to HRM's tax invoices requiring payment of those amounts on the ""due dates"" in 1995 and 1996 inclusive. The Nova Scotia Court of Appeal upheld the Utility and Review Board's assessment determination, which translated into the overpayment of taxes. Canada Trust could not bring an action to recover an overpayment from HRM at any time before the disposition of the appeal. The intention can be gained from the very terms or phrases in s41(i)(i) and the Judicator Act, which only apply where there is a proceeding for the recovery of debt or damages and it is a mischaracterization of the various levels of assessment appeals to suggest they are proceedings for recovery of debts or damages. HELD: There was no cause of action for return of any over payment of taxes until after the appeal provisions of the Assessment Act had been exhausted. The date from which interest is calculated in this action to pursue Canada Trust's right to interest on the amount of the over payment is upon completion of the appeals process. Interest could be claimed under s40(i), supra from the time the tax payments were to be paid until disposition.  1)The Judicator's Act does not create debt. The Judicator has no right to refund of overpaid taxes until the end of any appeal of the assessment. It specifically and expressly requires the municipality to refund the amount overpaid and intentionally makes no mention in this or in any other section to paying interest on that overpayment. An appropriate interest claim does exist under s43(i). It does not change or revert back to an earlier date when the assessment payments were remitted because the appeal process has concluded.  2)The date of payment for the refund of tax owing to Canada Trust was the date when it could be said to be a 'overpayment of tax' and the date of the payment of the property tax refund could not be determined until the disposition. 3)Canada Trust was under a direct mandatory statutory obligation, pursuant to ss. 90 and s. 90, supra to refund any amount over paid as soon as the appeal concluded.","The plaintiff, Canada Trustco Mortgage Company, (""Canada Trust""), a municipal tax payer paid its property taxes as assessed for the years 1994, 1995, 1996 but on appeal was held entitled to a refund for each of the three years in the total amount of $420,177.13.

The trial judge concluded that he was bound by s.89(1) of the Indian Act, which holds that the real and personal property of an Indian or a band situated on a reserve is not subject to charge, pledge, mortgage, attachment, levy, seizure, distress or execution in favour of or at the instance of any person other than an Indian or a band. He concluded that the money owed Francis by the Shubenacadie band was the property of an Indian on a reserve, and that assignment of book debts, both general and specific, were included within the meaning of s.89(1). He found that the respondent Eskasoni Band was the only Indian entity among the several claimants and ordered the money paid to them. The appellants appealed. Allowing the appeal on the issue of the Indian Act, that s.89(1) does not prevent an Indian from assigning book debts of his construction business to secure business loans. When Indians are in business they hold and deal with their business property in the commercial mainstream on terms no different than those applicable to all Canadians. Nevertheless, the Eskasoni Band is still entitled to the money owed to Francis by reason of having obtained the first general assignment of book debts from him and having registered it prior to Francis making further assignments. The registration of a general assignment of book debts is constructive notice of the assignment to subsequent assignees falling within the provisions of s.3 of the Assignment of Book Debts Act.","This was an appeal from a decision of the Supreme Court in Mitchell v. Peguis Indian Band which held that s. 89(1) of the Indian Act was applicable and governed the issue he was required to consider. HELD: Appeal allowed. 1)The Act does not expressly or impliedly confer any greater right upon an assignee of a chose in action that he had before. The purpose of the Act is not to remedy the economically disadvantaged position of Indians by ensuring that the innocent purchaser is protected provided he had no notice, whether the agreement complies with the Bills of Sale Act or not. 2)The assignment as such transferred to the plaintiff no rights in the choses in action which were recognised at common law. Its efficacy was based solely upon principles of equity, with the additional statutory right given to the assignee to bring action in his own name, instead of that of the assignor, against the debtor upon giving notice to the creditor. 3)The Court was of the opinion that under the provisions of the Conveyancing and Law of Property Act an agreement which is not evidenced by writing and filed in compliance with section is void even against a party having notice (See Edwards v. Furniture Finance Corp., 1930 CanLII 426). 4)The appeal should be dismissed with costs if only on the simple ground that it was never in the contemplation of the parties to the assignment that the conditional sales agreements covered, as the parties knew, by the previous contract between Fagel and the defendant, should be affected by the subsequent assignment of the book debts.","THE COURT: Appeal allowed per reasons for judgment of Hallett, J.A.; Bateman and Flinn, JJ.A. concurring. This is an appeal from a decision of Mr. Justice Edwards arising out of an interpleader application by the Shubenacadie Band Council to determine which of several parties was entitled to be paid a sum of money owing by the Shubenacadie Band under a construction contract entered into by the Shubenacadie Band with the respondent Paul Kenneth Francis for the construction of residential homes on the Shubenacadie Reserve. Mr. Francis is an Indian, a member of the Eskasoni Band, and resides on the Eskasoni Reserve in Cape Breton. Section 89(1) states:

""89. (1) Subject to this Act, the real and personal property of an Indian or a band situated on a reserve is not subject to charge, pledge, mortgage, attachment, levy, seizure, distress or execution in favour or at the instance of any person other than an Indian or a band."" The learned trial judge concluded that the sum of $101,636.33 owing by the Shubenacadie Band to Mr. Francis and held at the Council office in the form of a bank draft payable to the Band in trust was the property of an Indian on a reserve. He further held, applying a liberal interpretation of the Indian Act that assignments of book debts, both general and specific, were included within the wording of s. 89(1) of the Act. On the appeal L. Martin (1984) Inc. asserts that Justice Edwards misinterpreted s. 89(1) of the Act and that it is entitled to $70,000 of this fund by reason of a letter of direction from Francis to his solicitor instructing his solicitor to pay to Martin funds which were due to Mr. Francis from the Shubenacadie Band to the maximum amount of $70,000. I am, however, of the opinion that the Eskasoni Band is entitled to the fund by reason of having obtained the first general assignment of book debts from Francis and having registered it prior to Francis making further assignments notwithstanding that the holders of the subsequent assignments or directions to pay (which the parties agreed were assignments in the Agreed Statement of Facts) gave notice of the assignments they held to the debtor, the Shubenacadie Band, prior to the Eskasoni Band giving notice to the Shubenacadie Band of its prior registered general assignment of book debts.

The vehicle had collided with a power pole and sustained significant damage. The engine was running when the police arrived. There was no one else in the vehicle. The accused was transported to hospital where the doctor suspected he had a brain bleed and recommended the police obtain a blood warrant. The officer who swore the Information to Obtain the warrant indicated that the interior of the vehicle smelled strongly of beverage alcohol and the accused smelled of beverage alcohol. The Justice of the Peace did not sign the Information to Obtain. The issues before the Court were whether there had been a breach of the accused's s. 8 right to be free from unreasonable search and seizure and whether the Crown had proven beyond a reasonable doubt that the accused was in care and control of the motor vehicle. HELD: The blood warrant was found to be invalid, meaning that the blood samples were obtained as part of a warrantless search in breach of s. 8. The Information to Obtain the blood warrant did not depose that the officer believed the accused was the driver of the vehicle which had crashed into the power pole or that the accused was in care and control of the motor vehicle.

The judge determined that since the respondent had paid the lump sum, his obligations were terminated; therefore, the Family Court did not have jurisdiction to hear the application. Allowing the appeal and returning the matter to the Family Court, that orders for child support made under the Family Maintenance Act do not have the finality which they did under other previous legislation. The order is always subject to variation in appropriate circumstances. Accordingly, the Family Court has jurisdiction to vary awards of lump sum child support made pursuant to the Family Maintenance Act.","This was an appeal from the decision of the Family Court concerning a lump sum payment made under the Children of Unmarried Parents Act. At issue was whether an order for payment of maintenance or expenses or respecting care and custody or access and visiting privileges has been varied after payment. The issue before the court was whether such an order could be varied. HELD: The appeal was allowed. 1)Since the merger of the two courts, the designation of Supreme Court should be substituted for the reference in the statute to the County Court. The general principles favouring the claim must yield to the clear, specific intention of the statute and the order made under it. The case Gillis v. Soulis was not determinative of the issue as it did not deal with the issue of whether lump sum payments can be varied under the Family Maintenance Act. There is no power in the courts of Nova Scotia to vary such orders. They are unique creations of a particular statute, and the statute must govern. It is possible to arrive at this conclusion merely by considering the scheme of the Children's Unmarried Parent Act. However any lingering doubt is removed by s34, which states with finality that 'this Part', the part dealing with the father's civil liability to pay maintenance, is the successor legislation, 'this part shall not apply to any punitive father who has fulfilled the terms of any order made against him with respect to the same child under Part 1'."" 2)The court was unable to cite a case other than Ivey v. Muir in which lump sum orders under the old Children's unmarried parents Act have ever been varied before payment.","Judge Levy held a pre‑trial conference, at which time the respondent raised a jurisdictional question, arguing that the payment of the lump sum in 1985 fully and finally discharged his responsibility for child support.

An assessment of $195,785.90 was made against the respondent because the vessel was registered in Nova Scotia and had been used in the province.

The appeal should be accepted. Accordingly, I am of the view that the Board did act outside its jurisdiction in denying dependant benefits to the applicant based upon a determination that the applicant’s deceased spouse was not found dead within the meaning of s. 30 of the Act.

They had three children, the youngest being born five days before a previous application. At the initial application the respondent mother was living in the family home and the petitioner was living at the family cottage and expected to move into the new home when it was ready. The petitioner did move into the home, which was a few blocks from the family home. The youngest child was almost a year old and the petitioner was having increased parenting time with him. The parties agreed to have a custody and access report prepared. The issues were: 1) divorce; 2) registration of the middle child in Montessori school. The respondent opposed the child attending the school because he was not yet potty trained. The petitioner advised that the school was okay with the child not being potty trained; 3) to take the child to a speech therapist. The parties ended up resolving the issue before chambers; 4) varying the existing parenting arrangements.  There was an interim order from January 2015 made shortly after the third child was born. The respondent had since hired a full-time nanny. The respondent did not necessarily oppose the petitioner spending more time with the youngest child, but she wanted to be the one to control the developing of that time. The petitioner wanted the child Wednesday afternoon to evening and Sunday from 11:00 am to 4:00 pm. He also wanted increased time with the two older children so that he could get them to their necessary activities and so that they could continue to develop their bond with him; 5) arrears of child and spousal support; 6) the respondent’s request to return the 2005 vehicle. The vehicle had been at the parties’ farm and was damaged beyond repair without insurance. The petitioner then towed the vehicle to the respondent’s home; 7) objections to one of the petitioner’s affidavits; and 8) costs. HELD: The issues were decided as follows: 1) the divorce was granted because the parties had been separated in excess of a year and no satisfactory reasons were argued for not allowing it; 2) the court held that it would be appropriate for the child to be enrolled in the Montessori school. The cost of the program was ordered to be paid by the petitioner. The parties were to agree on the child’s transportation to the school and if they could not agree the petitioner would transport him; 3) the court kept the issue under its jurisdiction so that either party could bring the matter back upon two days’ notice; 4) the pre-trial conference was months away and the court did not find it appropriate to have the matter of increased parenting time proceed to a pre-trial conference, as a stand-alone issue. The court found that it was in the best interests of all the children to have further time with the petitioner as he requested. The court also dealt with transportation for the hockey and the middle child’s skating; 5) counsel agreed that the issue of arrears due under the support provisions would await further discussion at the pre-trial conference with either party having leave to bring the matter back on two days’ notice; 6) the matter was adjourned sine die on two days’ notice; 7) the complaints were not generally well-founded; and 8) the petitioner was entitled to costs of $1,000 in any event of the cause.

Accordingly, the judgment for divorce is granted. 2. To register the child, Jude Babich, in a Montessori School – brought by the petitioner. On the basis of the evidence before me, it is therefore appropriate Jude now be enrolled in the Montessori program.

The petitioner seeks to have his parenting time set rather than at the whim of the respondent. 5. To set the arrears of child and spousal support – brought by the respondent. [63] As a result of this agreement, the issue of arrears of support and enforcement of any arrears from the date of the order to today’s date is to await the conclusion of the pre-trial conference.

The parties were one year removed from the original decision and the matter would not get to pre-trial. There was no reason for the denial of the divorce at this stage. The child was now fully potty trained and would be able to participate in the program. The issues were resolved prior to the matter coming to chambers. The mere passage of time is not sufficient reason to vary an existing order. The statutory requirements pursuant to the Divorce Act for the granting of a divorce are present. The matter will therefore proceed to trial. The court has not dealt with the issue of the petitioner's participation in wrestling.

Arrangements to express breast milk while the child is being breastfed were made in order that the petitioner could be in contact with the baby while in his care. In addition, the petitioner was ordered to have additional parenting time with the two older children (ages 5 and 6). The petitioner sought to have the oldest child (now one year old) enrolled in a private program with an emphasis on social interaction and the development of the child. The second child (aged 1) was also included. The petitioner was granted custody and access on two of the three parenting issues. The third child (ages 1 and 5) was already enrolled in the private program. An application to vary the existing parenting arrangements was made in light of the state of the family property.","The parts of the various applications are as follows:

They had three children, the youngest being born five days before a previous application. At the initial application the respondent mother was living in the family home and the petitioner was living at the family cottage and expected to move into the new home when it was ready. The petitioner did move into the home, which was a few blocks from the family home. The youngest child was almost a year old and the petitioner was having increased parenting time with him. The parties agreed to have a custody and access report prepared. The issues were: 1) divorce; 2) registration of the middle child in Montessori school. The respondent opposed the child attending the school because he was not yet potty trained. The petitioner advised that the school was okay with the child not being potty trained; 3) to take the child to a speech therapist. The parties ended up resolving the issue before chambers; 4) varying the existing parenting arrangements.  There was an interim order from January 2015 made shortly after the third child was born. The respondent had since hired a full-time nanny. The respondent did not necessarily oppose the petitioner spending more time with the youngest child, but she wanted to be the one to control the developing of that time. The petitioner wanted the child Wednesday afternoon to evening and Sunday from 11:00 am to 4:00 pm. He also wanted increased time with the two older children so that he could get them to their necessary activities and so that they could continue to develop their bond with him; 5) arrears of child and spousal support; 6) the respondent’s request to return the 2005 vehicle. The vehicle had been at the parties’ farm and was damaged beyond repair without insurance. The petitioner then towed the vehicle to the respondent’s home; 7) objections to one of the petitioner’s affidavits; and 8) costs. HELD: The issues were decided as follows: 1) the divorce was granted because the parties had been separated in excess of a year and no satisfactory reasons were argued for not allowing it; 2) the court held that it would be appropriate for the child to be enrolled in the Montessori school. The cost of the program was ordered to be paid by the petitioner. The parties were to agree on the child’s transportation to the school and if they could not agree the petitioner would transport him; 3) the court kept the issue under its jurisdiction so that either party could bring the matter back upon two days’ notice; 4) the pre-trial conference was months away and the court did not find it appropriate to have the matter of increased parenting time proceed to a pre-trial conference, as a stand-alone issue. The court found that it was in the best interests of all the children to have further time with the petitioner as he requested. The court also dealt with transportation for the hockey and the middle child’s skating; 5) counsel agreed that the issue of arrears due under the support provisions would await further discussion at the pre-trial conference with either party having leave to bring the matter back on two days’ notice; 6) the matter was adjourned sine die on two days’ notice; 7) the complaints were not generally well-founded; and 8) the petitioner was entitled to costs of $1,000 in any event of the cause. The respondent was entitled to costs of $200 in any event of the cause. The court declined to send the matter to the high-conflict mediation program.","HELD: The court granted the judgment and ordered the child to be registered in the Montessori program by the petitioner. The parties were one year removed from the original decision and the matter would not get to pre-trial. There was no reason for the denial of the divorce at this stage. The child was now fully potty trained and would be able to participate in the program. The issues were resolved prior to the matter coming to chambers. The mere passage of time is not sufficient reason to vary an existing order. The statutory requirements pursuant to the Divorce Act for the granting of a divorce are present. The matter will therefore proceed to trial. The court has not dealt with the issue of the petitioner's participation in wrestling. This child is now 5 days old and the other children are still infants. The respondent indicated she would be the primary parent with the children. Arrangements to express breast milk while the child is being breastfed were made in order that the petitioner could be in contact with the baby while in his care. In addition, the petitioner was ordered to have additional parenting time with the two older children (ages 5 and 6). The petitioner sought to have the oldest child (now one year old) enrolled in a private program with an emphasis on social interaction and the development of the child. The second child (aged 1) was also included. The petitioner was granted custody and access on two of the three parenting issues. The third child (ages 1 and 5) was already enrolled in the private program. An application to vary the existing parenting arrangements was made in light of the state of the family property.","The parts of the various applications are as follows:

[117] The amount of 15 years suggested in the spousal support agreement far exceeds what one would consider might be imposed by a court of law given the years they were together and their income disparity. I am prepared to order while the child remains in Moncton an additional $300 spousal support for a month for a limited term to address the access costs in the mother’s budget that are associated with access.,0.1509433962264151,"The wife sought to have the terms of the parties' separation agreement incorporated into the corollary relief judgment following a four year marriage. The husband sought to vary the provisions of the agreement regarding spousal and child support on the basis that the particulars of the agreement did not reflect his net business income derived from self-employment. The husband argued that he had entered into the separation agreement (which provided for joint custody of their young child, gave the wife all of the matrimonial assets with the exception of the husband's vehicle, and provided for spousal support in the amount of $600 per month for 15 years) only as an attempt to have the wife stay in the local area with the child. The wife had since moved with the child to New Brunswick where she was living with her parents and attending university; she was renting out the matrimonial home. Pursuant to the current court order, she was contributing the sum of $140 per month to the husband's access costs. Husband's current income set and child support awarded; the husband shall be responsible for 50 percent of the after tax child care costs; an additional $300 of spousal support ordered per month while the child remains in New Brunswick to address the access costs in the mother's budget; spousal support is reviewable in the event that these circumstances change, and at any rate, upon the completion of the mother's current degree; the mother shall not remove the child from the Province of New Brunswick to live in any other province without the father's consent. Although the court could not interfere with the agreement under s. 29 of the Matrimonial Property Act, the spousal and child support geared at keeping the wife in the local area and ensuring that her needs were addressed had all changed and a new arrangement was necessary to reflect the access costs among other issues. The wife had chosen to move away from child care services provided by the family that were practically free, as well as significant financial support and the ability to work in the furniture business with her father-in-law; she was not now pursuing a line of education which would build on her previous skills. Her educational expenses ought not be the basis for assessing spousal support and the duration of support set out in the separation agreement far exceeded what might be imposed by a court given the years they were together and their income disparity. The court reviewed the husband's history of income and expenses in setting his income for child support purposes.","The wife commenced divorce proceedings in November 2004.She sought custody, access, child support, spousal support and costs with a division of property in accordance with the Separation Agreement entered into between herself and the father. The father sought a variation of the provisions regarding child support and child support. It was his position that the particulars of the agreement did not and do not now reflect his net business income derived from self employment.HELD: 1) The separation agreement clearly favours the mother. All jurisdictional elements have been proven. There is no possibility of reconciliation between the parties. 2) The parties agreed in the interim that their child would not be removed from his home and that their agreement of joint custody would not affect his mobility. 3) The father agreed to pay child support in an amount that was not justified by his actual income or the circumstances of the parties lives. It is clearly unequal favouring the wife. There was no evidence to suggest it was unconscionable. 4) The mother was to have sufficient income to run her business. The parties had the opportunity to consult with independent counsel. 5) The respondent was to assume all his business expenses including business tax, fees, insurance, 100% of his motor vehicle expenses and travel. The respondent had no reason to exclude any of his personal expenses from his allowance. 6) The petitioner had the benefit of a matrimonial home which she planned to rent in the coming year. She was to receive a capital cost deduction of $10,625 for an annual income of $22,878. 7) The court reviewed the net earnings, purchasing and net profits of the respondent and the paternal grandparents. The court found that the respondent had a conscientious choice in that he did not seek to limit his access to the home and was prepared to give his equity in the home to assure that his child would remain in the area. The paternal grandparents had similar interests in keeping the petitioner and her child in the jurisdiction. Thus the agreement as see it was signed had become an issue that requires review.

[39] However, regardless of that alcohol consumption, and the accused’s blood alcohol concentration, the only reliable indicia of impairment were a very strong odour of alcohol and a flushed face. Beyond that, the indicators are either inconclusive, non-existent or the accused has offered a reasonable explanation for them. As a result, the evidence is so frail as to leave a reasonable doubt as to impairment, and the accused must be acquitted.",0.4819734345351044,"The accused was charged that on April 27, 2002, he did operate a motor vehicle while his ability to do so was impaired by alcohol or a drug, contrary to s. 253(a) of the Criminal Code. The issue was whether the evidence was sufficient to prove impairment beyond a reasonable doubt. HELD: The accused was acquitted of all charges.  1)On the evidence, the accused did not show any signs of impairment. His blood alcohol concentration was at least 140 milligrams percent. 2)The only reliable indicia of impairment were a very strong smell of alcohol and a flushed face. 3)The Court concluded that in the absence of expert evidence to explain the scientific basis for these tests, the proper method of application and to comment on their reliability, it was not appropriate for the court to rely upon them on the issue of guilt or innocence to the prejudice of the accused.  4)The accused's blood alcohol content was at or near.08. The Court gave careful consideration to the evidence of the alleged erratic driving and the accused's explanation for it. The accused's response in stopping was delayed and he braked abruptly. The opportunity to make the observations was only during 2 minutes. 5)There was nothing unusual about the accused driving on a divided highway in light traffic. He was exceeding the speed limit and had failed to signal lane changes, which he made in an abrupt manner as he passed the only other vehicle in the immediate vicinity. He appeared to fully comprehend his rights and obligations in his communications with the peace officer and legal aid duty counsel. He did not display any mental confusion or noteworthy inappropriate behaviour. He conducted himself in a rational and reasonable manner.",0.3480916030534351

7_2012skqb510.txt,"The defendant was charged with unlawfully harvesting forest products contrary to s. 79(1)(a) of The Forest Resources Management Act, unlawfully possessing forest products without a licence contrary to s. 79(1)(c) and unlawfully trafficking in forest products contrary to s. 79(1)(f) of the Act. He was acquitted of the first two charges and convicted of the third. He appealed his conviction. He was fined $1,000 with a 40% surcharge. The Crown appealed the sentence. The appellant argued that since he was acquitted of the related charges, it followed that he should not have been convicted of trafficking. The charges had arisen as a result of a lengthy undercover investigation into the activities of the appellant. He was known to be harvesting fire kill in the Nesbitt Forest, which was Crown land. He stored wood on his property and on that of a relative. If the appellant was using it himself, he did not require a permit. The undercover conservation officer purchased fire wood from the appellant, who told the officer that the wood was from Crown land in an answer to officer's question whether it was cut on private land. The appellant did not testify at his trial nor did his relative and so the evidence of the conservation officer was uncontradicted. The evidence presented on his behalf was from individuals who had purchased wood from the defendant. The trial judge held that the charges against the appellant were strict liability offences and once the Crown had demonstrated beyond a reasonable doubt that the prohibited acts had been committed, the appellant had to establish on the balance of probabilities that he had been duly diligent and took all reasonable care to avoid offending. With respect to the first two charges, the trial judge held that he was not satisfied that during the period described in the indictment that the Crown had proven the actus reus of the offences but that it had on the third count, based on the appellant's own words to the officer. The appellant argued on appeal that his words could have been taken to mean that he was describing where he harvested wood for his own use and therefore his statement was not an admission that he sold wood to the officer or anyone else from Crown lands. HELD: The Court held that the trial judge erred in his reasoning and conclusion that appellant was guilty of trafficking because he had not been duly diligent. It is only if the actus reus was proven beyond a reasonable doubt that the considerations of whether due diligence had been proven would arise. The conviction could not be maintained because the qualifying actus reus was not proven. However, the other aspect of the evidence, which was not expressly considered by the trial judge and which would sustain a conviction, was if evidence established trafficking via another modality. Since s. 2(dd) of the Act defines 'traffic' to mean 'to offer for sale, barter, deal, solicit or tradeÃ ' and s. 79(1) states that it is an offence to traffic in forest products from Crown land without a licence, then the offence is complete by offering the product for sale without a licence. The appellant led no evidence to establish he had either the required permit to harvest forest products from Crown lands or a licence or any other form of authorization to deal in forest products. Thus, the evidence established beyond a reasonable doubt that the appellant was guilty of trafficking in forest products contrary to s. 79(1)(f) of the Act. The conviction was upheld. Regarding sentencing, the Court held that it was important to deter other offenders. The trial judge's sentence of a fine equivalent to the levy avoided (the provincial charge per cord of wood) was inappropriately low. The Court set the appropriate fine at $5,000 plus a victim fund surcharge of 40% as required by s. 3 of The Victims of Crime Regulations. If the fine was not paid within 60 days, the appellant would serve a term of imprisonment of 90 days.","HELD: The appeal was allowed and the sentence imposed was quashed. The court found that the defendant had not proven beyond a reasonable doubt that the firewood he sold to an undercover officer was wood harvested from Crown lands. It also found that a fine of $1,000 with a 40% surcharge was an unreasonably low penalty for the offence the evidence established.","[1] This case involves an appeal by the defendant from his conviction and by the Crown as regards the sentence imposed on Wayne Gitzel on a charge of unlawfully trafficking in forest products contrary to s. 79(1)(f) of The Forest Resources Management Act, S.S. 1996, c. F-19.1. [3] For its part, the Crown has appealed the sentence imposed taking the position that a fine of $1,000 with a 40% surcharge was an unreasonably low penalty for the offence the evidence established. [4] The charges against Wayne Gitzel are that between November 27, 2007 and December 22, 2009, at or near the communities of Holbein and Shellbrook in the Province of Saskatchewan he:

i) unlawfully harvested forest products contrary to s. 79(1)(a) of The Forest Resources Management Act;
ii) unlawfully possessed forest products without a licence contrary to s. 79(1)(c) of The Forest Resources Management Act; and
iii) unlawfully trafficked in forest products contrary to s. 79(1)(f) of The Forest Resources Management Act. [16] The trial judge held that, after considering all of the evidence, he was not satisfied that during the period in the indictment, the Crown had proven beyond a reasonable doubt the actus reus on Count No. 1 of unlawfully harvesting forest products, nor Count No. 2 of unlawfully possessing forest products without a licence. He found that the Crown had proven, beyond a reasonable doubt, the actus reus on Count No. 3 of unlawfully trafficking in forest products, but he held that given the defendant’s own words to the undercover operator, he was not satisfied, on the balance of probabilities, the defendant was duly diligent to ensure that the wood he sold to the undercover operator and the previous sales (presumably referring to the previous 150 truckloads and the 58 truckloads he told Clarke he sold in 2008 and 2009) was wood coming from private lands. With all due respect to the learned trial judge, I find this conclusion and reasoning to be in error. The defendant led no evidence to establish he had either the required permit to harvest forest products from Crown lands or a licence or any form of authorization to deal in forest products. Thus, the evidence establishes beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant was guilty of trafficking in forest products contrary to s. 79(1)(f) of the Act as charged. Therefore, the conviction stands. Accordingly, a fine equivalent to a levy avoided would be inappropriately low since the fine could not in those circumstances act as a deterrent to either the defendant or other offenders. [41] Factoring in that the defendant was in the offence he committed intending to avoid a charge or levy of $1,500, recognizing the deal that he was making did not conclude and thus he did not actually generate revenue from the proposed transaction and considering the need for a significant deterrent to the defendant and other offenders who are committing this offence on a commercial scale, I have concluded that in the circumstances of this case an appropriate fine is $5,000. Accordingly, the defendant shall pay a fine of $5,000. The defendant shall also pay a victim fund surcharge of 40% as required by s. 3 of The Victims of Crime Regulations, 1997, R.R.S. c. V-6.011 Reg. 1. The defendant shall have 60 days to pay the fine and victim surcharge imposed, and in default of payment shall serve a term of imprisonment of 90 days.",0.1162079510703364,"The defendant was charged with unlawfully harvesting forest products contrary to s. 79(1)(a) of The Forest Resources Management Act, unlawfully possessing forest products without a licence contrary to s. 79(1)(c) and unlawfully trafficking in forest products contrary to s. 79(1)(f) of the Act.

Thus, the evidence established beyond a reasonable doubt that the appellant was guilty of trafficking in forest products contrary to s. 79(1)(f) of the Act. The conviction was upheld. Regarding sentencing, the Court held that it was important to deter other offenders. The trial judge's sentence of a fine equivalent to the levy avoided (the provincial charge per cord of wood) was inappropriately low. The Court set the appropriate fine at $5,000 plus a victim fund surcharge of 40% as required by s. 3 of The Victims of Crime Regulations. If the fine was not paid within 60 days, the appellant would serve a term of imprisonment of 90 days.","HELD: The court upheld the sentence of $1,000 with a 40% surcharge for the offence of unlawfully harvesting forest products and found that it should have quashed the sentence. The conviction was upheld on the basis that there was no evidence that could support a finding that the firewood he sold to an undercover officer was wood harvested from Crown lands. The court found that the Crown had proven beyond a reasonable doubt that the illegal sale of the wood was not the subject matter of this appeal. On appeal, the court could not substitute its view of the evidence for that of the trial judge. On the factual grounds, the standard of review is whether there is evidence upon which a trier of fact, properly instructed, could reasonably reach the verdict. The defendant was found not guilty on the trafficking charge because the evidence of the conservation officers was uncontradicted. The appeal court may allow a Crown appeal where, although not properly convicted on an offence, the defendant was convicted of unlawfully trafficking in forest products contrary to s. 79(1)(f) of The Forest Resources Management Act, but only for the purpose of determining if the evidence was reasonably capable of supporting the learned trial judge's conclusion.","[1] This case involves an appeal by the defendant from his conviction and by the Crown as regards the sentence imposed on Wayne Gitzel on a charge of unlawfully trafficking in forest products contrary to s. 79(1)(f) of The Forest Resources Management Act, S.S. 1996, c. F-19.1. [3] For its part, the Crown has appealed the sentence imposed taking the position that a fine of $1,000 with a 40% surcharge was an unreasonably low penalty for the offence the evidence established. [4] The charges against Wayne Gitzel are that between November 27, 2007 and December 22, 2009, at or near the communities of Holbein and Shellbrook in the Province of Saskatchewan he:

i) unlawfully harvested forest products contrary to s. 79(1)(a) of The Forest Resources Management Act;
ii) unlawfully possessed forest products without a licence contrary to s. 79(1)(c) of The Forest Resources Management Act; and
iii) unlawfully trafficked in forest products contrary to s. 79(1)(f) of The Forest Resources Management Act. [16] The trial judge held that, after considering all of the evidence, he was not satisfied that during the period in the indictment, the Crown had proven beyond a reasonable doubt the actus reus on Count No. 1 of unlawfully harvesting forest products, nor Count No. 2 of unlawfully possessing forest products without a licence. He found that the Crown had proven, beyond a reasonable doubt, the actus reus on Count No. 3 of unlawfully trafficking in forest products, but he held that given the defendant’s own words to the undercover operator, he was not satisfied, on the balance of probabilities, the defendant was duly diligent to ensure that the wood he sold to the undercover operator and the previous sales (presumably referring to the previous 150 truckloads and the 58 truckloads he told Clarke he sold in 2008 and 2009) was wood coming from private lands. With all due respect to the learned trial judge, I find this conclusion and reasoning to be in error. The defendant led no evidence to establish he had either the required permit to harvest forest products from Crown lands or a licence or any form of authorization to deal in forest products. Thus, the evidence establishes beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant was guilty of trafficking in forest products contrary to s. 79(1)(f) of the Act as charged. Therefore, the conviction stands. Accordingly, a fine equivalent to a levy avoided would be inappropriately low since the fine could not in those circumstances act as a deterrent to either the defendant or other offenders. [41] Factoring in that the defendant was in the offence he committed intending to avoid a charge or levy of $1,500, recognizing the deal that he was making did not conclude and thus he did not actually generate revenue from the proposed transaction and considering the need for a significant deterrent to the defendant and other offenders who are committing this offence on a commercial scale, I have concluded that in the circumstances of this case an appropriate fine is $5,000. Accordingly, the defendant shall pay a fine of $5,000. The defendant shall also pay a victim fund surcharge of 40% as required by s. 3 of The Victims of Crime Regulations, 1997, R.R.S. c. V-6.011 Reg. 1. The defendant shall have 60 days to pay the fine and victim surcharge imposed, and in default of payment shall serve a term of imprisonment of 90 days.",0.20698254364089777,"The defendant was charged with unlawfully harvesting forest products contrary to s. 79(1)(a) of The Forest Resources Management Act, unlawfully possessing forest products without a licence contrary to s. 79(1)(c) and unlawfully trafficking in forest products contrary to s. 79(1)(f) of the Act. He was acquitted of the first two charges and convicted of the third. He appealed his conviction. He was fined $1,000 with a 40% surcharge. The Crown appealed the sentence. The appellant argued that since he was acquitted of the related charges, it followed that he should not have been convicted of trafficking. The charges had arisen as a result of a lengthy undercover investigation into the activities of the appellant. He was known to be harvesting fire kill in the Nesbitt Forest, which was Crown land. He stored wood on his property and on that of a relative. If the appellant was using it himself, he did not require a permit. The undercover conservation officer purchased fire wood from the appellant, who told the officer that the wood was from Crown land in an answer to officer's question whether it was cut on private land. The appellant did not testify at his trial nor did his relative and so the evidence of the conservation officer was uncontradicted. The evidence presented on his behalf was from individuals who had purchased wood from the defendant. The trial judge held that the charges against the appellant were strict liability offences and once the Crown had demonstrated beyond a reasonable doubt that the prohibited acts had been committed, the appellant had to establish on the balance of probabilities that he had been duly diligent and took all reasonable care to avoid offending. With respect to the first two charges, the trial judge held that he was not satisfied that during the period described in the indictment that the Crown had proven the actus reus of the offences but that it had on the third count, based on the appellant's own words to the officer. The appellant argued on appeal that his words could have been taken to mean that he was describing where he harvested wood for his own use and therefore his statement was not an admission that he sold wood to the officer or anyone else from Crown lands. HELD: The Court held that the trial judge erred in his reasoning and conclusion that appellant was guilty of trafficking because he had not been duly diligent. It is only if the actus reus was proven beyond a reasonable doubt that the considerations of whether due diligence had been proven would arise. The conviction could not be maintained because the qualifying actus reus was not proven. However, the other aspect of the evidence, which was not expressly considered by the trial judge and which would sustain a conviction, was if evidence established trafficking via another modality. Since s. 2(dd) of the Act defines 'traffic' to mean 'to offer for sale, barter, deal, solicit or tradeÃ ' and s. 79(1) states that it is an offence to traffic in forest products from Crown land without a licence, then the offence is complete by offering the product for sale without a licence.

The court found that a term permitting an appeal from an arbitrator’s decision on an error of law did not fall into the category of the obvious and was not the same as an implied term, such as that of good workmanship in contracts for repair. The contractual language used by the parties was clear that they intended to resolve disputes by final and binding arbitration. Even if it had found that the parties had not contracted out of s. 45(2) of the Act, the application for leave would have been dismissed because the proposed grounds of appeal did not raise a pure issue of law.","HAL applied for leave to appeal the decision of an arbitration panel. The arbitration panel was constituted to resolve a commercial contractual dispute between HAL and SecurTek. The parties entered into three separate contracts designed to accomplish their business goals. They were (i) the International Distribution and Software Licence Agreement [IDSL); (ii) the Software Customization Agreement [ESMA] and (iii) the Escrow and Software Modification Agreement (ESMA). These contracts each provided, among other things, that any disputes which could not be resolved by a binding arbitration panel would be settled by binding arbitration. HELD: The application was dismissed. The provisions of the agreement exclude the right of appeal on questions of law, pursuant to s. 45(2) of the Act. HAL cannot appeal the arbitrators' decision, and the application must be dismissed. 1) The language of the agreements, in particular, is so clear with respect to the arbitration clauses and the finality of the arbitrator's decision, that it cannot be overridden by vagueness or inadvertent omission. The intention expressed in the arbitration clause of the Agreement is clear, and it would take an equally clear statement to convey different intention. 2) The agreements in place by HAL and SURTek do not provide for a right to appeal on a question of law. The agreements set out very clear and well-defined procedures for dispute resolution. It does not permit the application of a term permitting an appeal from an arbitrators’ decision on an error of law simply does not fall into the category of the obvious, or something that goes without saying, in the factual matrix of this case. The scope of appeals permitted by arbitration legislation is narrow, because arbitration is intended to be a complete alternate dispute resolution mechanism, rather than simply an extra layer of litigation. 3) There are some cases in which term must be implied in order to ensure that the intention of the parties is not defeated, the court does not have licence to reconstruct a contract on equitable principles or from the point of view of what the parties should reasonably have contemplated. The question is whether s45(2)(a) permits the application, notwithstanding the absence of such provision in the agreements.

HELD: The accused was found not guilty on both counts. 1)There was insufficient confirmatory evidence for proof of guilt beyond a reasonable doubt. The evidence showed an escalating pattern of intrusive behaviour by the accused who admitted to touching her on two occasions and to have been on top of her once. His explanation that he fell on her was farfetched but the other explanations were not outlandish. None of the complainant's allegations involved alcohol nor was drunkenness alleged to be a factor. The evidence of the complainant's depression or withdrawal could have other explanations.,The accused was charged with offences contrary to s. 271(1) and s. 153 of the Criminal Code. The evidence of the complainant was that the accused touched her numerous times on her vagina and breasts. In all cases the touching was over top of her clothing.

She was convinced beyond a reasonable doubt that he was involved in the acts described in the allegations. 2)There was no evidence to support expert testimony. The complainant was convinced the accused was guilty of all of the offences. 3)The evidence of expert testimony was not supported by the evidence. The following evidence would have confirmed the evidence if it had been supported by expert testimony:,"Although his explanations for touching and his evidence of the complainant’s behaviour are at odds with the Crown’s evidence, there is simply not enough confirmatory evidence surrounding the allegations for there to be proof of guilt beyond a reasonable doubt. Although I am suspicious of his evidence I have compared and contrasted it with that of the Crown’s and, having done so, I am unable to find him guilty beyond a reasonable doubt. 32.

The evidence of the complainant was that the accused often slept on the couch in the basement of the house adjacent to the room where the family watched TV. There was a couch or love seat in the living room adjacent to where the children often stayed up at least until midnight. The accused frequently came up to the complainant and touched her legs, buttocks, breasts and vaginal area. She called the police.

The complainant said that this was because he tripped over her younger sister who was lying on the floor. HELD: The accused was acquitted of all charges. 1)The evidence tends to confirm the complainant's testimony. 2)The accused is not guilty of all of the offences. He is not a person who is prone to paranoid delusions or paranoid delusions. He has explanations for his behaviour. There is no doubt that he is a sexual predator. The only person who would have been more likely to believe him is the accused himself. The circumstantial evidence of paranoid delusions and paranoid delusions is not sufficient to confirm his allegations. He would be wrong to assume that all the evidence surrounding his behaviour and those of his ilk, including the sexual assault allegations, is circumstantially supported by the evidence of other sexual predators. It would not be appropriate for a Court to take judicial notice of his outrageous behaviour and the fact that he was drunk at the time he was charged. Although the accused is from Saskatchewan and raised in the province, his evidence is that he has always lived in a house that is near the residence of his estranged wife.

She worked through most of the marriage, but earned a lot less than the father did. Interim shared parenting, with a review in eight months.

The mother was highly critical of the father's ability to parent, and opposed his application for shared custody. She accused him of abusive behavior, using drugs/abusing alcohol, and claimed he did not help parent when they lived together. The level of conflict between the two was high. Each lived with new partners. They both filed expense statements showing significant monthly deficits but, since they had declared bankruptcy, there was no evidence of how they were meeting the shortfall. The mother sought a share of the father's pension, including his pre-marriage contributions, spousal support and child support. She worked through most of the marriage, but earned a lot less than the father did. Interim shared parenting, with a review in eight months. This is not an ideal arrangement, but the alternatives will leave the children worse off. The father was more credible; the mother's allegations are unsubstantiated. While he's contributed to the conflict in the past, he is making an effort while the mother and her partner are not. The mother will have the final say on health related matters, and the father will have the final say on the choice of childcare and helping with homework (because he is francophone and better able to help). If the mother is unable to learn how to work with the father, the court will consider awarding him custody. On review, the court will consider the parties' ability to communicate and cooperate, including whether or not they are able to agree about extracurricular activities for the children. The father will pay child support in the set-off amount. While he has twice her income, the mother hasn't proven the set-off amount is insufficient to enable her to meet the children's needs while they're with her. It's impossible to have a deficit without disclosing the debt instruments used to support debt accumulation. Her partner is either meeting her shortfall or her expenses are overstated. It would be unfair and unconscionable to award her half of the pre-marriage pension contributions based on the length of the marriage and the fact she wasn't economically dependant on the father. She's not entitled to spousal support. Even if she was, the father has no ability to pay given his obligations to the children.","The parties were married for seven years and had two children, one of which was born of the marriage. The mother was the primary caretaker of the children and her role was to report to the father final decisions about the children's education, health and dental care, and their relationship with the father.

b_1999canlii13927.txt,"The issue was whether it was appropriate for the court to require the accused to commence the trial by calling evidence on a Charter voir dire, where the accused gave notice of a Charter application. This would differ from the usual procedure, wherein the Crown commences the trial by calling its witnesses in the trial proper, and thereafter the accused applies for leave to apply the Crown evidence to the Charter application, where it is appropriate, in addition to calling other defence evidence on the application.HELD: In R. v. Kutynec, the court made the following determinations: 1) whatever procedures are used should not unnecessarily interfere with the inherent jurisdiction of the trial judge to control the conduct of the trial; 2) instead of creating procedures for Charter applications in provincial court, it is better to leave judges the discretion to determine matters such as sufficiency of notice and the extent of the offer of proof; 3) counsel should give timely notice to the Crown of the Charter issue, and at trial, the accused should be able to state with reasonable particularity the grounds upon which the application is made; 4) objections to admissibility of evidence must be made before or when the evidence is proffered; 5) the onus is on the accused to demonstrate on a balance of probabilities that he or she is entitled to a Charter remedy; 6) the trial judge should insist defence counsel state his or her position on possible Charter issues, either before or at the outset of the trial; 7) failing timely notice, a trial judge is entitled to refuse an application to assert a Charter remedy; 8) fairness may require the accused be given some latitude to explore potential Charter issues which he or she had no opportunity to develop prior to trial; and 9) the trial judge must control the proceedings to ensure this legitimate exploration does not become a fishing expedition. In R. v. Loveman, the court said the trial judge must ensure fairness and preserve the integrity of the trial process. This may require a judge to refuse to hear a motion where insufficient notice has been given, even when the motion involves an application to exclude evidence under s. 24 of the Charter. In R. v. Habhab, the court was asked to consider a procedure which involved entering into voir dire at the start of the trial and the Crown proceeding to lead their evidence at the outset regarding the Charter application and substantive issue. The court dismissed this proposal and stated that the case law implies it is the accused's obligation to lead the evidence on the voir dire. The court was not able to justify the proposed procedure. If the authorities imply there is an obligation on the accused to call evidence first on the Charter voir dire, this can occur by the application of some or all the evidence which is already on the record on the substantive issues. The admissibility of evidence can be reserved by the court pending judgment on the Charter and any s. 24 remedy. An advantage of having the Crown evidence on record at the outset is it removes uncertainty as to the nature of the testimony as it relates to the Charter application. This is preferable to the accused calling the Crown witness at the outset on the voir dire, discovering aspects of the evidence are contrary or unfavourable, and then having to convince the court to grant leave to cross-examine. It avoids a scenario where the Crown witness evidence is led by the defence on the voir dire, and then the accused must impeach the creditability of this witness in cross-examination as it relates to the proof of the substantive issues. The court concluded the fairness of the proceedings and public confidence in the administration of justice, were best served by the Crown first leading its evidence on the charge alleged and the accused having leave to request the evidence be applied to the Charter issue, if appropriate.","The issue was whether it was appropriate for the court to require the accused to commence the trial by calling evidence on a Charter voir dire, where the accused has given notice of a Charter application. This would differ from the procedure which is usually utilized, wherein the Crown commences the trial in the trial proper and thereafter the accused applies to the court for leave to apply the Crown evidence to the Charter application, where it is appropriate to do so, and in addition to calling other defence evidence on the application. HELD: The application for exclusion was granted.  1)It was obvious that the accused was not entitled to sit back and hope that something will emerge from the Crown's case to create a Charter argument or assist in one counsel is already prepared to make. It may be that fairness requires the accused be given some latitude at some stage of the trial to explore potential Charter issues which he or she had no opportunity to develop prior to trial. Otherwise, the Crown and the court are entitled to proceed on the basis that no Charter issue is involved in the case.  2)The court reviewed the authorities which were filed by the Crown. The court found that in Provincial Court trials, it is better to leave judges the discretion to determine matters such as sufficiency of notice and the extent of the offer of proof. This is different for trial court which hears cases that have been through preliminary inquiry and detailed pretrial, and that regularly assigns trial judges to cases well before the date of trial. 3)In Provincial Court, it will be for the trial judge to decide what procedure should be followed, but at least, counsel should give timely notice to the Crown of the Charter issue, and at trial, counsel for the accused should be able to state with reasonable particularity the grounds upon which the application for exclude is made. This common sense proposition is equally applicable to Charter applications to exclude evidence. In a situation where an accused is trying to establish that a constitutionally protected right has been breached, the court ought to give counsel more leeway in cross-examination of the defence's own witness than is ordinarily done.","1.

This may require a judge to refuse to hear a motion where insufficient notice has been given, even when the motion involves an application to exclude evidence under s. 24 of the Charter. In R. v. Habhab, the court was asked to consider a procedure which involved entering into voir dire at the start of the trial and the Crown proceeding to lead their evidence at the outset regarding the Charter application and substantive issue. The court dismissed this proposal and stated that the case law implies it is the accused's obligation to lead the evidence on the voir dire. The court was not able to justify the proposed procedure. If the authorities imply there is an obligation on the accused to call evidence first on the Charter voir dire, this can occur by the application of some or all the evidence which is already on the record on the substantive issues. The admissibility of evidence can be reserved by the court pending judgment on the Charter and any s. 24 remedy. An advantage of having the Crown evidence on record at the outset is it removes uncertainty as to the nature of the testimony as it relates to the Charter application. This is preferable to the accused calling the Crown witness at the outset on the voir dire, discovering aspects of the evidence are contrary or unfavourable, and then having to convince the court to grant leave to cross-examine. It avoids a scenario where the Crown witness evidence is led by the defence on the voir dire, and then the accused must impeach the creditability of this witness in cross-examination as it relates to the proof of the substantive issues. The court concluded the fairness of the proceedings and public confidence in the administration of justice, were best served by the Crown first leading its evidence on the charge alleged and the accused having leave to request the evidence be applied to the Charter issue, if appropriate.","The issue was whether it was appropriate for the Court to require the accused to commence the trial by calling evidence on a Charter voir dire, where the accused has given notice of a Charter application. This would differ from the procedure which is usually utilized, wherein the Crown commences the trial in the trial proper and thereafter the accused applies to the court for leave to apply the Crown evidence to the Charter application, where it is appropriate to do so and in addition to calling other defence evidence on the application. HELD: The application was dismissed.  1)There will be instances where the defence will be reluctant to foreclose an inquiry into an alleged violation and there will be circumstances where no less severe order will prevent unfairness and maintain the integrity of the process.  2)In Provincial Court it is better to leave judges the discretion to determine matters such as sufficiency of notice and the extent of the offer of proof.

In 2006, the father decided to move from the west side of Saskatoon to a larger, more expensive apartment in the east side, to accommodate what he understood was Michael's interest in moving in with his grandmother and Jerrilyn, his older sister. The parties did not speak to one another, notwithstanding the difficulty it undoubtedly caused their children. HELD: 1) The mother's income was $25,672.37. The father's proportionate share was 80% and the mother's was 20%. The current s. 7 expenses total $4,261.00 yearly. 2) The father was to pay $284.00 in December 2007 for the s. 8 expenses. 3) The parties were to produce receipts for reimbursement from the father. The onus is on the parent wishing to invoke the operation of s. to demonstrate to the court's satisfaction that a shared custody arrangement as contemplated by s. is in place and has been in place over the course of year. While it is not necessary that there be a written agreement or court order to this effect before the onus can be discharged, the court should exercise caution in awarding child support in shared custody situations to ensure fairness. The mother did not bring an application to vary child support upward, the filing of the application is sufficient to re-determine the issue of child support based on current incomes. 4) Costs in the amount of $500 are payable forthwith.","[1] The respondent father applied to vary an order made May 14, 2002 by Justice M.E. Wright. Mills J. directed a trial on the issues of the residence of Michael in 2006; the incomes of the father and mother, for the purposes of the Federal Child Support Guidelines [SOR/97-175, as am.] (the “Guidelines”); and, any s. 7 expenses. I am satisfied that from September 4, 2006 until, approximately, February 22, 2007, the parties shared custody of Michael. This ended in January or February, 2007, which is a period of no more than five months.

e_2011skqb244.txt,"The appellant was convicted of impaired care and control and acquitted of a charge of care and control with a blood alcohol level exceeding .08 because of Charter violations. The appellant was senior member of the Saskatoon Police Force who was charged by members of his police force. The trial judge based his conviction on the evidence of two officers who testified that they observed signs of impairment including bloodshot, red eyes, flushed face, slurred speech, strong smell of alcohol on his breath and dry lips and mouth. In convicting the accused, the trial judge rejected the evidence of third officer who testified that the only sign of impairment he noted on scene was that the appellant had alcohol on his breath. The issues on appeal were whether the trial judge erred in his treatment of the evidence of the third officer, whether the trial judge erred in considering the observations of the other two officers as evidence to be admitted on the impaired driving count and whether the conviction for impaired driving was an unsafe verdict. HELD: The appeal was dismissed. The trial judge did not ignore or reject the evidence of the third officer. He provided extensive reasons why he preferred the evidence of the other two officers to the evidence of the third officer. The trial judge is in special position to assess the credibility of witnesses by being able to observe the witnesses as they testify and compare their observations to the testimony of the other witnesses. The findings of fact in regard to the testimony of the three police officers are supported by the transcript of their evidence and do not amount to conjecture of speculation. The trial judge made express findings of credibility with respect to the two officers and preferred their evidence to that of the third officer. There is no inherent improbability that would justify interference with the trial judge's findings on credibility. The appellant argued that the officer's evidence that the appellant had slurred speech should have been excluded because the trial judge excluded the actual statements made by the accused as violation of the accused's Charter rights under s. 10(b). Slurred speech is known physical indicator of impairment absent evidence of another cause. While statements made by an accused may not be introduced to prove impairment unless the accused has been advised of his Charter rights, physical manifestation such as slurred speech may be introduced to prove evidence of impairment. The appellant's argument that the verdict is unsafe or unreasonable was also rejected. The trial judge concluded that the Crown had proven beyond a reasonable doubt that there was evidence of impairment sufficient to meet the standard in R. v. Stellato.

The child continued to be at substantial risk of physical harm due to neglect if she was returned to the mother's care and the child would be at risk of exposure to violence if returned to the psychological father's care due to the tumultuous relationship between the mother and him. Although some improvements had recently been made in the mother's life, she had a history of frequent changes of residence and did not appear able put the child's needs ahead of her own. The Agency had not had an opportunity to assess the appropriateness of a placement with the biological father.","The Agency applied for an order of permanent care and custody with no provision for access to the child. The mother opposed the application and requested an order returning the child to her care. The biological father who had minimal contact with the child was added as a party to the order. The Agency alleged that the child had been in the care of the Agency for several years and that there had been a substantial risk of physical harm caused by the mother and psychological father's failure to supervise the child and that the risk of her safety was at risk because of her repeated moves in the family. The psychological father was considered parent or guardian pursuant to s. 36(1)(b), s. 45 and s. 46 of the Child Protection and Custody Act. HELD: 1) The child remained in the Agency's custody subject to protection finding. 2) The agency did not make an order removing the child from its care. 3) There was insufficient evidence to determine the seriousness of the consequences of the agency's decision. 4) The burden of proof in proceeding such as this was on the Agency. It was a civil burden. It must have regard to the seriousness. 5) There were no reasonable changes in the circumstances. The child was not in the physical care of her mother and the mother was with her grandmother until after court proceedings. She did not have access to a computer or the Internet. She was not involved in any of the child's medical needs or any other child care needs. The parents' relationship was complicated and there were a number of issues that had to be addressed.","[1] The Children\'s Aid Society of Cape Breton-Victoria (agency) applied for an order of Permanent Care and Custody, with no provision for access, with respect to the child, S.N.D., born [in 2003]. However, the mother has a history of frequent changes of residences and this period of stability only has been a few months. [53] Although the mother loves her child and wants to care for her she does not seem to be able to put her child\'s needs ahead of her own needs. Therefore, the Court finds that an Order for access is not appropriate with respect to the mother and psychological father. [70] The Court is satisfied that an access Order for a limited period of six months (to expire on April 13, 2006) is appropriate in order to have the father\'s parenting capacity and circumstances assessed. The Agency is to arrange for a parental capacity assessment and the father is to make himself available for an assessment.",0.2350332594235033,"The agency applied for an order of care and custody with no provision for access with respect to the child. The mother opposed the application and requested an order returning the child to her care. The biological father was residing with the mother and providing care at the time the child was apprehended.

HELD: The child remained in the agency's custody subject to the terms and conditions of the protection finding.

The second defendant successfully applied for summary judgment, with the court finding that the lessor was not liable under the Motor Vehicle Act as the lease was not a 'rental contract' as defined in s. 62 of the Act and the lessor was not an 'owner' as defined in s. 2(ak) and the current state of the law did not suggest that a claim of vicarious liability had a real chance of success between a lessor and lessee.

McMillan's opinion letters were posted on Royal Crown's website. The representative plaintiff purchased the cells and then filed tax returns claiming deduction, which was disallowed by the Canada Revenue Agency. The representative plaintiff commenced this action claiming that he and others suffered financial losses due to McMillan's negligence. McMillan applied to strike the statement of claim on the grounds that it was devoid of merit pursuant to Queen's Bench Rule 173(c) and opposed the certification of the action on the basis that the relationship between them and the representative plaintiff was insufficient to found a recognized duty of care between a lawyer and a non-client. Their application was supported by affidavits indicating that their tax opinions were not to be given to prospective investors. The plaintiff filed an affidavit from another lawyer, who deposed that when he prepared such opinion letters regarding tax consequences he reviewed all the underlying documents and agreements beforehand to protect the reputation of his law firm, knowing that the opinions were often relied upon as marketing tool to potential investors.

The defendant argued that there was sufficient reliable evidence to constitute the reasonable and probable grounds for the issuance of the warrant. HELD: The application was granted and the evidence obtained by the search was excluded under s. 24(2) of the Charter of Rights. There were at least three concerns to be addressed in weighing evidence relied on by the police to justify a warrantless search. First, was the information predicting the commission of a criminal offence compelling? Second, where that information was based on a 'tip' originating from outside the police, was that source credible? Finally, the evidence corroborated by police investigation prior to making the decision to conduct the search.

So four apparently separate and independent sources over the month and a half prior to the warrant application all confirmed, with varying amounts of detail, either that the defendant was selling drugs or that drugs were being sold or used at his apartment, or both.

c_2012nspc18.txt,"The accused was charged with numerous weapons-related offences, including possession and trafficking. The police had intercepted numerous ambiguous calls between the accused and others and had interpreted the coded language used as involving discussions about firearms. The defence had been unsuccessful in arguing that the inferences drawn were mere hunches and the conversations could not support a reasonable inference that the subjects under discussion were firearms. A search at his parents' residence had resulted in the seizure of several firearms but none were found in the accused's actual possession. One of the issues was whether the accused had constructive or joint possession of the firearms seized from his parents. Accused found guilty on all the weapons' possession charges and some of the trafficking charges, but not guilty of careless storage of a firearm. It was clear that the accused had much more than a passive or quiescent knowledge of the guns seized from his parents' home and there were a number of indicators that he had a measure of control over them, such as his telling his father on occasion to get rid of them, his being notified immediately when one of the firearms went missing, the way he pressed his parents to explain how that could happen and his ability on other occasions to tell his father where in the home a particular firearm was located. However, despite his knowledge of the location of some of the firearms at certain times, the court was unable to find that the accused had stored the firearms in the manner they were found when the search warrant was executed. The evidence also established that he was stashing guns at locations other than his residence and he possessed those guns for the purpose of transferring them to others. The only reasonable inference to be drawn from the intercepts was that the speakers were talking about guns and the communications revealed the commercial nature of the accused's activities. Given that the accused had asserted a privacy interest with respect to an application to exclude the evidence arising from the police search of the cell phone seized from him, he could not now deny that the phone was his.","The accused was charged with possession of a firearm contrary to s. 8 of the Criminal Code and possession with intent to sell. The accused had not been on the arrest list at the time of his arrest. The evidence led by the Crown established that the accused had constructive and/or joint possession of the firearms and ammunition. The intercepts were also of crucial importance to the firearms trafficking charges. HELD: The accused was found not guilty.  1)The accused could not assert a privacy interest in order to obtain the protection of s.8 of the Charter and then, when that application went badly and the evidence is admitted, turn around and claim to be a stranger to the item in which the interest resided. 2)There was nothing to the continuity/integrity of the exhibits. Reasonable doubt was based on reason and common sense and is logically connected to the evidence or lack thereof.","Also as a result of the Part VI authorized intercepts, on April 29, 2009, Kyle Cater was charged with trafficking firearms. They are: the unlawful storage of a sawed off Cooey 84 shotgun, a Lakefield Mark II rifle, and an AA Arms Model AP 9 handgun, and ammunition, in a careless manner (contrary to Criminal Code section 86(1) x 3), unlawful possession of the sawed off Cooey 84 shotgun, the Lakefield Mark II rifle and the AA Arms Model AP 9 handgun (contrary to Criminal Code section 88(1) x 3), unlawful possession of a loaded prohibited weapon – the AA Arms Model AP 9 handgun, and unlawful possession of a loaded prohibited firearm – the sawed off Cooey 84 shotgun (contrary to Criminal Code section 95(1) x 2), unlawful possession of the sawed off Cooey and the AP 9 handgun, knowing that possession is unauthorized (contrary to Criminal Code section 92(1) x 2), and unlawful possession of two over capacity magazines, a prohibited device (contrary to Criminal Code section 92(2)). [9] On February 24 at the close of the Crown’s case against Kyle, I granted an amendment to Count #8 of the January 15, 2009 Information to allege, pursuant to section 95(1) of the Criminal Code, unlawful possession by Kyle Cater of an unloaded prohibited firearm - the AA Arms Model AP 9 handgun together with readily accessible ammunition that was capable of being discharged in the firearm. [43] I am unable to accept that Kyle Cater can assert a privacy interest in order to obtain the protection of section 8 of the Charter and then, when that application goes badly and the evidence is admitted, turn around and claim to be a stranger to the item in which the privacy interest resided. [101] I have concluded that the only reasonable inference to be drawn from the intercepts is that the speakers are talking about guns. He obviously also tried to exercise a measure of control, telling his father to get rid of what was there, to no avail. [168] The “Tracey” calls on December 7 and the January 15 calls indicate that Kyle had much more than merely a passive or quiescent knowledge of the firearms and ammunition at 80 Cavendish. [171] There are a number of indicators of Kyle Cater having a measure of control over the firearms at 80 Cavendish. Accordingly I find him guilty of Counts 4, 5 and 6 of the Information sworn January 15, 2009, unlawful possession of the sawed off Cooey shotgun, the Mark II Lakefield rifle, and the AA Arms AP 9 handgun, contrary to section 88(1) of the Criminal Code. I also find him guilty of Count 7, unlawful possession of a loaded prohibited firearm, a sawed off Cooey shotgun, contrary to section 95(1) of the Criminal Code, and of the amended Count 8, unlawful possession of an unloaded prohibited firearm, the AA Arms AP 9 handgun together with readily accessible ammunition capable of being discharged in the firearm, contrary to section 95(1) of the Criminal Code. [179] I further find Kyle Cater guilty of Counts 9 and 10 of unlawfully possessing the Cooey and the AP 9 knowing their possession was unauthorized, contrary to section 92(1) of the Criminal Code. And I find him guilty of Count 11, unlawfully possessing a prohibited device, two over-capacity magazines, contrary to section 92(2) of the Criminal Code. I am acquitting him of those charges. However I am not able to find beyond a reasonable doubt that Kyle had stored the three firearms in the manner they were found on January 15. I infer this from Intercept 7, a conversation on December 2, 2008 with D.M. and from the evidence that establishes Kyle was stashing his guns at locations other than where he was living. I find that the purpose of Kyle’s possession was offering to transfer it, that is, his purpose conforms to the Criminal Code definition of “transfer.” It was a firearms trafficking purpose. [207] My conclusions on the firearms trafficking charges can be summarized as follows: I find the Crown has proven beyond a reasonable doubt that Kyle Cater is guilty of Counts 3 and 4, relating to the .410 gauge shotgun; Counts 5 and 6, relating to the Derringer; Counts 7 and 8, relating to the .308 calibre rifle; and guilty of possession of the .45 calibre handgun for the purpose of offering to transfer it. [208] I acquit Kyle Cater of Counts 9, 10, 11 and 12 on the firearms trafficking Information. I find Kyle to be guilty of the possession of the .45 calibre firearm on December 28, 2008, a finding I am making in relation to Count 1 of the Information, not as specifically charged under Count 9 of the Information as I find that on or about December 7, 2008, Kyle Cater did not have possession of the .45 calibre handgun he was discussing at that time with I.E.",0.17925478348439075,"The accused was charged with numerous weapons-related offences, including possession and trafficking.

I find Kyle to be guilty of the possession of the .45 calibre firearm on December 28, 2008, a finding I am making in relation to Count 1 of the Information, not as specifically charged under Count 9 of the Information as I find that on or about December 7, 2008, Kyle Cater did not have possession of the .45 calibre handgun he was discussing at that time with I.E.",0.25215348472983556,"The accused’s stepmother called him early in the morning with the news that there had been a police raid on the home she shared with the accused. The police found two guns, a sawed off shotgun, a Lakefield Mark II rifle and ammunition, in a careless manner. The intercepts were also of significant importance to the firearms trafficking charges. The accused was charged with possession of firearms and ammunition contrary to s. 8 and s. 9 of the Criminal Code. At issue was whether the accused had constructive and/or joint possession of the firearms. HELD: 1)The accused was presumed to be innocent until the Crown proved he was guilty beyond a reasonable doubt. 2)The evidence collected from the accused was that the sawed-off shotgun and ammunition were found in a box in the master bedroom of their home.  3)Evidence collected through various case management conferences and the assistance of the Canada Firearms Centre had not been dispensed with.  4)Although evidence collected at the scene of the search had been considered at trial, it was not accepted that the accused could assert a privacy interest in order to obtain protection of s.8 of the Charter and then, when that application went badly and the evidence is admitted, turn around and claim to be a stranger to the item in which the privacy interest resided. 5)There was nothing to suggest that the guns and ammunition introduced as evidence in this trial were not the ones that were located in the other two individuals’ home. The evidence collected through the course of the trial was that of a witness. The witness’ testimony did not meet the burden of proof and there was no suggestion of a continuity problem.  6)Evidence obtained through the destruction of the evidence and the exchange of photographs between the parties was not considered relevant to the charges. 7)Statutes of the Custody and Interpretation of the Evidence and the Access to Information Act were not to be relied upon. The Crown and the accused were jointly responsible for the search of the premises. 8)The Crown had not established that the contents of the three guns seized were a prohibited device within s. 84(1) of the Code and a section of Part II of the Regulations. 9)Countries were not required to accept the evidence of the persons who possessed the firearms at the time of their arrest. 10)Counts were not issued pursuant to the Part VI authorization.  11)The essential issue on the firearms seized from the victims was whether Kyle had constructive possession of them.  12)",0.24752475247524755
6_2014skqb59.txt,"Family Law – Spousal Support – RetroactiveThe petitioner commenced a family law proceeding requesting divorce and equal division of family property in 2010. She did not seek spousal support as part of her original application to the Court. In August of 2013, the petitioner sought to amend her petition to include a claim for spousal support based on the Spousal Support Advisory Guidelines. In January of 2014, the petitioner filed an application for interim spousal support retroactive to the date of separation. HELD: The petitioner was awarded spousal support, but the award was not retroactive to the date of separation. The petitioner was entitled to spousal support from the date that she put the respondent on notice of her application for spousal support. The respondent, at age 61, should not be forced to work overtime in order to meet his spousal support obligations. The Court found there was economic disparity between the income of the petitioner and the income of the respondent and awarded an interim award of non-compensatory spousal support in the amount of $400 per month, retroactive to November 1, 2013, until further order of the Court.","FIAT: The petitioner commenced this family law proceeding by issuing a petition in which she sought divorce and equal division of the family property estate. The petitioner did not seek any form of corollary relief pursuant to the provisions of the Divorce Act, R.S.C. 1985, c. (2nd Supp.). Specifically, she did not claim for spousal support. HELD: The application was granted. 1)The court found ample authority for the proposition that retroactive support should be left to final adjudication and not be granted upon an interim application.  2)The respondent was 61 years old. His regular hourly rate of pay is $28.50. The respondent argues that he cannot keep up the pace of working overtime hours as he did in previous years. In assessing support, whether child support or spousa support, the court does not compel a payor to work overtime. The evidence establishes that the respondent's gross income in the year 2013, to his pay period ending December 14, 2013, was $95,275.73. This latter sum included $28,553.68 of overtime income. [3] The respondent is 61 year old. He earns rental income from leasing farm land. The net rental income, after payment of property taxes, yields $8,000 to the respondent. Given his age and given his state of health, this Court will not compel the respondent to work more than a 40 hour work week by attributing to him an income which is based upon significant overtime. An application to amend the petition, amongst other relief sought, was consented to by the parties on October 17, 2013 and granted October 22, 2013. [4]The petitioner was awarded costs of $1,200.00 payable by the father.  5)The Court found that the economic disparity between the respondent and petitioner's incomes was $79,320.00 versus $56,103.00, is sufficiently disparate and upon which an interim award of non-compensatory support is appropriate.  6)The petitioner is in receipt of CPP benefits of $6,540 per annum.","[11] For the foregoing reasons, and in accordance with the quoted case law, this Court will not grant retroactive spousal support prior to the respondent being put on effective notice that the petitioner was now seeking spousal support.

The Court found that the accused possessed sufficient understanding of the circumstances surrounding the accident to conclude that the blood demand was a legitimate demand for sample and that he had not waived his right to counsel as required by law.

2011nssc455.txt,"The accused, who was charged with 21 counts under one indictment relating to events on two separate dates, applied to have the counts severed. First, on the basis of the dates of the occurrences and, secondly, to separate the so-called 'status offences' based on a pre-existing firearm prohibition order. It was argued the Crown had combined all the counts into one indictment to improve its evidentiary position with regard to the unproven connection of possession of the gun on the two separate dates and to be able to cross-examine the accused on the events of both days should he choose to only testify on the events of one day. The Crown argued that expert evidence showing a match between the gun used in the shooting on the first date and that found by the arresting officers on the second date showed a temporal and continuity nexus between the two events. The accused's  videotaped statement to the police was also a common piece of evidence to both dates. Application for severance dismissed. The most significant issue was the possibility of the accused being subject to cross-examination for events of both days if he chose to testify only concerning the events of one day but his position that he had no association with the gun and that it was not in his possession on either day indicated that his decision on whether to testify would most likely be the same in relation to both sets of counts and, given that there was no jury involved, there was no risk of improper inferences being drawn. The Crown should not be limited in the presentation of its evidence through a severance of counts because of the tenuous nexus between the two events.","The accused is charged with 21 counts under an indictment dated September 1, 2010 consisting of one count of attempted murder, several charges pertaining to the unlawful possession and use of a firearm, and a number of status offences based on a pre-existing firearm prohibition order. The accused seeks severance of the 21 counts in the indictment on two bases which, if granted, would require three separate trials in all. HELD: The application for severance is dismissed on both the bases proposed. 1)The interests of justice encompass the accused's right to be tried on the evidence admissible against him, as well as society's interest in seeing that justice is done in reasonably efficient and cost-effective manner. 2)The evidence that the gun was recovered near the spot where the accused was arrested would be admissible on a prosecution of April 8th events if it supported an inference that the accused is in possession of that firearm on that date. If this were to be a trial by jury, severance on that basis would be appropriate because of the risk of propensity reasoning by the trier of fact. There is no such risk in having all the counts tried together and further delay would thereby be avoided while he is in custody. 3)Sellance is required in the interest of justice, as per s. 591(3) of the Code. The interests encompass a multiplicity of offences having little legal or factual nexus. The issues are different (identity on the former, and knowledge and control of the gun on the latter) and there is no common evidence. The only possible link conceded is the firearm which assumes an unproven connection of possession of the firearm on both days. It is argued that it would be unjust for the accused to be placed in the position of wanting to testify with respect to the April 8 and April 14th but not in respect of the April 15th events. The court may, where it is satisfied, order the accused or defendant be tried separately on one or more of the counts. 4)While an accused's stated and objectively justifiable intention to testify on some but not all counts is not necessarily determinative of a severance application, it can be counterbalanced by other circumstances that the judge finds may prevent the accused from testifying or be outweighed by factors that demonstrate that the interests require a joint trial","[1] The accused is charged with 21 counts under an indictment dated September 1, 2010 consisting of one count of attempted murder, several charges pertaining to the unlawful possession and use of a firearm, and a number of status offences based on a pre-existing firearm prohibition order.

The applicant sought an order pursuant to s.87 and s. 251 of the Land Titles Act, cancelling the existing Certificate of Title in the name of the respondent and herself as joint tenants and directing the Registrar to issue a new title in their joint names with right of survivorship. The sellers were not represented by legal counsel. They prepared a transfer of the property and sent it to the Land Tittles Office for registration. On August 20, 1997, a mortgage was registered by the lawyer on August 21, 1997. The error describing the purchasers on the title went unnoticed by the owner. The lawyer acknowledged that it was a mistake that the title issued as it did and that the mistake was not noticed by him when he reviewed the documents.

Therefore the accused’s suggestion that he had an honest but mistaken belief in consent cannot be considered because I cannot cobble together from the totality of the evidence sufficient evidence from which it could be said that the accused could have drawn an honestly held belief or from which he could have honestly inferred that the complainant had consented to his touching her . [68] Therefore I am satisfied that the Crown has proven beyond a reasonable doubt that the accused sexually assaulted the complainant in both courtroom #10 and in the Youth Court general office. He is guilty as charged.",0.25,"The accused is charged with committing a sexual assault contrary to s. 271 of the Criminal Code. The accused was police officer with the Regina Police Service for 25 years until he retired in 1999 with the rank of Deputy Chief of Police. In the fall of 2001, he was appointed Justice of the Peace. The Crown proceeded summarily. The first incident involved the accused bringing the complainant's hand to his crotch. The second incident involved the accused touching the complainant's breast and crotch and trying to kiss her. The issues are whether the Crown proved the actus reus and mens rea of the offence. HELD: The accused is guilty of sexually assaulting the complainant in both courtroom 10 and the Youth Court general office. 1) The alleged touching occurred and it was of a sexual nature. The complainant did not consent to the contact. 2) The parties, along with most of the employees in the building, were often subject to or the source of numerous crude jokes and comments of a sexual nature. The accused believed that his discussions with the complainant about such matters were serious. However, at no time did the accused express his desire to get to know her or to see her outside of the workplace. He did not raise the possibility of physical relationship nor did she express any interest in sexual liaison. When he suggested it, she was not enthusiastic. The interactions described by the accused are more consistent with normal interaction between persons in that particular workplace than with an indication of consent to sexual activity. Looking at all the evidence, there is nothing to support an honest belief on the part of the accused that the complainant consented to the sexual contact. The accused's suggestion that he had an honest but mistaken belief in consent cannot be considered because the Court could not cobble together from the totality of the evidence sufficient evidence from which it could be said that the accused could have drawn an honestly held belief or from which he could have honestly inferred that the complainant had consented to his touching her.","The accused was charged that, on or about August 21, 2003, he did commit a sexual assault on the complainant contrary to s. 271 of the Criminal Code. The Crown elected to proceed summarily. The complainant was employed as clerk at the Provincial Court Building. She assumed her duties in 1998 and although she testified that she knew of the accused in 1999, it was much more likely that she met him in the spring of 2002 after he assumed his duties as Justice of the Peace in the same building. HELD: The accused was found guilty of both charges. 1)The complainant was flabbergasted by the charges and believed that there was never ever any indication that she wasn't consenting to it. The statement could be used in cross-examination for the purpose of attacking the credibility of the witness. 2)The accused gave his evidence in an honest and straightforward fashion. He was vigorously cross-examined. While his recollection was not perfect and his evidence was not consistent on every point, believe that he did his best to relate his evidence as accurately as he could recall it. 3)There was some consistency as to the incidents that occurred prior to August 21 and the same cannot be said about the events of August 21.","[1] Mr. Toupin is charged that, on or about the 21st day of August, A.D. 2003, at or near[…], Saskatchewan, he did commit a sexual assault on T.D. contrary to section 271 of the Criminal Code. Issues [42] a. Whether the Crown has proven the actus reus of the offence, and
b. Whether the Crown has proven the mens rea of the offence.

7_2018skqb90.txt,"Civil Procedure – Queen’s Bench Rules, Rule 6-75 The applicant insurance company sought an order for interpleader pursuant to Queen’s Bench rule 6-75 regarding premium surpluses it held in the amount of $3,550,800 that were generated between 1990, when it issued a group life insurance policy to the respondent, Agricultural Credit Corporation (Ag Credit), and 2015, when Ag Credit terminated the policy. The applicant requested that the monies be paid into court and that directions be provided as to how the determination of ownership would be decided. Ag Credit took the position that the funds paid as premiums were Crown funds and thus any surpluses were the property of the Crown and properly payable to Ag Credit as its agent. It argued that the interpleader order was unnecessary. The purpose of the group life insurance was to ensure that outstanding loans made by Ag Credit to borrowers were paid in the event of the borrowers’ deaths. Individual borrowers paid the premiums applicable to them by paying those amounts to Ag Credit, who remitted the payments to the applicant. There was no clear direction regarding the surpluses in the policy or in the Superintendent of Insurance Guidelines or applicable legislation. HELD: The application was granted subject to the court hearing further submissions from both parties regarding such things as whether the surplus should be paid into court or left to be administered by the applicant during the proceedings. The court found that the insurance company was entitled to some form of interpleader relief and dismissed Ag Credit’s claim to the surplus. It ordered that a representative be appointed to represent the class of insured clients in the proceedings in order to determine who was entitled to the surplus.","The ultimate issue in these proceedings is who is entitled to certain insurance premium surpluses totalling $3,552,881.00 as of October 31, 2016 plus interest accrued since. Empire Life Insurance claims no interest in the funds but is concerned that the claim of Ag Credit to these funds is not clear and that the rights to refund of such surplus may belong to individual borrowers of the insurer whose lives were insured over the years under the Policy and whom it views as having paid the premiums resulting in the surplus. Thus it seeks to interplead, pay the monies into court and have the Court give directions as to how the determination of ownership will be decided including what persons will be given notice of the proceedings. HELD: 1) While interpleader relief is appropriate, the appropriate form and nature of additional relief or direction is not immediately apparent. The phrase 'public money' is not found within Ag Credit's Act. The argument that since by definition any monies received by Ag Credit are public money within the meaning of the Financial Administration Act, 1993, they are also therefore 'Public money' under Ag Credit’s Act and thus Crown property for the present purposes is non-sequitur. 2) While the insured clients’ class needs to participate in assisting the Court in determining whether Ag Credit or they as class are entitled to receive the surplus by virtue of the language of the Policy, the economic realities of the litigation necessarily involved needs to be recognized. 3) The insurer has acted in full compliance with its duty of uberrima fides in bringing the potentially valid claims of its insured clients to the attention of the Court and in resisting the claim that Ag Credit was entitled to a surplus. The insurer is willing to pay monies directly to the insurer. 4) It does not collude with any of the claimants. 5) Given the absence of clear direction in the policy and any legislation or Superintendent of Insurance Guidelines, it is reasonable to conclude that the surplus belongs to the insured client class. It is in the interests of all parties that the funds actually remain in the hands of Empire Life, with the potential of continuing to earn interest, rather than be placed on deposit with the Court while this matter proceeds forward to final decision.","[4] In its application Ag Credit takes the positions that:
a. The funds paid as premiums were Crown funds and thus any surpluses are the property of the Crown and properly payable to it as the Crown’s agent;
b. Since no other person has a competing interest to Ag Credit’s right and title, the interpleader order sought by Empire Life is unnecessary; [24] Without limiting the scope of arguments that will ultimately be advanced by any party, I have decided, for the reasons outlined below, that I will be appointing a representative party to advance the case and interests of the insured clients class. [25] Given my conclusion that insured clients under the Policy have an arguable claim to the surpluses in question and since Ag Credit maintains its claim to these same funds, this is an appropriate case to grant interpleader relief under Rule 6‑75 of The Queen’s Bench Rules. Conclusion [37] The decisions I have made herein can be summarized as follows:
a. I dismiss Ag Credit’s application for an order that the surplus funds be paid to it on the grounds I have categorized as peremptory basis claims;
b. Empire Life is entitled to some form of interpleader relief in respect of the surplus funds;
c. A representative will be appointed to represent the class of insured clients in the proceedings to determine whom as between Ag Credit and those clients is entitled to the surplus in question;
d. In light of these decisions, I wish to hear further submissions from Ag Credit and Empire Life as to:

The insurer may apply ex parte to the court for an order for payment of money into court, if any, as it deems necessary, and make appropriate orders as to notice and procedure to deal with adverse claims. 4) While some of the borrowers may have defaulted in payment of loan obligations and/or related insurance premiums and Ag Credit may have chosen to nonetheless pay the premiums on their behalf, there is no evidence that this type of payment has occurred within the confines of the Act.","[4] In its application Ag Credit takes the positions that:
a. The funds paid as premiums were Crown funds and thus any surpluses are the property of the Crown and properly payable to it as the Crown’s agent;
b.

Whether the surplus should be paid into court or can continue to be administered by Empire Life during the ensuing proceedings;",0.1908831908831909,"Civil Procedure – Queen’s Bench Rules, Rule 6-75 The applicant insurance company sought an order for interpleader pursuant to Queen’s Bench rule 6-75 regarding premium surpluses it held in the amount of $3,550,800 that were generated between 1990, when it issued a group life insurance policy to the respondent, Agricultural Credit Corporation (Ag Credit), and 2015, when Ag Credit terminated the policy. The applicant requested that the monies be paid into court and that directions be provided as to how the determination of ownership would be decided. Ag Credit took the position that the funds paid as premiums were Crown funds and thus any surpluses were the property of the Crown and properly payable to Ag Credit as its agent. It argued that the interpleader order was unnecessary. The purpose of the group life insurance was to ensure that outstanding loans made by Ag Credit to borrowers were paid in the event of the borrowers’ deaths. Individual borrowers paid the premiums applicable to them by paying those amounts to Ag Credit, who remitted the payments to the applicant. There was no clear direction regarding the surpluses in the policy or in the Superintendent of Insurance Guidelines or applicable legislation. HELD: The application was granted subject to the court hearing further submissions from both parties regarding such things as whether the surplus should be paid into court or left to be administered by the applicant during the proceedings. The court found that the insurance company was entitled to some form of interpleader relief and dismissed Ag Credit’s claim to the surplus. It ordered that a representative be appointed to represent the class of insured clients in the proceedings in order to determine who was entitled to the surplus.","The ultimate issue in these proceedings is who is entitled to certain insurance premium surpluses totalling $3,552,881.00 as of October 31, 2016 plus interest accrued since. Empire Life is in possession of the funds. It claims no interest in the funds but is concerned that the claim of Ag Credit to these funds is not clear and that the rights to refund of such surplus may belong to individual borrowers of the policy and whom it views as having paid the premiums resulting in the surplus. Thus it seeks to interplead, pay the monies into court and have the Court give directions as to how the determination of ownership will be made. HELD: 1) While interpleader relief is appropriate, the appropriate form and nature of additional relief or direction is not immediately apparent.

Empire Life Insurance claims no interest in the funds but is concerned that the claim of Ag Credit to these funds is not clear and that the rights to refund of such surplus may belong to individual borrowers of the insurer whose lives were insured over the years under the Policy and whom it views as having paid the premiums resulting in the surplus.

HELD: 1) While interpleader relief is appropriate, the appropriate form and nature of additional relief or direction is not immediately apparent. The phrase 'public money' is not found within Ag Credit's Act. The argument that since by definition any monies received by Ag Credit are public money within the meaning of the Financial Administration Act, 1993, they are also therefore 'Public money' under Ag Credit’s Act and thus Crown property for the present purposes is non-sequitur. 2) While the insured clients’ class needs to participate in assisting the Court in determining whether Ag Credit or they as class are entitled to receive the surplus by virtue of the language of the Policy, the economic realities of the litigation necessarily involved needs to be recognized. 3) The insurer has acted in full compliance with its duty of uberrima fides in bringing the potentially valid claims of its insured clients to the attention of the Court and in resisting the claim that Ag Credit was entitled to a surplus. The insurer is willing to pay monies directly to the insurer. 4) It does not collude with any of the claimants. 5) Given the absence of clear direction in the policy and any legislation or Superintendent of Insurance Guidelines, it is reasonable to conclude that the surplus belongs to the insured client class.

e_2001skqb466.txt,"The plaintiff sought damages for personal injuries to her lower back, right knee and left ankle sustained when she slipped and fell while grocery shopping in March 2000. The defendant acknowledged the plaintiff fell in its produce department, but did not concede the water on the floor caused her to slip; the cause was, in part, her worn running shoes without laces. Liability and degree of personal injury were in issue. The claim proceeded under the simplified procedure under Part Forty of the Queen's Bench Rules. HELD: The claim was dismissed with costs. 1)The defendant had a duty of care to the plaintiff as owner and occupier. The courts have most often based the duty of care on the invitor/invitee standard. Maxay v. Ramsay Drugs proposed four-part inquiry to determine whether or not an occupier has breached its duty of care. 2)The plaintiff established on a balance of probabilities that she slipped because of water on the floor. The evidence did not support an inference that her footwear caused the slip or was a contributing factor. 3)An adverse inference was not drawn from the defendant's failure to adduce evidence confirming its employee had in fact cleaned the floor. The employee was no longer employed by the defendant. Neither party was able to locate him. 4)Some of her injuries were, in part, the aggravation of pre-existing conditions. The most significant injury was sprain to her left ankle, which had not been resolved primarily because the plaintiff declined to accept available treatment and failed to follow medical advice. The inconsistencies in her affidavit and the physician notes or medical reports respecting her injuries and treatment were not relevant to this decision. 5)A 'sweep log' was kept for each department and employees made regular inspections of the sales floor area in every department. The plaintiff slipped and fell about an hour after the last sweeping. A regular program of maintenance was conducted in the area. The overall policies and practices of regular maintenance and responsibility of each employee were substantially the same if not identical to those considered in the Mollenhauer and Libel group of cases. The defendant met the legal standard of care imposed in the circumstances and was not liable for the plaintiff's injuries.

These findings leave only the third of the four ""Maxay"" principles to be addressed. 3)There have been many cases that have found slippery substance such as water or produce on the floor of grocery store to constitute an unusual danger. On the basis of all of the evidence, the plaintiff has met the burden of establishing on a balance of probabilities that she slipped because of water on her floor of the store. However, some of the injuries appear to have been at least in part the aggravation of pre-existing conditions. 4)The plaintiff did not contest the presence of water in the vicinity of where she fell although it does not concede that it was the water which caused the plaintiff to slip.","[1] The plaintiff seeks damages for personal injuries sustained when she slipped and fell while grocery shopping in the defendant's Superstore in Regina on March 28, 2000. The defendant places in issue:

(a) Whether it is liable to the plaintiff for the injuries she sustained in this slip and fall accident; and

(b) The degree of personal injury sustained by the plaintiff as a result of the accident. The plaintiff's affidavit asserted that on March 28, 2000 she was shopping in the produce department of the defendant's Superstore located at 1621 Albert Street in Regina when at approximately 3:45 p.m. she suddenly slipped on a puddle of water on the floor and fell heavily to the ground, injuring her lower back, right knee and left ankle. Suffice it to say that some of the injuries the plaintiff claimed occurred as a result of her slip and fall on March 28, 2000, appear to have been at least in part the aggravation of pre-existing conditions. A ""sweep log"" was kept for each department and entries of these cleaning activities were made and initialled by the employees performing the work. CONCLUSION [11] The defendant, as owner and occupier of the Superstore, had a duty of care to the plaintiff. On the basis of all of the evidence, I am satisfied that the plaintiff has met the burden of establishing on a balance of probabilities that she slipped because of water on the floor of the store. The evidence does not support an inference that the plaintiff's footwear caused or was a contributing factor to the slip and fall. A regular program of maintenance had been conducted by the defendant in that area of the store. [21] I conclude that the defendant met the legal standard of care imposed upon it in the circumstances and is not liable for the injuries suffered by the plaintiff. To find otherwise would be to impose a standard upon the defendant in this case that is inconsistent with that previously imposed by this Court in almost identical circumstances. [22] Accordingly, the plaintiff's claim is dismissed with costs.

The plaintiff's affidavit asserted that on March 28, 2000 she was shopping in the produce department of the defendant's Superstore located at 1621 Albert Street in Regina when at approximately 3:45 p.m. she suddenly slipped on a puddle of water on the floor and fell heavily to the ground, injuring her lower back, right knee and left ankle. Suffice it to say that some of the injuries the plaintiff claimed occurred as a result of her slip and fall on March 28, 2000, appear to have been at least in part the aggravation of pre-existing conditions. A ""sweep log"" was kept for each department and entries of these cleaning activities were made and initialled by the employees performing the work. CONCLUSION [11] The defendant, as owner and occupier of the Superstore, had a duty of care to the plaintiff. On the basis of all of the evidence, I am satisfied that the plaintiff has met the burden of establishing on a balance of probabilities that she slipped because of water on the floor of the store. The evidence does not support an inference that the plaintiff's footwear caused or was a contributing factor to the slip and fall. A regular program of maintenance had been conducted by the defendant in that area of the store. [21] I conclude that the defendant met the legal standard of care imposed upon it in the circumstances and is not liable for the injuries suffered by the plaintiff. To find otherwise would be to impose a standard upon the defendant in this case that is inconsistent with that previously imposed by this Court in almost identical circumstances. [22] Accordingly, the plaintiff's claim is dismissed with costs.
",0.33034571062740076,"The plaintiff sought damages for personal injuries to her lower back, right knee and left ankle sustained when she slipped and fell while grocery shopping in March 2000. The defendant acknowledged the plaintiff fell in its produce department, but did not concede the water on the floor caused her to slip; the cause was, in part, her worn running shoes without laces. Liability and degree of personal injury were in issue. The claim proceeded under the simplified procedure under Part Forty of the Queen's Bench Rules. HELD: The claim was dismissed with costs. 1)The defendant had a duty of care to the plaintiff as owner and occupier. The courts have most often based the duty of care on the invitor/invitee standard. Maxay v. Ramsay Drugs proposed four-part inquiry to determine whether or not an occupier has breached its duty of care. 2)The plaintiff established on a balance of probabilities that she slipped because of water on the floor. The evidence did not support an inference that her footwear caused the slip or was a contributing factor. 3)An adverse inference was not drawn from the defendant's failure to adduce evidence confirming its employee had in fact cleaned the floor. The employee was no longer employed by the defendant. Neither party was able to locate him. 4)Some of her injuries were, in part, the aggravation of pre-existing conditions. The most significant injury was sprain to her left ankle, which had not been resolved primarily because the plaintiff declined to accept available treatment and failed to follow medical advice. The inconsistencies in her affidavit and the physician notes or medical reports respecting her injuries and treatment were not relevant to this decision. 5)A 'sweep log' was kept for each department and employees made regular inspections of the sales floor area in every department. The plaintiff slipped and fell about an hour after the last sweeping. A regular program of maintenance was conducted in the area. The overall policies and practices of regular maintenance and responsibility of each employee were substantially the same if not identical to those considered in the Mollenhauer and Libel group of cases. The defendant met the legal standard of care imposed in the circumstances and was not liable for the plaintiff's injuries. To find otherwise would be to impose a standard that is inconsistent with that previously imposed by this court in almost identical circumstances.","The plaintiff sought damages for injuries sustained when she slipped and fell while grocery shopping in the defendant's Superstore. The defendant placed an issue on whether it was liable to the plaintiff for injuries she sustained in the slip and fall and the degree of personal injury sustained by the plaintiff as a result of the accident. HELD: The claim was dismissed with costs. 1)The defendant met the legal standard of care imposed upon it in the circumstances and was not liable for the injuries suffered. A regular program of maintenance had been conducted by the defendant in that area of the store. The overall policies and practices of regular maintenance of the floor areas combined with the responsibility of each employee to carry them out were substantially the same if not identical to those considered by the Court in the Mollenhauer and Leibel group of cases. 2)There have been many cases that have found slippery substance such as water or produce on the floor of grocery store to constitute an unusual danger. However, the defendant did not know the water was there, but did know that water and other substances could be on the Floor of the produce department, and also knew that reasonable steps must be taken to safeguard against the very type of accident experienced by plaintiff. The evidence did not support an inference that the plaintiff's footwear caused or was a contributing factor to the fall. 3)There was no evidence that any of the defendants, including the owner and occupier, had any reasonable care to prevent damage from the 'unusual danger' described in Maxay v. Ramsay Drugs Ltd. (1991), Maurice J. proposed a four part inquiry to determine whether or not an occupier has breached its duty of care to an invitee. 4)There were no logs filed by the defendants prior to the date of the incident. If any, they were destroyed by the impact of the impact on the plaintiff. 5)No logs were filed with respect to the time the plaintiff had to vacate the premises to rest and see her family doctor if her injuries did not improve.  6)Statutes filed as required by the simplified procedure included the names and addresses of persons who might reasonably be expected to have knowledge of the events. Notes and medical reports were not filed with the court. Notes were not prepared for the purpose of this inquiry. Some of the injuries were at least in part the aggravation of pre-existing conditions.","[1] The plaintiff seeks damages for personal injuries sustained when she slipped and fell while grocery shopping in the defendant's Superstore in Regina on March 28, 2000.

[7] The accused did not appear for trial on March 6, 2000 and a Canada wide warrant for his arrest was issued. As to the surety, the Crown submitted that under s. 771(2) of the Criminal Code sureties have a responsibility to ensure the attendance at trial of the person for whom they go bail and are responsible for getting out of prison and, therefore, the surety should be responsible for the full $1,000.00. [19] I conclude that Mr. Bryant had no concept of his obligations under the recognizance. In these circumstances I am satisfied that it would not be just nor appropriate to order forfeiture on the part of Mr. Bryant. [22] Turning next to the case of the accused, for very different reasons I have concluded as well that forfeiture ought not to be ordered against him. The accused is impecunious; he has no income and no assets other than an apparatus worth a few dollars that enables him to drive a motor vehicle. Thus, the accused would potentially be liable for a double punishment for his failure to appear for trial which is not acceptable in our system of criminal justice. [25] Accordingly, the applications for forfeiture are dismissed.",0.25203252032520324,The Crown applied pursuant to s. 771 for an order forfeiting the amount of bail set out in a recognizance entered into by the accused and the surety. HELD: The application for forfeiture was dismissed. 1) The surety had no concept of his obligations under the recognizizance. He mistakenly believed that his responsibilities or liability ended with the accused's first appearance in Court following his release. Certainly he was not aware that he himself could be subject to imprisonment under s.773 in the event of default and was not made aware of that fact.  2) The accused has had enough on his plate and is experiencing enough negative factors to outweigh his jurisdiction. The court has concluded that forfeiture should not be ordered against him.,0.2108108108108108

The court was satisfied there were degenerative changes in the plaintiffs spine which were accelerated by the accident. The pain problems were caused or contributed to by the defendant's negligence. An award for lost wages was also reduced by a factor of 33.%.","This was an action for damages for injuries suffered by the plaintiff as a result of a motor vehicle accident. The plaintiff was stopped on the Cole Harbour Road by a flagman to allow piece of heavy machinery to back out onto the road. Her motor vehicle was struck from behind by the vehicle operated by the defendant. The damage to the plaintiff's motor vehicle consisted of a bent bumper which had to be replaced at a cost of $528.61. The injuries were aggravated by the motor vehicle crash.

On the totality of the evidence presented, I am satisfied that at the time of the accident the plaintiff was undergoing degenerative changes in her spine. I find that the plaintiff has discharged its burden of establishing, on a balance of probabilities, that the described pain problems were caused, or contributed to, by the defendant\'s negligence. I find that for this injury the plaintiff is entitled to an award in the amount of $15,000. With respect to the lower back injury, I find that the plaintiff is entitled to an award in the amount of $75,000; however, not all of this is attributable to the defendant\'s negligence. I find that the defendant is liable for 33.33 percent of this sum and, accordingly, the plaintiff shall receive $25,000 for her lower back injury. As to loss of income, I find that the plaintiff has lost income in the amount of $102,753.92 for the years 1988 to 1992.

The landlords are mother and son. The mother lives out of province for a number of years. She returns in summers to reside in the premises. This year she wanted to return to her premises on a full time basis. She found that her son had rented out a portion of the house to a Tenant and had signed a 3 year lease. She sought an order that the Tenant vacate the premises. The Hearing Officer found he had no jurisdiction to deal with the dispute between the two landlords. He found he could only deal with the situation between the landlords and the tenant and found that the tenant had signed a lease in good faith and is entitled to the rights the lease affords and is entitled to remain in the premises. HELD: There was no valid tenancy agreement. The Act only applies to tenancy agreements and to circumstances where rental units or residential property is validly rented by a landlord to a tenant. In the circumstances, the Hearing Officer did not have jurisdiction to deal with this dispute. However, the Hearing Officer did err in law in determining that the tenant was entitled to the rights that the lease affords. 1) A room in a house is a rental unit capable of being the subject of a tenancy. 2) Clearly there was no participation by both owners in entering into this lease agreement. Mr. Koch's evidence would lead to the opposite conclusion. There was no express consent of principal and agent.  3) The facts as described by the Hearing Officer do not support an agency by estoppel. This can arise where one person has acted so as to lead another to believe that he or she has authorized a third person, without any actual authority, to act on his behalf and that other person, in such belief, enters into a transaction with that third person.

Those circumstances do not exist here and conclude that the Hearing Officer did not err in law in deciding that the tenant was entitled to the rights that the lease affords. 2) There was no valid tenancy agreement between the tenant and the landlord. The tenant was not at fault in this situation. He signed a lease in good faith and did not intend to act for his mother. He was acting for himself and asserting that he had that right. 3) The Hearing Officer erred by declaring that the landlord had not provided the tenant with a written agreement that substantially complies with the provisions of the tenancy agreement.  4) The tenant's obligation to pay rent is suspended if the landlord gives notice without the consent of all joint tenants. 5) The landlord may have remedies against the tenant for any damages he has suffered as a result of his dealings with the tenant. 6) The tenancy agreement is not invalid if the tenant fails to provide the information required of the landlord pursuant to s. 7(f)(i) or s. 8(f) of the Act. 7) It is just and equitable for an order to be made pursuant to ss. 7 and 8 of the Code of Conduct. 8) In any situation where one person has so acted so as to lead another to believe that he or she has authorized a third person to act on his or her behalf, and that other person, in such belief, enters into a transaction with that third person, it is in the public interest to hold a hearing.

d_2005nsca71.txt,"The appellant was convicted of sexual assault. The court disbelieved his evidence, principally because it was found to be internally inconsistent. The court found that the appellant had attempted to portray himself as being good to the children but had admitted on cross-examination that the children had been removed from the home due to allegations of physical abuse and lack of food. There was no evidence before the court as to the truth of these allegations and the appellant had stated in his evidence that everyone thought that he treated the children badly. The appellant appealed. Appeal allowed; conviction set aside; new trial ordered. The trial judge misapprehended the evidence because she attributed to it a relevance that it could not have in law or in logic. The appellants evidence about the involvement of Childrens Services did not permit the judge to draw any inference that the children had, in fact, been badly treated or that the appellant was responsible for such treatment. The misapprehension, examined in the context of the judges reasons as a whole and the entire record was substantial, material and played an essential part in the judges reasoning leading to the conviction; the misapprehension had given rise to a miscarriage of justice.","The appellant appeals his conviction on a charge of sexual assault. He testified at trial, denying the charge, but the trial judge disbelieved his evidence. On appeal, the appellant says that his conviction is a miscarriage of justice because the judge based her rejection of his evidence on material misapprehensions of the evidence. HELD: The conviction is set aside and a new trial ordered. 1) The court found that the judge misapprehended the evidence on this point by failing to give proper effect to it. The judge's reasons for rejecting the accused's testimony and finding that it did not raise reasonable doubt are based on misappreciation of the trial record. 2) There was no other way in which the appellant's evidence could be viewed as internally inconsistent.

b_2006nssc221.txt,"Two years after the divorce, the wife applied to vary the spousal support provisions of the parties' Corollary Relief Judgment, which incorporated the terms of Minutes of Settlement. Pursuant to the Corollary Relief judgment, the husband was currently paying the wife $4,350 per month as spousal support. The wife now wished to increase the monthly support to a figure which would more closely resemble that assessed pursuant to the Spousal Support Advisory Guidelines, along with a substantial lump sum to compensate her for the underpayment of spousal support for the past two years. She also sought removal of a clause which provided for the discontinuation of support if the husband's professional income dropped below $80,000. The parties had been married for approximately thirty years and had one child, who was now independent. Application dismissed; the parties' current circumstances did not constitute a significant departure from the range of reasonable outcomes anticipated by the parties when the Agreement was signed. Both parties' income had increased since the divorce and the wife was not deeply in debt, as she alleged; there was no pressure exerted and no oppression during the course of negotiations; the Spousal Support Advisory Guidelines are not law and allow for exceptions to the general formulas provided, one such exception being the assumption of debt by one of the parties (the husband in this case); the spousal support figure recognized the husband's reasonable expectation of retirement and the fact that he was experiencing health problems; it was completely foreseeable at the time that the Agreement was signed that, given the wife's age, she might experience difficulty in finding employment in her narrow field; the subsequent increased value of one of the husband's properties was not a reason to vary the spousal support provisions of the Agreement.","The applicant applied to vary spousal support provisions of the Corollary Relief Judgment dated February 20th, 2003.

There was no pressure exerted upon the applicant and no oppression during the course of the negotiations or the signing of the Agreement and there was no evidence of coersion or anything of that nature. The additional income came from investment income and rental income that she received from a tenant who rents a basement apartment in her home as well as rent from boarder. The household expenses that the applicant claimed in relation to her rental income exceeded the actual rental income and there were no adverse tax consequences to receiving those monies. 2)The agreement was not in substantial compliance with the objectives of the Divorce Act. 3)It was not necessary for the court to determine the agreement was unconscionable. The court is to look at all of the evidence and determine whether one party took advantage of the vulnerability of another party in the negotiations. 4)The parties had signed an agreement in January 2003 that provided for an approximately equal division of matrimonial assets and debts.

The evidence of a psychiatrist who assessed the respondent as having a high threshold for the ability to instruct counsel derogates from the fundamental principle that an accused is entitled to choice his own self-defence.

He was also charged with two indictable offences: two counts of breach of bail conditions and one count of obstruction of a peace officer by providing false name. 5) The Court concludes that the evidence of the Crown and the parties that the appellant is incapable of instructing counsel as he does not have the capacity to interpret the evidence and to present a rational decision. The evidence of a psychiatrist who assessed the respondent as having a high threshold for the ability to instruct counsel derogates from the fundamental principle that an accused is entitled to choice his own self-defence. The psychiatrist concluded that he would therefore be unable to instruct in a manner that would be in his best interests and that he, in fact, resist the assistance of counsel altogether.

[1] This is an appeal by the Crown from an order of a Provincial Court Judge declaring that the respondent is unfit to stand trial.

CONCLUSION [34] This is not a case where a conditional sentence served in the community is available or appropriate. [38] In all of these circumstances, the court has concluded that an appropriate sentence to be imposed upon S.C., for his conduct in this case, is a term of imprisonment of nine months to be served in a correctional institute of Canada.

As the contract was with the Crown, and the Act is not binding on the Crown, the general contractor was not obliged to pay anything to the plaintiff. Therefore, the supplier was not entitled to recover against the surety under the Bond.","After a sub-contractor failed to complete its contract work, a supplier of materials to the subcontractor sued the general contractor and the surety under the terms of a Labour and Material Payment Bond for payment of a balance owing to it by the sub contractor. The contract stipulated that if the Act applied, the contractor would be required to pay directly to suppliers and labourers for All Ports, unless some other party had a prior claim to the holdback fund. In the absence of a contract, the supplier would not have been entitled to recover anything due to the third party statutory liens. The supplier's claim was dismissed. HELD: 1)The mechanics' lien Act does not apply to this contract or this work. 2)If the Mechanics' Lien Act had applied it would have been applicable less the requirement of a holdback of 10% of the value of the work, services and materials actually done, placed or furnished. 3)The only authority cited with respect to the purpose and effect of Clause 4 (4) of the Bond is Johnson Controls Ltd. et al. (1996), 157 N.S.R. (2d) 350 (S.C.A.D.) which considered provision of a Bond identical to that considered in Davison, J. held that there was no priority in the particular circumstances and, therefore, costs ought not be awarded against it. 4)The letter from London Guarantee to Hazmasters was not a promise to pay as it contained no words of explicit promise. It was submitted on behalf of Hazmasters that the handwritten note contained no such words as explicit promise and that it desisted from immediately pusuing its rights under the Bond constituted sufficient consideration to support the claim to pay.","After a sub-contractor failed to complete its contract work, a supplier of materials to the sub-contractor sued the general contractor and the surety under the terms of a Labour and Material Payment Bond for payment of a balance owing to it by the sub-contractor. However, I find no intention to contract, no valuable consideration, and no promise to pay. Paragraph 4 of the Labour & Material Payment Bond limits the liability of the surety and the principal to make payment to a claimant such as Hazmasters not having a contract directly with the principal. Liability is limited to the amount which the Principal would have been obliged to pay to the claimant if the provisions of the Mechanics\' Lien Act, R.S.N.S. 1989, c.277, applied to the work. The Mechanics\' Lien Act does not expressly state that it binds the Crown. In the result, if the Mechanics\' Lien Act had been applicable, Hazmasters would not have been entitled to recover anything due to the third party statutory liens. The claims of Hazmasters against Rideau Construction and London Guarantee are both dismissed.",0.35368421052631577,"After a subcontractor failed to complete its contract work, a supplier of materials to the sub-contractor sued the general contractor and the surety under the terms of a Labour and Material Payment Bond for payment of a balance owing to it by the sub contractor.

The plaintiffs sued because their freezer failed and meat spoiled after a circuit breaker at the business tripped off. The defendant had received no alarm. The plaintiff asserts that the defendant breached the contract by failing to properly monitor the temperature in the freezer.

The Court was satisfied that the defendant was monitoring the signal from the plaintiff's business on the dates in question and no alarm was received.

That monitoring is done by the Gardon staff in Yorkton, based on information transmitted by the monitoring equipment over a telephone line from the business.

HELD: The action was dismissed. There will be no order as to costs. 1) Based on the original contract between the parties (Exhibit P-1), and ongoing payments being made in 2010, the onus was on the defendant to prove on a reasonable basis that the breach of the contract was within their control. It is possible that there was a so-called glitch in the monitoring system that resulted in no alarm being received by them on August 14, 2010 and no request for repair was ever received from this business after this incident; and the detailed computer records, which are unalterable, and the nature of the computer back-up system at Gardon, ensure that there is no breach of their contractual obligation. 2) The monitoring equipment was installed in the cooler and freezer of the business in January 2006 for the sum of $1,190.26 and was monitored by the plaintiff in the months leading up to that day.

e_2013skqb264.txt,"The parties had three children during their marriage. After the marriage ended in 1988, the husband respondent, medical specialist, moved from Moose Jaw to Ontario where his annual income was about $175,000. The children stayed with the petitioner wife in Moose Jaw. She was not able to work as registered nurse until she upgraded her education, which she slowly did as she could afford it. She and the children lived on very little income and relied upon social assistance because the respondent often did not pay child support. The parties were regularly in court. In 1994, the respondent left his position in Ontario and moved to Milwaukee, believing his prospects were better in the U.S. However, he lost his position in Milwaukee and opened his own clinic. His income dropped to as little as $15,000 in 2001. In this application, the respondent applied to vary two support orders, one made in 1998 and the other issued in 2001. He sought to expunge the arrears in respect of each and a declaration that the three children are no longer children of the marriage. His reason for seeking to have the arrears expunged was because he, now 72, wanted to retire in the next couple of years. The petitioner, 63, deeply in debt and on long-term disability, was still caring for one of their children because he suffers from schizophrenia. HELD: The Court held that two of the children had ceased to be children of the marriage as of 2002 and 2008 respectively. With respect to the third child, the Court found that as a result of the serious and long-term mental health problems suffered by him, he remained a child of the marriage. The Court then found that the respondent's arrears in respect of the 1998 child support order were $7,000. Based upon the respondent's imputed income of $109,000 per year established by the Court in its 2001 order, and the dates upon which the two children ceased to be so under the Divorce Act, the Court calculated the amount of child support owed by the respondent at $186,300. The Court rejected the respondent's argument that he could not afford to pay the arrears because his expenses left him with an income surplus of only $13,000. The Court discounted most of the claimed expenses and found that the respondent had $58,000 at his disposal and therefore had the ability to pay his arrears. The Court found that the respondent had chosen to minimize his earning capacity by staying in the U.S. in private practice and thus the respondent could not assert that the Court should use his actual income rather than his imputed income to vary the amount of child support he was ordered to pay in 2001. The undue hardship that the petitioner had suffered for 25 years constituted the most compelling reason for the Court to refuse to reduce or expunge the respondent's arrears.

Almost every dollar that was taken from the respondent by garnishment process or the interception of federal government monies directed to him was snatched away from him.","3) The respondent seeks to vary two orders, one that was issued in 1998 and the other that was issued in 2001.

The respondent had not been paying child support for some time and, in some cases, had to resort to welfare to provide for the children. 4) There were no special circumstances on which the respondent could have taken employment that paid him $110,000 a year. He knew that he was expected to maximize his earning capacity but simply chose not to. 5) The petitioner was not able to work as a registered nurse. She was on long-term disability and could not put her children into extracurricular activities. She continued to care for the petitioner, who had serious psychotic illness and was dependent on her for the rest of her life.","3) The respondent seeks to vary two orders, one that was issued in 1998 and the other that was issued in 2001. He wants to expunge the arrears in respect of each and also seeks a declaration that their three children are no longer children of the marriage. I do not accept that assertion. Thabani suffers from a serious psychotic illness and has lived with the petitioner continuously. 22) In summary, I find that Mandela ceased to be a child of the marriage on June 30, 2002 and Bogani ceased being a child of the marriage on June 30, 2008 (June 30 being the approximate date of the end of the school year). Thabani continues to be a child of the marriage. 26) The arrears under the 1998 order are $7,008 and the arrears under the 2001 order are $176,738 ($186,300 - $9,562). 33) Considering the above, I cannot find that the respondent does not have the ability to pay the arrears, which I have calculated to be $183,746. 1. The respondent’s application to reduce or expunge child support arrears is dismissed. 2. As of April 30, 2013, the respondent’s arrears under the orders of Madam Justice Wilkinson dated March 7, 2001 and July 20, 1998 are fixed at $183,746. 4. The child Thabani remains a child of the marriage. 5. Commencing June 1, 2013 and continuing on the first day of each month thereafter until further order of the Court, the respondent shall pay basic child support in the amount of $927 per month.",0.18737270875763745,"FIAT. The respondent sought to vary two orders issued in 1998 and 2001 to expunge child support arrears that had accumulated as a result of his not paying child support for many years. HELD: The application was dismissed. The court found that the respondent did not have the ability to pay child support and that, in the absence of a special circumstance, arrear arreages should only be expunged where the payee has established on a balance of probabilities that he or she cannot pay the child support payable in the amount of $9,000.  1) The respondent was ordered to pay $1,683 in basic child support, $249 per month in s. expenses and $2,589 in child support costs. 2) There was no undue hardship to the parties as the respondent was putting money away for his retirement. Almost every dollar that was taken from the respondent by garnishment process or the interception of federal government monies directed to him was snatched away from him.",0.17758369723435224

Although the professor had not taken the content of the attachment as threat, he had sent it on to university officials as he had been requested to alert them to any odd or unusual behaviour by the student. The student later advised the professor that he had typed the messages because he thought someone was monitoring what he was typing and he was trying to get reaction out of them. He also testified that he had not intended to send that particular attachment to the professor. Appeal allowed; conviction quashed. The trial judge erred in permitting inadmissible evidence to be adduced from the university administration to the effect that the accused had a psychiatric illness and, in failing to intervene when the Crown assumed that the student had put his character in issue and cross-examined him as to alleged prior acts of misconduct and other extraneous matters, the cumulative effect of which was fatal to the trial judge's findings of credibility.

He sent an email to his computer science professor with an attachment. Although the professor did not take the content of the attachment as a threat, he sent it to university officials as he had been requested to alert them to any odd or unusual behaviour by the appellant. The police were contacted and a charge was laid against the appellant of uttering a threat to the professor to cause his death contrary to s.264.1(1)(a) of the Criminal Code.

A stay of proceedings was ruled out. The accused was not permitted to give evidence in this trial. The court found that requiring another lawyer to step in to cross-examine the witness would not be appropriate. The examination-in-chief would have had to take over the case entirely in order be sure to protect the interests of both the accused and the defence.",0.3138461538461539

e_2012skpc161.txt,"The accused plead guilty to one count of aggravated assault, a breach of undertaking for failure to keep the peace and be of good behaviour and failing to comply with a condition of a youth sentence by failing to report to his youth worker. The victim came out of his house because he was concerned that someone was trying to damage his vehicle. The victim had baseball bat when he confronted the accused and group of young people. One of the accused's friends was pushed and fell backwards hitting his head. The accused said the victim hit him on the back with the bat. The accused got the bat and hit the victim five times in the head. The accused and another youth also kicked the victim while he was down. After the assault, the accused and his friends fled, leaving the victim in the alley. The victim suffered serious injuries including shattered jaw, every bone in his face was broken, his skull was fractured and he suffered brain bleed and lost teeth. He is also going to lose his eye, has memory loss and had to sell his business because he cannot work. The Crown applied to have the offence declared a serious violent offence and sought a sentence of 24 months, being 16 months secure custody followed by 8 months community supervision. At the time of the offence the accused was 17 years and months of age. He identified as Metis youth, but had no connection to cultural activities and claimed he had not been subjected to racism or poverty. His parents were separated. He was not attending school or working at the time of the offence. He had an extensive criminal record including 17 entries for compliance related convictions, previous property related convictions, for obstructing police offences and one for uttering threats. He had served five open custody sentences. HELD: The offence was declared a serious violent offence. The victim will be significantly and permanently disabled as a result of the offence and there can be no doubt that the accused caused intentional and grievous bodily harm to the victim. The court held that the egregious nature of the assault, serious harm done to the victim and the fact that the youth was subject to release conditions with respect to a weapons offence at the time he committed the assault were aggravating factors. In mitigation, the accused had entered a guilty plea, was cooperative with the police investigation, had done well in pre-sentence detention and had expressed remorse for his actions by submitting an apology letter to the court. The accused was sentenced to 24 months secure custody followed by 18 months probation. He was given 2:1 credit for the time he was on remand, leaving 18 months custody of closed custody to serve of which 12 months would be actual custody and 6 months would be community supervision. The court held that a lengthy custodial sentence was necessary to provide meaningful consequences and to achieve meaningful progress for the accused. A period of secure custody and supervision would give the accused access to psychological counselling and programming, an opportunity to work on his education and a chance to engage with support services in the community prior to release from custody.

HELD: The accused was sentenced to a secure custodial sentence of 24 months to be followed by a period of probation with credit for pre-sentence detention on the basis of two days for each day spent in detention. The accused will be permanently disabled as a result of the assault. 1)The accused was cooperative with police and provided a statement. While in detention, he remained in detention while three reports were prepared and his family was fearful and will continue to suffer. 2)The young person did not oppose the Crown's application. He expressed remorse in light of comments made at a show cause hearing to the effect that he wished he would have killed the victim. The Crown disagrees but is not in a position to take issue with the accused's allegation. 3)A period of custody is necessary to provide meaningful consequences and to achieve meaningful progress for the accused.

[21] In these circumstances, and given the young person did not oppose the Crown’s application, I find this was a serious violent offence and I designate it as such, pursuant to s. 42(9) of the YCJA.

In issue was whether the assessor erred in law by misconstruing or misapplying the provisions of the Assessment Manual in determining the MAF for the appellant's shopping centre properties by using a single sale to calculate the MAF; and by creating as a commercial building neighbourhood the grouping of fully enclosed shopping centres which encompassed the entire city.

The City applied for a review. HELD: The City's application was allowed. Under the terms of the collective agreement in force, the employee was actually paid 4 hours pay in excess of the Act's requirements for each of the weeks in question. Pursuant to section 72 of the Act, therefore, these particular terms of the collective agreement applied since they were, when considered in light of the balance of the agreement, more favorable to the employee than the requirements of the Act.","The City brought an application to review the assessment. The Director of the Labour Standards Branch of the Department of Labour issued a certificate pursuant to s. 60 of The Labour Standards Act, identifying that the City owed its transit employee $511.08 in wages. At the hearing, the Director filed a letter reducing the assessment to $318.41 (including annual holiday pay). The City brings this application to the City. By ss. 10(1) and 6(2) of the Act, an employer is required to pay an employee at the rate of time and one-halffor every hour worked in excess of 32 hours in any week which has a public holiday. The provisions of the agreement are more favourable to the employee than the Act. HELD: The City's application is allowed and the certificate is amended to show that there are no wages due orowing to Albert Morgan. There will be no order as to costs. 1)Nothing in this Act or in any order or regulation made under this Act affects any provision in any Act, agreement or contract of service or custom insofar as it ensures to any employee more favourable conditions, more favourable hours of work or more favourable rate of wages than the hours of labour provided for by the Act or by any other Order or regulation. The existence of the holiday is an essential part of the issue. No holiday means no issue. 2)The City filed various documents, including copies of the collective bargaining agreement (the ""agreement"") it has with the Amalgamated Transit Union, Local #588, which covers Morgan's employment with the City, and asked me to compare the agreement's holiday pay with the Act pay.

6_2000skqb355.txt,"FIAT. The applicants, charged separately, plead not guilty to cultivation and possession of marijuana and sought to have the evidence obtained pursuant to the authorizations for electronic surveillance and search warrant be excluded from trial and requested a stay of proceedings on all charges.  They argued the search warrant, which resulted in the seizure of 365 marijuana plants, should be set aside on the additional grounds police officers allowed two news media camera crews onto the premises to film during the course of the search thereby rendering the search unreasonable pursuant to s.8 of the Charter. The primary ground was that the police did not try any available investigative procedures before applying for a surveillance authorization. As the matter was not urgent s.186(1)(b) of the Criminal Code was not complied with. The Crown objected to the defences' reliance on portions of the preliminary inquiry. The Crown produced an edited copy of the affidavits in support of the electronic and video surveillance warrants wherein all dates and other information were deleted to protect the identity of a principal source of information. HELD: The application for a stay of proceedings was dismissed. The evidence obtained pursuant to the electronic surveillance and the video surveillance warrant were ruled inadmissible at trial. The search warrant respecting the residence was set aside. The seriousness of the charge combined with the real evidence of the 365 marijuana plants outweighed the breach of the Charter s.8 right to be secure from unreasonable search and seizure. The exclusion of the evidence obtained from the search of the premises would bring the administration of justice into disrepute. 1)The portions of the preliminary inquiry transcript were allowed by way of affidavit subject to the right of the Crown to call amplification evidence.  2)The affidavit in support of the authorizations were considered solely on the basis of the edited copies. 3)The affidavit did disclose a current offence. It was not obvious why the Crown edited out the dates. 4)The 1997 authorization was set aside. The search was unreasonable and in breach of s.8 of the Charter. The s.186(1)(b) pre-conditions for granting an authorization were not met. There was no information contained in the affidavit or the amplification evidence which could support an objective standard that other investigative procedures were unlikely to succeed. The impression given the issuing judge was false and misleading. The fact pattern was the reverse of that in Dosch. The information was limited to the existence of a marijuana grow operation on a rural acreage owned by Derksen with whom Begrand-Fast was alleged to be involved. Neither had a criminal record. The boilerplate paragraphs as to why other investigative procedures were unlikely to succeed had no factual basis.  5)The information submitted to establish reasonable and probable grounds was exclusively information obtained from the electronic surveillance authorization. A good faith argument was not available because the information submitted in support of the warrant was tainted by the conduct utilized to obtain the authorization. The evidence obtained was equally a product of a serious infringement of the applicant's s.8 Charter rights because once the tainted evidence was excised for the affidavit in support there was no evidence supporting the issuance of the warrant. The privacy interest was comparatively high. The nature of the constitutional breach was major. The means of obtaining the authorization was misleading because the reasons offered for not conducting a further investigation lacked a factual basis. 6)The residence search warrant was set aside. The affidavit provided no indication of the source of the informer's knowledge. The issuing justice was therefore unable to assess the reliability or the credibility of the information. The fact the source is credible does not mean the information provided is reliable. 7)The seriousness of the breach was not at the high end of the scale. There was an attempt to comply with the Criminal Code and two of the three requirements were met. While good faith was not found with respect to the information offered in support of the electronic authorization, there was nothing in the information presented with respect to the search warrant that lead to a conclusion of bad faith. On balance the administration of justice would not be brought into disrepute with the admissibility of this evidence.  8)The Criminal Code makes no provision to add the names of civilians to a search warrant. The reasoning in R. v. West applied and the search of the Derksen residence was conducted in an unreasonable manner contrary to s.8 of the Charter. A Collins analysis favoured the inclusion of the evidence including the plants. The police were attentive to privacy issues in supervising and restricting the television cameras. The officer set grounds rules that the residence could not be identified in any broadcast. The drug section was not the initiator of inviting the media along. It was coincidence that the corporal did so on a search where the warrant was subsequently held to be invalid. The two events did not amount to a course of conduct. 9)The improper seizure and retention of personal property of the accused was a collateral matter and did not affect the fairness of the trial.","FIAT: The applicants were charged with cultivating marijuana and possession of marihuana. They were scheduled for separate trials this fall before Judge and Jury. The Crown brought a Charter motion in advance of jury selection to set aside: (1) a section 186 CCC 60 day authorization for electronic surveillance directed at their residences and their cell phones; (2) a 9 day video surveillance authorization for the residence authorizing the observance of the applicant Begrand-Fast; and (3) a search warrant to search the applicant's residence which resulted in the seizure of 365 plants and led to the present charges. HELD: The application for leave to cross-examine was granted and the evidence obtained at the preliminary inquiry relevant to this application was admissible, subject to the right of the Crown to call amplification evidence. This should not be considered a usurpation of the trial judge's function. Cross-examination will disclose facts to the accused but they will only become admissible at trial by leave of the judge.","As is the practice in this jurisdiction, defence counsel have brought a Charter motion in advance of jury selection to set aside: (1) A section 186 CCC 60 day authorization for electronic surveillance on each accused dated January 30, 1997 primarily directed at their residences and their cell phones. (2) A section 487.01(4) 9 day video surveillance authorization dated March 19, 1997 for the residence of the applicant Derksen authorizing the observance of the applicant Begrand-Fast. (3) A search warrant to search the residence of the applicant Derksen dated April 1, 1997 which resulted in the seizure of 365 marihuana plants and led to the present charges. The applicants seek to have the evidence obtained pursuant to the authorizations and warrant excluded from trial, and state it is also an appropriate case to direct a stay of proceedings on all charges against both applicants. As a result, the boilerplate paragraphs offered on why other investigative procedures were unlikely to succeed had or have no factual basis. In the end result, the applicant’s have satisfied the burden of proof on the balance of probabilities that the pre-conditions for the granting of an authorization set out in s. 186(1)(b) were not met. As a result the authorization dated January 30, 1997 is set aside. [28] The interceptions which occurred pursuant to the authorization of January 30, 1997 constituted a search and seizure within the meaning of s. 8 of the Charter, and as the search was not authorized by law the search was unreasonable and in breach of that section (Vide: R. v. Garofoli, supra, per Sopinka J. at p. 187). The video surveillance warrant therefore must be set aside. A good faith argument is not available because the information submitted in support of the warrant was tainted by the conduct utilized to obtain the electronic surveillance authorization. The evidence obtained is equally a product of a serious infringement of the applicant’s s. 8 Charter rights because once the tainted evidence was excised from the affidavit in support there was no evidence supporting the issuance of the warrant. The means of obtaining the authorization was misleading because the reasons offered for not conducting a further investigation lacked a factual basis. I conclude it is more likely than not the administration of justice would be brought into disrepute. [44] The evidence obtained pursuant to the electronic surveillance authorization and the video surveillance warrant is ruled inadmissible at trial. One associate is a, who has also been in marihuana cultivation for years. [54] The absence of compellable detail of the alleged offence and the absence of the source of the informer’s knowledge means the information supplied for the Derksen search warrant did not provide a basis for the issuing justice of the peace to conclude reasonable and probable grounds existed for the issuance of the warrant, and the warrant must be set aside. [57] I do not consider the seriousness of the breach in this case to be at the high end of the scale. While good faith was not found with respect to the information offered in support of the electronic authorization, there is nothing in the information presented with respect to the search warrant that leads to a conclusion of bad faith in applying for the search warrant. As a result, on balance I conclude the administration of justice would not be brought into disrepute with the admissibility of this evidence. [67] In the end result, the seriousness of the charge combined with the real evidence of the marihuana plants obtained, which is crucial to any successful prosecution of Mr. Derksen, outweighs the breach of his s. 8 Charter rights to be secure from unreasonable search and seizure. I conclude it is more likely than not that exclusion of the evidence obtained from the search of his premises would bring the administration of justice into disrepute.

(2) A section 487.01(4) 9 day video surveillance authorization dated March 19, 1997 for the residence of the applicant Derksen authorizing the observance of the applicant Begrand-Fast. (3) A search warrant to search the residence of the applicant Derksen dated April 1, 1997 which resulted in the seizure of 365 marihuana plants and led to the present charges. The applicants seek to have the evidence obtained pursuant to the authorizations and warrant excluded from trial, and state it is also an appropriate case to direct a stay of proceedings on all charges against both applicants. As a result, the boilerplate paragraphs offered on why other investigative procedures were unlikely to succeed had or have no factual basis. In the end result, the applicant’s have satisfied the burden of proof on the balance of probabilities that the pre-conditions for the granting of an authorization set out in s. 186(1)(b) were not met. As a result the authorization dated January 30, 1997 is set aside. [28] The interceptions which occurred pursuant to the authorization of January 30, 1997 constituted a search and seizure within the meaning of s. 8 of the Charter, and as the search was not authorized by law the search was unreasonable and in breach of that section (Vide: R. v. Garofoli, supra, per Sopinka J. at p. 187). The video surveillance warrant therefore must be set aside. A good faith argument is not available because the information submitted in support of the warrant was tainted by the conduct utilized to obtain the electronic surveillance authorization. The evidence obtained is equally a product of a serious infringement of the applicant’s s. 8 Charter rights because once the tainted evidence was excised from the affidavit in support there was no evidence supporting the issuance of the warrant. The means of obtaining the authorization was misleading because the reasons offered for not conducting a further investigation lacked a factual basis. I conclude it is more likely than not the administration of justice would be brought into disrepute. [44] The evidence obtained pursuant to the electronic surveillance authorization and the video surveillance warrant is ruled inadmissible at trial. One associate is a, who has also been in marihuana cultivation for years. [54] The absence of compellable detail of the alleged offence and the absence of the source of the informer’s knowledge means the information supplied for the Derksen search warrant did not provide a basis for the issuing justice of the peace to conclude reasonable and probable grounds existed for the issuance of the warrant, and the warrant must be set aside. [57] I do not consider the seriousness of the breach in this case to be at the high end of the scale. While good faith was not found with respect to the information offered in support of the electronic authorization, there is nothing in the information presented with respect to the search warrant that leads to a conclusion of bad faith in applying for the search warrant. As a result, on balance I conclude the administration of justice would not be brought into disrepute with the admissibility of this evidence. [67] In the end result, the seriousness of the charge combined with the real evidence of the marihuana plants obtained, which is crucial to any successful prosecution of Mr. Derksen, outweighs the breach of his s. 8 Charter rights to be secure from unreasonable search and seizure. I conclude it is more likely than not that exclusion of the evidence obtained from the search of his premises would bring the administration of justice into disrepute. With respect to the improper seizure and retention of personal property of the accused, this is a collateral matter and does not affect the fairness of the trial. The application for a stay of proceedings is dismissed.",0.29874776386404295,"FIAT. The applicants were charged separately with cultivating marijuana and possession of marihuana. They were scheduled for separate trials this fall before Judge and Jury. As is the practice in this jurisdiction, defence brought a Charter motion in advance of jury selection to set aside two provisions of the authorization: a section 186 CCC 60 day authorization for electronic surveillance directed at their residences and their cell phones and a 9 day video surveillance authorization authorizing the observance of the applicant Begrand-Fast. A search warrant to search the applicant's residence in April 1997 which resulted in the seizure of 365 plants and led to the present charges. HELD: 1) Leave to cross-examine was granted. Leave should be left to the exercise of the discretion of the trial judge. 2) The authorization was set aside as information obtained from the electronic surveillance was utilized in obtaining the video surveillance warrant and the subsequent search warrant both of these warrants should be set aside on the basis they are derivative of the electronic authorization which is alleged to be unlawful. 3) The applicant sought to have the evidence obtained pursuant to the authorizations and warrants and a stay of proceedings excluded from trial. 4) The Crown did not err in arguing that evidence tendered at preliminary inquiry should not be used as trial evidence in order to prevent an abuse of what is essentially a ruling on the admissibility of evidence. Given the 1993 amendments to s. 187 of the Code, there is no reason that the granting of leave to cross examine should be the preserve of the court judge. The fact that the applicant did not consider this possible is a strong directive to that end. 5) The use of an undercover police officer or police agent is not the general rule. Cross-examination will disclose facts to the accused but they will only become admissible at trial by leave of the judge. R. v. West (1998), 12 C.R. (5th) 106.

The plea was based on the allegation that the parties had settled their differences in October, 1988, as a result of negotiations between the solicitors then representing the parties.

The evidence showed the plaintiffs had taken three years to reply to a demand for particulars. There was also delay when the defendant requested a change in the plaintiff's counsel (because of a conflict of interest). The defendant applied to dismiss the plaintiffs' action, claiming want of prosecution under the Rule 28.13 of the old Civil Procedure Rules (1972), and asserting it has suffered significant prejudice as a result of the delay such that it will be impossible to properly defend the claim. Application dismissed. While there has been inordinate delay (eight-and-a-half-years) attributable to the plaintiffs, the defendant is also responsible for some of the delay (another two-and-a-half-years). While the plaintiff's delay could be considered inexcusable if viewed in isolation, the defendant's contribution to the delay is not irrelevant. There were actions on the part of the defendant that could be interpreted as acquiescing to the delay.

He sought a declaration that a member of the police service must be informed of any investigation of his conduct prior to the commencement of the investigation as required by s.54 of the Police Act.; the Act does not permit the amendment in Form A discipline notice since it is a statutory form. The relief sought regarding disclosure had been abandoned by the applicant. The applicant argued that the fundamental questions to be addressed revolved around issues of statutory interpretation that must be resolved on a standard of correctness and the alternative remedies were not adequate. The respondent took the position that this Court should not entertain the application as there is a convenient alternative remedy provided in the Act by way of appeal to the provincial Police Commission; that the Chief was entitled to amend the notice and would be entitled to grant leave if required; the hearing officer erred in holding that s.54(1) of the Act requires notice of an internal investigation to be provided to the subject member.

In this case, the issue is whether the Crown and the defence have an obligation for disclosure in general terms in a slightly different fashion. The question is not whether the disclosure meshed with the particular lawyer's skills as opposed to general skills that all lawyers should have. In some cases, it would be by way of electronic disclosure or, in some situations, combination of the two. However, the choice is theirs, so long as the disclosure is reasonable accessible. The court is able to embark upon a Laporte inquiry and make the appropriate order, if any, regarding further disclosure, or should that issue be left to the trial judge. 3) The format of disclosure provided by the Crown in this case is appropriate. There are some 30,000 pages of disclosure made to the defence in addition to 275 audio files, 50 video files and large series of photos. The Crown does not object to the existence of hard copies. The issue that has arisen in other cases (R. v. Jonsson), [2001] W.W.R. 325, Klebuc J. (as he then was) stated: 'Whether production on computer diskettes or CD-ROM's is adequate will vary with the sophistication of the accused and his or her counsel's ability to access data stored thereon.' The court agreed that there was a day when the ability to operate personal computer and retrieve","The second is whether full disclosure that would allow the accused to provide a full answer and defence has been provided. In this case, given the nature of the charges, the number of police officers involved in the investigation leading up to the issuance of the warrants and the relative ease and cost of obtaining hard copies, the Crown should provide hard copies of the notes made by police officers in their notebooks. It is ordered that the notebooks of those officers who will be testifying at trial are to be provided to the defence in hard copy in chronological order.

The motion, made pursuant to s. 7, 11 and 24 of the Charter of Rights is for an order that the accused 'be provided with full disclosure in a useable format'. The motion has two components. The first relates to the method in which disclosure has been provided, the 'useable format'. The second is whether full disclosure that would allow the accused to provide a full answer and defence has been provided.  The second issue is to be dealt with by a 'Laporte inventory', name for the procedure in R. v. Laporte (1993), 113 Sask. R. 34 (C.A.).HELD: 1) There are some 30,000 to 40,000 pages of disclosure made to the defence. In addition, there are 275 audio file, 50 video files and a large series of photos. The defence seeks photocopies of all officers' notebooks organized by date and officer. The basis of the defence's argument is firstly, equality of use or a level playing field should be created with respect to the provision of documents used by the Crown and, secondly, trial fairness requires the particulars of the police officers' notes be provided in the format requested. The defence argues that if the Crown is going to be using paper copies of some documentation because it finds that use more convenient and effective, then the defence should be provide with the same paper copies to level the playing field. 2) The defence has candidly advised that the issue surrounding the defence of a serious drug charge usually starts with the validity of the search warrant, and the information used by the police in obtaining the search is crucial, not just the information that was provided to the official issuing the warrant but any information that may have been withheld. The affidavits in support of the search warrants in this case are easily found in the database, and cross- referencing to the police officers' notes in support of that information is available. What is not easily available and, for the purposes of the Crown, not relatively important is the balance of the information that may have been obtained by the officer not disclosed by affidavit. This information is often crucial for the defence. 3) In this case, given the nature of the charges, the number of police officers involved in the investigation leading up to the issuance of the warrants and cost of obtaining hard copies, the Crown should provide hard copies of the notes made by police officers in the notebooks. It is ordered that the notebooks of those officers who will be testifying at trial are to be provided to the defence in hard copy in chronological order. In all other respects, the nature and format of the disclosure provided to date is appropriate in that it has been provided in a reasonably accessible manner which does not detract from the right of the accused to make full answer and defence.  4) A useful discussion of electronic disclosure and the issues involved is found in R. v. Piaskowski, 2007 MBQB 68, in which the Court reviews extensively the use of electronic disclosure as opposed to paper disclosure.","The accused is facing a 24 count indictment generally associated with allegations of involvement in the sale of controlled substances and matters ancillary thereto.

The issues are whether full disclosure that would allow the accused to provide a full answer and defence has been provided. The second issue is to be dealt with by 'Laporte inventory'.

There is no need for the Crown to provide copies of any officers' notebooks in hard copy and chronological order that postdates the laying of the charges or the issuance of search warrants, whichever is dated later.

The Crown applied under s. 752.1(1) for an order remanding the accused for an assessment by an expert for use as evidence in an application to have the accused declared a dangerous offender. The defence opposed the application on the basis that the predicate offence was not a serious personal injury offence and it was not within the realm of possibility that the accused could be found to be a dangerous offender. The accused was 50 years old. He had a criminal record commencing in 1976 which included 58 Criminal Code convictions. Fifteen of his prior convictions were for violent offences and six related to police officers. He had violated mandatory supervision orders on three separate occasions and had breached a conditional sentence order. The crimes of violence on his record involved the use of a weapon on more then one occasion. The facts of the predicate offence involved swinging a branch at a police officer. The officer had tasered the accused, but it had no effect. The accused grabbed a branch and swung it in sufficient proximity to cause the officer to back up, drop his taser and draw his sidearm. The officer provided a victim impact statement outlining the fear he experienced and the psychological impact the offence had on himself and his family. HELD: The offence is a serious personal injury offence as defined in s. 752. The accused picked up the branch with the intention of using it against the officer and it was of sufficient size that if the accused had struck the officer it would have caused serious damage. The accused's actions were found to have endangered or been likely to endanger the officer's life or safety and to have inflicted or been likely to inflict severe psychological damage.

e_2006skqb508.txt,"The Crown appeals the decision of the Provincial Court judge that found the respondent's rights under s. 10(b) of the Charter has been violated and in excluding the certificate of analysis, acquitted the respondent. The Crown argues that the trial judge misapplied the reasoning of the Supreme Court in R. v. Prosper in his analysis of the circumstances surrounding the police officer's demand for the respondent to provide his breath sample. The issue on this appeal is whether Prosper requires the police in the Saskatchewan jurisdiction, where faced with a detainee that has changed his mind and declined legal advice, to inform that detainee that he has a right to a reasonable opportunity to contact a lawyer and that the police have an obligation not to require the detainee to participate in any incriminating process until the detainee has had a reasonable opportunity to contact a lawyer. HELD: 1) Prosper addresses the issue of the police's obligation in jurisdictions where free, preliminary legal advice is unavailable. Oppositely, Saskatchewan has Brydges duty counsel available to detainees and no such obligation exists. Having reviewed the law as stated in Prosper, the Court concluded that the trial judge erred in finding that this case was analogous to the facts in Prosper, and in finding that the police officer had an obligation to provide a 'Prosper warning' to the respondent once the respondent had changed his mind and declined legal advice. 2) The police in Saskatchewan are required to provide any detainee with information so that detainee may access that legal advice. Once the police are confronted with detainee who changes his mind and declines legal advice, this waiver must be clear and unequivocal. 3) The evidence falls far short of proving that the respondent was frustrated, impatient probably, but not frustrated. The exchange lasted about minutes. The evidence shows a detainee who chose to neither wait for the telephone line to be available nor to telephone a private lawyer.","The Crown appeals the decision of the learned Provincial Court judge that found the respondent's rights under s. 10(b) of the Charter of Rights and Freedoms had been violated and, in excluding the certificate of analyses, acquitted the respondent. The only evidence led in the voir dire at the trial was that of the police officer who stopped the respondent in a routine traffic stop of vehicles entering Saskatoon from the east. The police officer determined that he had reasonable and probable grounds to believe that the respondent was operating his motor vehicle while impaired, he arrested the respondent, read the respondent his right to retain counsel and gave the requisite police warning. The breathalyzer certificate was excluded. The Crown argued that the ratio decidendi in Prosper required Cst. Lerat to provide the respondent with an additional component of information once the respondent waived that right. HELD: 1) In reviewing the evidence that was before the learned trial judge, the judge could not have reasonably reached the conclusion he did. Not only does this case have no comparison to the facts in R. v. Prosper, the evidence falls far short of proving that respondent was frustrated. Impatient, probably, but not frustrated. The exchange lasted about 5 minutes. 2) An additional informational obligation on police will be triggered once a detainee, who has previously asserted the right to counsel, indicates that he has changed his mind and no longer wants legal advice. At this point, police are required to tell the detainee of his rights to reasonable opportunity to contact a lawyer and of the obligation on the part of police during this time to refrain from having them participate in any process that would incriminate him. 3) The holding-off requirement flows logically from the two implementation duties. The trial judge concluded such a warning was required in this case and none was given to the respondent by Cst Lerat. That being so, the trial judge found a breach of the respondent’s rights under the Charter. 4) The Court must examine the evidence to determine whether the Crown had met the burden of establishing the respondent gave an unequivocal waiver when he changed mind about seeking legal counsel. 5) The lack of a Prosper warning does not mean that the Crown has not been advised of the existence and availability of the applicable systems of duty counsel and Legal Aid in that jurisdiction. The evidence shows a detainee who chose to neither wait for the telephone line to be available nor to telephone a private lawyer.","[1] The Crown appeals the decision of the learned Provincial Court judge that found the respondent’s rights under s. 10 (b) of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms had been violated and, in excluding the certificate of analyses, acquitted the respondent.

b_2016skqb297.txt,"HELD: The court found that both parties were significantly involved in the day-to-day parenting of the children such that a conclusion that one parent or the other was the primary caregiver could not be made. The court also found that the respondent responded positively and appropriately to the petitioner’s concerns regarding masturbation and pornography. The respondent indicated that he had not watched pornography since December 2014 and that software on his cell phone and computer provide assurances that he had not watched pornography to the petitioner. The petitioner did not dispute that evidence. The court could not reasonably give weight to the petitioner’s opinion evidence regarding the respondent’s alleged addictions. The court listed numerous problems with the petitioner’s evidence of addiction. The court was unable to conclude that there was a risk of harm to the children caused by the respondent. With respect to the petitioner’s allegation of the respondent’s anger management problem, most of the incidents were dated. The respondent had since taken anger management counselling, accepted that he suffers from ADD, and began taking medication for ADD. The court held that it was in the best interests of the children to continue to reside in the family home and that it would not be in their best interests for one parent to be classified as or be the primary parent. It was also in the children’s best interests that their parenting be shared on an equal basis. A nesting arrangement was found to be in the best interests of the children. The court ordered that the parties would have joint custody of the children and each party had exclusive possession of the family home when they were enjoying their assigned periods of parenting. The parents would alternate weeks living in the family home with the children.","FIAT: The petitioner’s application seeks orders granting her exclusive possession of the family home, primary residence of the children and supervised access only for the respondent father. Although no reasons were given on the granting of the interim exclusive possession order, the petitioner sought continuation of the order and supervised daytime access. The respondent takes the position that this order should not have been granted in the circumstances of this case. HELD: 1) The best interests of the child is not simply the right to be free of demonstrable harm. However, if the allegations are based on speculation, conjecture, suspicion or unreliable testimony and evidence, then the court should reject them. Any other approach invites abuse. 2) The court was unable to conclude from the evidence that there was anything to be taken from this incident that demonstrates any improper behaviour on the part of the respondent. The evidence before the court was that the respondent was significantly involved in his daughters’ lives, well beyond the level of many or most fathers who have normal work commitments.","[1] The petitioner’s application seeks orders granting her exclusive possession of the family home, primary residence of the children and supervised access only for the respondent father. He seeks to have the exclusive possession order terminated and an order providing for shared parenting of the children. Rather it is opinion evidence that she is not entitled to give and to which I cannot reasonably give weight. After considering all of the evidence I am unable to conclude there is a risk of harm. I conclude that the petitioner’s stated concerns of fear of the respondent to such a degree that he should be excluded from the family home or that put the children at risk of harm are not supported by the evidence and are unreasonable. [46] Based upon their respective past parenting activities I am satisfied that it would not be in the children’s best interests for one parent to be classified as or be the primary parent. The principle of maximum contact is particularly applicable and workable in the circumstances of this case and I am satisfied that it is, at this time and in the present circumstances, in the best interests of the children that their parenting be shared on an equal basis. [49] In the circumstances I have concluded that on an interim basis the best interests of the children are best served by a parenting regime sometimes called a nesting arrangement.

The without notice order of August 18 granting the petitioner exclusive possession of the family home is terminated effective as of the time that so ordered in open court on September 2, 2016; b.

It was also in the children’s best interests that their parenting be shared on an equal basis. A nesting arrangement was found to be in the best interests of the children. The court ordered that the parties would have joint custody of the children and each party had exclusive possession of the family home when they were enjoying their assigned periods of parenting. The parents would alternate weeks living in the family home with the children.","HELD: The Court granted the petitioner exclusive possession of the family home, primary residence of the children and supervised access only for the respondent father. Although no reasons were given on the granting of the interim exclusive possession order, the petitioner raised concerns that the respondent had anger management problems that made her and their children fearful of him and addictions to pornography and masturbation that made it impossible for them to continue to reside in the same home. The respondent took the position that the petitioner's allegations of sexual abuse were based upon speculation, conjecture, suspicion or unreliable testimony and evidence, which the Court could not reasonably attribute to the respondent. The Court found with respect to the totality of the evidence that: 1) the respondent was significantly involved in his children's lives, well beyond the level of many or most fathers who have normal work commitments; 2) the petitioner was entirely entitled to rebut the presumption that increased contact between the parties would in fact be beneficial. The evidence supported the conclusion the respondent would not be able to support such an application given the circumstances; and 3) that there was an artificial set of circumstances that would militate against the fostering of a proper post-separation relationship. The petitioner's grounds for so applying stated that he was scratching not masturbating and that he had been unable to avoid contact with the children for the past two years. The father had previously been diagnosed as being addicted to pornography, but now denied having ever masturbated in the presence of his children; and 4) that his anger management issues had made it difficult for him to put the children to bed with the exception of brief periods of uninterrupted daytime access. The court concluded that the evidence did not support the respondent's conclusion that he would be unable to protect the children from the risk associated with unsupervised access. Therefore, the Court refused to impose a minimum supervision access order on the father.","[1] The petitioner’s application seeks orders granting her exclusive possession of the family home, primary residence of the children and supervised access only for the respondent father.

The court also found that the respondent responded positively and appropriately to the petitioner’s concerns regarding masturbation and pornography. The respondent indicated that he had not watched pornography since December 2014 and that software on his cell phone and computer provide assurances that he had not watched pornography to the petitioner. The petitioner did not dispute that evidence. The court could not reasonably give weight to the petitioner’s opinion evidence regarding the respondent’s alleged addictions. The court listed numerous problems with the petitioner’s evidence of addiction. The court was unable to conclude that there was a risk of harm to the children caused by the respondent.

6_2009skqb394.txt,"The plaintiff bought a house. She used the services of Cecilia Mui, a realtor associated with the defendant 100% Realty Associates Ltd. operating as Re/max Saskatoon. The house was purchased from the defendants Edward and Verl Karpinski. The vendors' realtor was the defendant, Mario Jacobucci, owner of the defendant Trevi Holdings Ltd. The house did not meet the plaintiff's expectations. She now sues the defendants seeking recovery of damages for alleged latent defects. She claims Ms. Mui fell below the standard of care required of a realtor representing a purchaser. She claims Ms. Mui was negligent in misrepresenting certain facts and breached the fiduciary duty expected of her. The plaintiff claims the Karpinskis misrepresented facts to her, negligently and fraudulently. The plaintiff claims that Mr. Jacobucci and his company are liable to her in damages, both in negligence and as parties to the misrepresentations made by the vendors. Special and general damages are claimed as are aggravated damages and punitive damages. The trial took place over 22 days, spanning several years and included testimony from 14 witnesses. Two main issues are raised. The first is the liability of each of the defendants. The second issue is quantum of damages. The credibility of the parties is at the forefront of the determination of the issues. HELD: The vendors are liable to the plaintiff for breach of contract. Each of the defendants is a tortfeasor, each having breached an obligation or duty owed to the plaintiff, whether through negligence or misrepresentation. Their wrongful acts and omissions all contributed to the same damage. In that respect their liability is concurrent. The liability of the vendors and Mr. Jacobucci is joint, and that of Ms. Mui is several. As concurrent torfeasors, the fault for the damage shall be apportioned equally among the four of them.  1) Credibility is not a science, see R. v. Gagnon, 2006 SCC 17. It is not always possible to articulate with precision the complex intermingling of impressions that emerge after watching and listening to witnesses and attempting to reconcile the various versions of events. The principles and tools to be used in assessing credibility are summarized in Novak Estate (Re), 2008 NSSC 283. 2) Certain of the evidence of the Karpinskis and Ms. Mui is so unreliable that the whole of their evidence is cast with doubt. 3) The opinions and conclusions of Mr. Loraas and Mr. Epp are accepted by the court. They are professionals with no interest in the outcome of the action. Their evidence was largely unchallenged. The Court finds that the pine shakes were rotten, sealant had been applied to the shakes on at least two occasions and prior to the plaintiff offering to buy the property, the shakes were not properly installed allowing water to seep into the house, the skylight leaked and caulking had been applied to stop the leaking before the plaintiff offered to buy the house, there was improper and inadequate venting which resulted in moisture damage to the interior of the house and mold in the attic, the moisture damage in the house included damage to drywall and paint blisters. Nail pops throughout the house were largely the result of the house being moved. No inspection was done after the house was moved. 4) The Court finds the Karpinskis did not speak truthfully or completely when they answered the questions in the Property Condition Disclosure Statement (PCDS). The Court does not accept that the vendors were not aware of water and moisture damage arising from the improperly installed shingles, the missing ridge caps, the leaking skylight or the lack of venting. The sealant on the roof was sufficiently old to predate the plaintiff's purchase of the house. The vendors repaired the sink holes and moisture pockets and effectively concealed the problems. It should have been disclosed. Although the vendors denied knowing of the structural damage to their house, they knew the house had been cut in half and moved 300 kilometers and had sustained damage. The structural problems were concealed by the vendors through repairs to the dry wall, reinforcement at stress points, and repainting and patching of wall paper. The fact that the house had been cut in half and moved should have been disclosed on the PCDS. 5) It is not only current defects or ongoing problems that need to be disclosed on a PCDS. A prospective purchaser does not look to the PCDS only to ascertain that the roof is not leaking on the day it was signed, see Kaufmann v. Gibson, [2007] O.J. No. 2711 (Ont. S.C.) (QL). The Karpinskis are liable to the plaintiff for breach of contract for failing to disclose the existence of structural defects, damage due to water and roof leakage. The terms of the PCDS formed part of the agreement between the parties and the deliberate withholding of this information amounted to a false representation as to the condition of the home. With respect to damage arising from these defects, the doctrine of caveat emptor does not apply. 6) The requirements for negligent misrepresentation have been established by the plaintiff. The failure to disclose, or silence as to a known defect, amounts to an act of concealment of a material fact and has the same effect as an express misrepresentation and is sufficient to attract liability, Thomas v. Blackwell, 1999 SKQB 168. 7) The false representations knowingly made by the vendors and their silence as to material facts were fraudulent. 8) Ms. Mui was negligent and her conduct and advice to the plaintiff fell below the standard of care expected of a realtor acting for the purchaser of a rural property in 1999. She did not conduct any preliminary background checks with the Rural Municipality, which would include determining if proper permits had been obtained, prior to the plaintiff's offer to purchase. Ms. Mui did nothing more than merely mention a home inspection to the plaintiff on one occasion. At no time did she recommend a home inspection even after she knew the house had been moved and before the condition regarding a satisfactory PCDS was removed. Another reason to strongly recommend a home inspection would be in circumstances where the realtor knew that a rural municipality did not require building inspections and Ms. Mui knew this to be the case. The plaintiff relied on the representation of Ms. Mui to her detriment. Had Ms. Mui disclosed all material facts to the plaintiff and explained and recommended a home inspection, the Court is satisfied that the outcome for the plaintiff would have been different. Knowing the house had been moved and had not been inspected the plaintiff would have most likely reconsidered her decision to purchase. 9) The Court is satisfied that Mr. Jacabucci is liable to the plaintiff for negligent misrepresentation. He represented that the home was of 'quality construction'. This was incorrect. Mr. Jacobucci was also complicit in, and party to, the negligent misrepresentations made by the vendors in the PCDS. He knew the house had been moved and sustained damage. He also knew the skylight leaked. The plaintiff relied on these misrepresentations and damages resulted.  10) The costs incurred by the plaintiff to repair the house total $17,613. She is awarded $15,000 as compensation for personal time and effort that she expended in repairing the home. There is no evidence that the distress the plaintiff experienced constituted a physical injury, or a recognized psychiatric illness and she cannot be compensated for mental distress, whether under tort or breach of contract. She is awarded $10,000 for aggravated damages. Her claim for punitive damages is dismissed. Her claim for solicitor and client costs is dismissed. Corrigendum received dated December 3, 2009 and added to fulltext.","The plaintiff decided to purchase a home. She engaged the services of the defendant, Cecilia Mui, realtor associated with the defendant 100% Realty Associates Ltd. After a lengthy search house was purchased the following year, the plaintiff purchased the property. The property did not meet the plaintiff's expectations. The plaintiff sued the defendants seeking recovery of damages for alleged latent defects in the house. HELD: The plaintiff sues the defendants. 1) The property was not within her means. The realtor was negligent in misrepresenting certain facts and breached the fiduciary duty expected of her. 2) The plaintiff was not the only one experiencing problems with her home. The defendant's realtor also misrepresented facts to her, negligently and fraudulently, both in information given to her which induced her, in part, to purchase the home and in answers that she gave in a Property Condition Disclosure Statement (PCDS) which formed a condition of the contract for sale. They failed to tell her the home had been moved over 300 kilometres from its original building site. In so doing, it is alleged by the plaintiff that they breached the terms of the PCDS.","She now sues the defendants seeking recovery of damages for alleged latent defects in the house. She says that Ms. Mui and RE/MAX Saskatoon fell below the standard of care required of a realtor representing the purchaser of a residential property.

I have, accordingly, accepted the observations of Mr. Loraas and the opinions of Mr. Epp. 123) In considering the liability of each of the defendants I have, as previously noted, accepted the conclusions and opinions of Mr. Loraas and Mr. Epp. In particular, I find:
(i) The pine shakes were rotting and many were cracked to such an extent that water could permeate the underlying joints and decking. 130) In this case, I have concluded that Mr. and Mrs. Karpinski did not speak “truthfully and completely” when answering all the questions in the PCDS. However, given their lack of veracity on key issues, I do not accept that they were unaware of other water and moisture damage, whether arising from the improperly installed shingles, the missing ridge caps, the leaking skylight or inadequate venting that was occurring elsewhere in the interior of the house. Accordingly I find Mr. and Mrs. Karpinski liable to Ms. Schira for breach of contract for failing to disclose in questions B, F and G of the PCDS the existence of structural defects, damage due to water, and roof leakage.

Further, had Ms. Mui fulfilled her obligation first to disclose all material facts to Ms. Schira, and second, to explain and, in these circumstances, recommend a home inspection, I am satisfied on a balance of probabilities that the outcome for Ms. Schira would have been different. 148) I am satisfied however that Mr. Jacobucci is liable to Ms. Schira for negligent misrepresentation.

She used the services of Cecilia Mui, a realtor associated with the defendant 100% Realty Associates Ltd. operating as Re/max Saskatoon. The house was purchased from the defendants Edward and Verl Karpinski. The vendors' realtor was the defendant, Mario Jacobucci, owner of the defendant Trevi Holdings Ltd. The house did not meet the plaintiff's expectations. She now sues the defendants seeking recovery of damages for alleged latent defects. She claims Ms. Mui fell below the standard of care required of a realtor representing a purchaser. She claims Ms. Mui was negligent in misrepresenting certain facts and breached the fiduciary duty expected of her. The plaintiff claims the Karpinskis misrepresented facts to her, negligently and fraudulently. The plaintiff claims that Mr. Jacobucci and his company are liable to her in damages, both in negligence and as parties to the misrepresentations made by the vendors. Special and general damages are claimed as are aggravated damages and punitive damages. The trial took place over 22 days, spanning several years and included testimony from 14 witnesses. Two main issues are raised. The first is the liability of each of the defendants. The second issue is quantum of damages. The credibility of the parties is at the forefront of the determination of the issues. HELD: The vendors are liable to the plaintiff for breach of contract. Each of the defendants is a tortfeasor, each having breached an obligation or duty owed to the plaintiff, whether through negligence or misrepresentation. Their wrongful acts and omissions all contributed to the same damage. In that respect their liability is concurrent. The liability of the vendors and Mr. Jacobucci is joint, and that of Ms. Mui is several. As concurrent torfeasors, the fault for the damage shall be apportioned equally among the four of them.  1) Credibility is not a science, see R. v. Gagnon, 2006 SCC 17. It is not always possible to articulate with precision the complex intermingling of impressions that emerge after watching and listening to witnesses and attempting to reconcile the various versions of events. The principles and tools to be used in assessing credibility are summarized in Novak Estate (Re), 2008 NSSC 283. 2) Certain of the evidence of the Karpinskis and Ms. Mui is so unreliable that the whole of their evidence is cast with doubt. 3) The opinions and conclusions of Mr. Loraas and Mr. Epp are accepted by the court. They are professionals with no interest in the outcome of the action. Their evidence was largely unchallenged. The Court finds that the pine shakes were rotten, sealant had been applied to the shakes on at least two occasions and prior to the plaintiff offering to buy the property, the shakes were not properly installed allowing water to seep into the house, the skylight leaked and caulking had been applied to stop the leaking before the plaintiff offered to buy the house, there was improper and inadequate venting which resulted in moisture damage to the interior of the house and mold in the attic, the moisture damage in the house included damage to drywall and paint blisters. Nail pops throughout the house were largely the result of the house being moved. No inspection was done after the house was moved. 4) The Court finds the Karpinskis did not speak truthfully or completely when they answered the questions in the Property Condition Disclosure Statement (PCDS). The Court does not accept that the vendors were not aware of water and moisture damage arising from the improperly installed shingles, the missing ridge caps, the leaking skylight or the lack of venting. The sealant on the roof was sufficiently old to predate the plaintiff's purchase of the house. The vendors repaired the sink holes and moisture pockets and effectively concealed the problems.

The trial judge calculated the plaintiff's loss of income on the following premises: 1) that the plaintiff had been employed by the defendant for $110,000 year; 2) that he was entitled at common law to eighteen months notice of termination having regard for the fact that he had been in the employ of the Crown in the right of the Province for about a decade; and 3) that his severance terms were prima facie the amount that would have been earned had the employment continued subject to deduction of such amounts as in the ensuing months are either earned or should be earned in light of the duty upon persons suffering losses to keep them to minimum; and 4) the Crown Employment Contracts Act had set aside the contractual provisions for payment on dismissal contained in all Crown contracts including those of Crown corporations and directed instead that payment be determined in accordance with common law.","This is an appeal from an assessment of damages in a wrongful dismissal action brought against Saskatchewan Transportation Company by Leo Larsen, its former President and Chief Executive Officer. In consequence Mr. Larsen obtained a judgment for damages against the corporation in the basic amount of $165,000, an amount it contends is exorbitant. For the most part we can find no tenable basis for concluding that the award of damages was inordinately high. And so we have decided to reduce his damages by some $16,000 to $17,000.

Consequently, the charges against her must be dismissed. [38] In view of the provisions available in the Act to obtain an order of relief from forfeiture, it cannot be concluded that empowering a court to grant an order of forfeiture constitutes cruel and unusual treatment or punishment of any person who may have an interest in the property sought to be forfeited.

The registered owner applied for an order declaring her interest in the vehicle was not affected by any forfeiture order. The owner was passenger when 28.3 pounds of marijuana was discovered in the trunk of her Lincoln. She was found not guilty of trafficking and possession of marijuana for the purpose of trafficking. The driver was found guilty of possession for the purpose of trafficking. The trafficking charge against him was judicially stayed. HELD: An order of forfeiture issued pursuant to s.16(1). The application for relief was dismissed. 1)It was not necessary to address the Charter submissions with respect to s.19(3) because Crown counsel consented to the respondent's application being viewed as an application for relief from forfeiture under s.20. 2)It was impossible to conclude the respondent 'appeared innocent of any complicity' in the offence for which the driver was convicted and that she 'exercised all reasonable care to be satisfied' that the Lincoln was not likely to be used in the commission of the offence. 3)Section 11 of the Charter applies only when person has been charged with an offence. There was no charge against the respondent at this time. 4)The Act distinguishes between three types of persons who might own, or have an interest in, conveyance which is 'offence-related property': the interest of person convicted of the offence is forfeitable pursuant to s.16(1); if the person has been neither convicted nor charged and appears innocent of any complicity in the offence; someone charged with the offence which gave rise to the forfeiture application (as here). The forfeiture is not, except with respect to an offender, arbitrary. In view of the provisions available under the Act to obtain relief from forfeiture it cannot be concluded that empowering a court to grant an order of forfeiture constitutes cruel or unusual punishment.","The Crown applied pursuant to s. 16(1) of the Controlled Drug and Substances Act for an order forfeiting the Lincoln. The registered owner of the vehicle was charged with trafficking in marihuana and possession of marijuana for the purpose of trafficking. Fair was found guilty of possession and the other charge was stayed. Brooks applied for relief from forfeiture on the basis that her interest in the Lincoln was not affected by any forfeiture order. HELD: The application was dismissed with costs. 1)The societal purpose of the Act and the provisions related to the forfeiture of property was not the same as that of the automobile. 2)The automobile was not intended to be used as a 'offence-related property' but rather as a conveyance that was used to facilitate the commission of a designated substance offence. 3)The Lincoln was owned and operated by the same person for 14 years. 4)Section 20(4) prescribes the powers of the court upon the hearing of an application for forfeiture. The court must first consider the gravity of the offence, the personal characteristics of the offender and the particular circumstances of the case in order to determine what range of sentences would have been appropriate to punish and punish. 5)The test for determining whether a sentence is disproportionately long is very properly stringent and demanding. A lesser test would tend to trivialise the Charter. 6)Section 19(3) provides the authority for the court to make an order of relief from forfeiting.

The respondent would have regular weekly parenting time with the children; and 3) the evidence was inadequate to consider child support.","The third party in this matter is the maternal grandmother of the two children.

The father takes the position that it would be in the children’s best interests to move from the primary care of the grandmother to his primary care.

The grandparents’ relationship with the children was not fostered by the father. 2) The father was granted supervised access to the children for three weekends in a row with no access on the fourth weekend. He was to have supervised access for the children. 3) The parties’ children were to reside primarily with the grandmother. There was no evidence that the father was unable or unwilling to pay child support for the two boys. 4) The grandmother was to provide the father with parenting time. 5) The proper focus of an inquiry in relation to the “sufficient interest” question, in the nature of the relationship between the applicant and the child, was the nature and relationship of the child. The nature and intensity of the relationships between the parties and their best interests did not enter the analysis at that point. The evidence from the grandmother was insufficient to determine whether the father could show a settled commitment to the child and an intention to be continuing and meaningful presence in the life of the baby. The court could have served an application for contempt by obtaining an order for substitutional service.","He seeks an order that he have custody of the children.

4_2008skqb174.txt,"Accused pleaded guilty at opening of trial to one count of distributing child pornography in the form of written works. The accused was active on a pedophile website and posted 11 stories describing sexual activity between men and infants and pre-teen girls. HELD: Accused received 15 months imprisonment followed by 3 years of probation with addition orders including providing DNA samples and being added to the Sex Offender Registry. The Court accepted that the internet has led to the accelerated proliferation of child pornography, making it an increasing social problem. The social harm of such material is borne almost exclusively by infants and children, the most defenceless members of society. For this reason, denunciation and deterrence are the dominant sentencing principles. The defence submitted that the writings do not actually harm children in their making and, therefore, should not be subject to the same denunciation as pornographic images. The Court rejected this argument because it cannot be assumed that the writings do not stimulate the demand for images and since not all pedophiles are voyeurs only some will act on their desires and anything that stimulates this desire places children at risk in the real world. Aggravating factors in this case were 1) the fact that the accused extolled pedophilia and wrote hard core child pornography and encouraged others to the same. 2) The accused was a high profile contributor to the web site and he remains unrepentant Ã» he does not believe there is anything wrong with writing these stories and only stopped because the law requires it.

In any event, in 1987 he qualified for disability pension under the Canada Pension Plan by reason of his mental disability. This provided his basic income of $580.00 a month. When you factor in the G.S.T. rebate his total monthly income is $630. At present he lives with a friend and buys the food for both of them. This cannot continue indefinitely. There is another source of revenue and that is the farm land which is rented out. He has de facto possession of the land and receives the entire rental. The difference in value relates to certain farmland which the respondent brought into the marriage. On that amount, the respondent's total annual income would be $23,560. The Federal Child Support Guidelines would stipulate payment of $442.00. Any order as contemplated will not jeopardize the welfare of the children.",0.336

The first complainant suffered severe first and second degree burns to his face and to his shoulders as well as numerous puncture wounds and lacerations but was not critically injured. The accused was charged with aggravated assault on the first complainant and common assault on the second complainant. None of the inmates testified at trial other than the accused. The accused testified that he felt he was being shunned in the Block and had received threats from the first complainant and others in the complainant's group who were brandishing shanks earlier that day. The defence argued that the Crown failed to prove that the injuries caused to the first complainant fell within the definition of 'wound, maim, disfigure or endanger life'; and that the acts done to the first and second complainants were in self-defence as contemplated by s. 34 of the Criminal Code. HELD: The accused was convicted of both counts. 1) In relation to the accused's defence of self-defence pursuant to s. 34(2) pertaining to the first complainant, the Court found the accused did not believe that he was being assaulted within the meaning of the law and, even if he did hold this belief, such a belief was not reasonable in the circumstances. Further, the Court did not accept, on a subjective or objective basis, that the accused reasonably believed that the first complainant had the present ability to carry out the threat, notwithstanding that the physical aspect of the assault need not be imminent or immediate. Lastly, the Court found that the accused did not believe that he had no other option. The accused admitted that he had other options but chose not to avail himself of them. 2) The Court found it did not need to assess the application of s. 37 of the Code in relation to the common assault charge. Rather, the Court found s. 27 of the Code applicable and determined that the second complainant was legally justified to use as much force as was reasonably necessary to prevent the commission of an offence which would be arrestable without warrant.

The accused and the two alleged victims were inmates at the prison and were being held on 'B' Block. Given that the incident was captured by two security videos, there is no doubt as to what happened. The issues raised by the accused are how his actions ought to be characterized. 1) The accused inflicted injuries to the victim that fit within the category of an aggravated assault. It is legally irrelevant whose shanks caused which injuries. 2) The mens rea requirement for aggravated assault is an objective foresight of bodily harm as contemplated by s. 34(2) of the Criminal Code. The Court held that an assault may be made by a person doing, or omitting to do, acts for the purpose of aiding a principal to commit an offence; and 3) self-defence is not available to the accused. In this case, it is not legally necessary to distinguish and isolate the specific acts of Knife from the acts of the other joint participants. The terms 'aiding' and 'abetting' have similar meanings. To “aid” under s. 21(1)(b) means to assist or help the actor. The requirement of an objective analysis ensures that the criminal law encourages reasonable and responsible behaviour.","[1] The accused, Frederick Junior Knife (the “accused” or “Knife”), is charged with one count of aggravated assault and one count of common assault relating to a violent incident that took place in the maximum security unit of the Saskatchewan Penitentiary at approximately 8:30 p.m. on September 1, 2008.

[33] I will next deal with the argument that Knife’s actions against Dorion were done in self‑defence as contemplated by s. 34(2) of the Criminal Code. [63] Accordingly, I conclude that the accused did not believe that he was being assaulted, within the meaning of the law, and that, even if he did hold this belief, which I find not to be the case, such a belief was not reasonable in the circumstances. Nonetheless, I reject both the subjective and objective components of the second prong of the test for the same reasons that I rejected the first prong of the test. However, as I stated previously, I do not accept, on a subjective or objective basis, Knife reasonably believed that Dorion had the present ability to carry out the threat, notwithstanding that the physical aspect of the assault need not be imminent or immediate. [71] Firstly, dealing with the subjective element, I find that Knife did not believe that he had no other option. However, I do not need to assess the application of s. 37 because I find that s. 27 of the Criminal Code is applicable. Consequently, I find that Demeria was clothed in legal justification when he entered the fray. I find, as well, that Knife is not entitled to the protection of s. 34(1) because Knife provoked the assault, and the force he used was more than necessary to enable him to defend himself. It is obvious from the video recordings that Knife was armed with a shank, whereas Demeria was not, and that stabbing Demeria and holding him so that he could not get away, as Dreaver and Knife were doing, was far more force than was necessary to enable him to defend himself. Conclusion [90] In the final analysis, I find that the Crown has made out all of the elements of both counts beyond a reasonable doubt and, therefore, find Frederick Junior Knife guilty of both Count 1 and Count 2 as specified in the indictment.",0.1649048625792812,"HELD: The accused was charged with aggravated assault and one count of common assault relating to a violent incident that took place in the maximum security unit of the Saskatchewan Penitentiary at approximately 8:30 p.m. on September 1, 2008. The accused and the two alleged victims were inmates at the prison and were being held on 'B' Block. Given that the incident was captured by two security videos, there is no doubt as to what happened. The issues raised by the accused are how his actions ought to be characterized. 1) The accused inflicted injuries to the victim that fit within the category of an aggravated assault. It is legally irrelevant whose shanks caused which injuries. 2) The mens rea requirement for aggravated assault is an objective foresight of bodily harm as contemplated by s. 34(2) of the Criminal Code. The Court held that an assault may be made by a person doing, or omitting to do, acts for the purpose of aiding a principal to commit an offence; and 3) self-defence is not available to the accused. In this case, it is not legally necessary to distinguish and isolate the specific acts of Knife from the acts of the other joint participants. The terms 'aiding' and 'abetting' have similar meanings. To “aid” under s. 21(1)(b) means to assist or help the actor. The requirement of an objective analysis ensures that the criminal law encourages reasonable and responsible behaviour.",0.19230769230769232
