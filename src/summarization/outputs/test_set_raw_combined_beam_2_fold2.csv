The original mortgage executed by the plaintiff was for $191,000 of which $176,000 was advanced to purchase her condominium and $15,000, eight per cent of the total, was advanced for other purchases. The property sold for $156,000 pursuant to a judicial sale. The sale proceeds were distributed to pay outstanding property taxes, commission, and the principal and interest due under the mortgage in the amount of $141,945 and the net sale proceeds were to be distributed pro rata. As at November 1, 2017, the principal and interest owing on the non-purchase money portion of the mortgage was $21,250. The plaintiff requested judgment for the deficiency in the amount of $9,900 with interest to the date of judgment. It claimed it was entitled to solicitor-client costs and other costs accrued by it under the mortgage. The issue was whether such costs should be subject to the pro rata calculation for the nonpurchase portion of the mortgage, that is, 8 percent of the total costs incurred.  HELD: The application was granted. The court found that the plaintiff was entitled to a deficiency judgment for principal and interest owed under the mortgage in the amount requested. It was also entitled to judgment against the mortgagee for eight percent of the solicitor-client costs, condominium fees and property management charges.","FIAT: Royal Bank of Canada applies by notice of application for a deficiency judgment against the defendant, Doreen Pearl Partridge, pertaining to the non-purchase money portion of the outstanding indebtedness to her mortgage. RBC also applies to have its lawyers' costs assessed on a solicitor-client basis. The issue is whether the pro rata distribution of purchase money, non- purchase money and non- Purchase money proceeds in any deficiency judgment pursuant to a judicial sale extends to the total outstanding amount of the mortgage. HELD: The issue here is whether pro rae distribution applies solely to the indebtedness of principal and accrued interest or applies to all costs of the remaining mortgage, including solicitor-and-client costs permitted under the mortgage, or applies with respect to the property management charges.  1) The pro-rata calculation of the non‑purch money mortgage is 8% of the total amount. In this case, the pro-rate calculation is adjusted to include the total condominium fees and the total property management charge. 2) The respondent is entitled to judgment against Partridge in an amount of $9,901.23 with interest from November 1, 2017 to the date of judgment at the rate of 2.79 per cent per annum representing the deficiency of the principal and interest owed under the Mortgage. The solicitor‑client costs and other costs accrued by RBC under its mortgage are included in the deficiency judgment. 3) The sufficiency of s. 11 of The Limitation of Civil Rights Act, RSS 1978, L‑16 [LCRA] is relevant to this case. The pro ratement of solicitor- and other cost-effectiveness for non-Purch money mortgages is not applicable here. The respondent should not have the solicitor-custodial costs prorated in accordance with the non Purchase Money portion of its mortgage. The Saskatchewan Court of Appeal was not required to address the prorating of solicitor costs because the parties had consented to having the matter remitted to the Queen's Bench judge. However, Walker is instructive in explaining the policy objective of sec. 8 of the LCRA. The protection of s s. 8(1) of the LRA pertains only to those costs which are part of the overall outstanding mortgage amount. The case law in question is whether such costs should be subject to the pro reata calculation for the non‐purchase portion of a mortgage, that is, 8% the total costs incurred. In the case of Part"
e_2016skca29.txt,"HELD: The majority of the court granted leave to appeal and restored the conviction entered by the trial judge. The parties and court agreed that the provisions of s. 34(1) as they read prior to May 2012 were applicable. The issues were determined as follows: 1) the appeal court judge erred by misunderstanding the applicable test and inappropriately focusing on the respondent’s belief. The appeal court judge reviewed cases that led him to focus on the doctrine of mistake of fact, which was not argued by the respondent at trial and were not part of his grounds of appeal; 2) the trial judge accepted some but not all of the expert’s evidence, as he was entitled to do. The trial judge also reinterpreted the video evidence, which was found to be an error by the Court of Appeal. The trial judge considered the factors without weighing the use of force to a nicety. He was determining the objective reasonableness of the force based on the factors; and 3) the appeal court judge properly instructed himself on the standard of review but failed to analyze the decision of the trial judge based on that standard, namely, whether the evidence was reasonably capable of supporting the trial judge’s conclusion based on the evidence as a whole. The dissenting judge would have granted leave to appeal but then would have dismissed the appeal. The dissenting judge of the Court of Appeal found that the appeal court judge erred in his approach but reached the right conclusion that the trial judge erred. The trial judge ignored the fact that the encounter was only three seconds long and he mischaracterized the thrust-kick as extreme force. The respondent had to react quickly. The trial judge also erred in questioning whether the respondent honestly believed he was in danger of harm.","The Crown appealed the conviction of the respondent member of the Regina City Police Service who pushed the victim of a sexual assault to the ground and kicked him in the abdomen. The Summary Conviction Appeal Court judge determined that the trial judge had erred in finding the respondent guilty, set aside the conviction and entered an acquittal. The Crown applies for leave to appeal the decision of the summary conviction appeal court pursuant to s. 839 of the Criminal Code. HELD: The appeal is allowed and the conviction is entered in the Provincial Court. 1) The trial judge did not err in his assessment of the force used by the respondent in the defence of self-defence or in considering the nature and extent of the threat. He found that the respondent's response to the assault was reasonable and was not in breach of s. 34(1) of the Code. The trial court judge instructed himself to disregard the evidence of the RCMP officer and to measure the force employed by the police officer to nicety. This is a form of modified objective inquiry. 2) In assessing whether there is an air of reality to the proportionality requirement, that is whether the responsive force was no more than necessary in all of the circumstances, the judge ordered himself to ignore the evidence and to take into account certain factors in his analysis of whether the level of force was objectively reasonable, such as the time period from which the force was used, the number of arrests, the relative strength and size of the parties involved and the applicable onus of proof."
8_2012skpc79.txt,"The accused's neighbour disliked the accused and alleged that the accused drove his vehicle into hers. The police arrested the accused and found a fob that operated the locks on the doors of the vehicle and the engine hood of the accused's vehicle was warm. The accused was charged with hit and run and impaired driving. HELD: The Court found the accused not guilty of both charges. The Court found that the police breaches of the accused's Charter rights were numerous. The approximate 11 minutes of investigative detention was not an infringement of his rights but the combination of the officers' failing to inform the accused of the reason for his arrest and not giving his rights to counsel without delay, coupled with the illegal search and seizure of the fob and keys were in total breaches serious enough to bring the administration of justice into disrepute. The Court excluded the evidence of the fob and keys which further weakened the circumstantial case against the accused to the extent that the Crown failed to prove the accused was the operator of the motor vehicle.","HELD: The evidence was excluded from the evidence pursuant to s. 24(2) of the Charter. The court found that the police had the requisite subjective and objective grounds to detain the accused for approximately 11 minutes, not informing him of the reason for his detention and by not giving him his rights to contact counsel. The defence raised several breaches of the accused’s rights. The police officer who first detained the accused did not inform him of his detention, nor did he advise him that he could consult counsel. When the police arrived at the scene, they requested to examine the vehicle. The officer testified that when he first confronted the accused, he did not believe he had done anything wrong and instead spoke to him about his experience playing loud music and being intoxicated. The accused testified that he had been detained by the police for about 11 minutes when they asked him to stop, and when they first came to the conclusion that he was the driver of the vehicle, which was not supported by the physical evidence, they had searched the vehicle and found the keys and fob. They were also found in the pocket of the officer, who was in the process of searching for the fob and keys, which led through the witness to the officer that the accused was the operator of that vehicle and when he reached into the officer’ s jacket pocket, it was not for his protection but to retrieve the means to help locate the vehicle; the exclusion of the evidence of the keys was a breach of the Accused”s right to be free from an unreasonable search and seizure, breaching s. 10(a) and s. 6 of The Charter."
d_2013skqb90.txt,"The appellants appealed a small claims judgment. The judgment had found the appellants liable for damages after the respondent, who had purchased a house from the appellants, discovered that water was entering his basement. When the respondent investigated the source of the water, he removed the interior wall of the basement and discovered that there was a second wall behind the first one. He also discovered that a large chunk of the concrete footing and concrete grade beam were broken and had slid into the space between the interior basement wall. The respondent obtained a professional opinion that suggested that the problem had been there for a significant period of time and that the wooden beam that sat on the concrete grade beam was rotten and would have to be replaced. The respondent was awarded judgment in the amount of the repair. The appellant appealed on the basis that the trial judge should not have considered the respondent's expert's opinion about the age of the defect, that the trial judge had crossed a line in assisting the self-represented plaintiff at the trial and that the trial judge erred in calculating damages. HELD: The appeal was dismissed. The respondent's expert was qualified as an expert concerning foundation repair and had the necessary experience to give expert evidence on the type of structural repair and the need for structural repair. Once qualified as an expert in the area of foundations and structural repair, he could testify on the nature of the foundation's problems, including the wooden beam. The witness was also the person who actually carried out the repair to the foundation and was entitled to give evidence on what he saw and did. The witness was properly qualified by virtue of his years of experience and the trial judge was entitled to accept his evidence as to the state of the foundation and how long it had been in such a state. The trial judge's intervention and comments to the appellant's lawyer at the trial did not go beyond the nature of a legitimate attempt to ensure that all of the evidence regarding the matters at issue was before the Court with sufficient clarity to allow the trial judge to understand it. The cause of action in this case was negligent misrepresentation. The trial judge found that the appellants were aware of the structural defect and had covered it up. The proper measure of damages is the amount of money required to put the plaintiff in the position he would have occupied if the negligent misrepresentation had not been made. In this case, the judge made no palpable or overriding error in calculating damages at the amount it cost to fix the foundation.","HELD: The appeal was dismissed. The court found that the trial judge erred in weighing necessity and qualification before determining the admissibility of certain opinion evidence tendered on behalf of the plaintiff. The trial judge then awarded damages for repair of broken concrete grade beam and for other repairs in an amount much higher than damages would have been for the triple-ply beam, notwithstanding that liability as to the concrete Grade beam was not established at trial. The respondent was properly qualified by virtue of his years of experience and that he had been awarded pre-judgment interest and costs. It was not clear from the transcript that the respondent made any palpable and overriding error regarding the calculation of damages. HELD: 1) The appeal is dismissed with costs of the appeal to the respondent. 2) There is a strong presumption of impartiality on the part of a trial judge. While there is uncertainty about the timing of the broken concrete-grade beam, which included not only the rotten wooden beam but also the cracks in the foundation, could have been discovered by his property inspector or his property agent, Hancock may then have elected not to proceed with the purchase contract or alternatively remedied the defect before the wall collapsed inward. There is no evidence that the amount of work done was not necessary to repair the damage done when the foundation caved in and water entered the basement.  3) While there has been some evidence of negligent misrepresentation, no palpable or overriding error has been established regarding the determination of damages and the trial court made no palpable, overriding error in determining damages. 4) The trial judges do not rest mute. They are entitled to seek appropriate clarification and give direction and, in certain cases, disclose tentative conclusions as means of ensuring proper understanding of the case."
4_1994canlii4625.txt,"At trial in Provincial Court, the accuseds called no evidence and were convicted. They appealed on the basis that the Crown's evidence was so insufficient that a verdict of guilty was unreasonable or was one which could not reasonably be supported on the evidence. HELD: Appeal dismissed. 1)No medical evidence was necessary to establish that the victim's injuries were caused by an assault, given the photographs admitted into evidence, the evidence of the police officer who was called to the scene of the assault and the evidence of the 7-11 clerk who was first approached by the victim for assistance. 2)Evidence of exclusive opportunity was unnecessary to sustain a conviction where there was other circumstantial evidence pointing to the identity of the accuseds. 3)Although a failure to permit an accused who calls no evidence to argue last in a jury trial might be a good ground of appeal, the failure to be permitted to argue last before a judge alone was merely a procedural error which could be cured under the curative provision contained in S.686(1)(b)(iv) of the Criminal Code.","Appeal from Provincial Court on the issue of whether the evidence adduced by the Crown - the defence called no evidence - was insufficient to such a degree that a verdict of guilty ought to be found by this Courteither unreasonable or one that cannot be supported by the evidence. HELD: Appeal dismissed. 1)The trial judge was correct to find that the evidence did not yield up any reasonable inferences. 2)The court relied on s.651(3) of the Code which provides: 651(2) where no witnesses are examined for an accused, he or his counsel is entitled to address the jury last, but otherwise counsel for the prosecution is entitled, if at present, to address a jury last. 3)There was sufficient evidence for the trial judge to reach conclusion respecting the cause of the injuries beyond a reasonable doubt without resorting to medical opinion. On the question of identity, it was readily resolved by the description of the injury given by the victim (who did not remember how the injuries were inflicted) by looking at the photographs of the Crown witnesses. The testimony in that respect was speculative and could not form an evidentiary base for reasonable inference. To the foregoing, the fact that the appellants both failed to testify adds to the difficulty."
c_1993canlii4474.txt,"The parties lived together for 14 years and had three children, aged eight, 13 and 14. The petitioner always worked and eventually became a successful stockbroker. The respondent was employed part-time doing minimum wage jobs and was responsible for the household duties and raising their children. The petitioner's annual income was $50,000 at the time of separation, but escalated to $200,000 in 1992 and was prone to great fluctuation. The respondent was to have custody of the children. She sought spousal and child support and an unequal division of assets. Ordering support and an unequal division of assets. The court extensively reviewed the case of Moge v. Moge (1992), 43 R.F.L.(3d) 345 (S.C.C.) and found that marriage and child care responsibilities hinder a wife's role in the workplace. The court awarded $4500 per month as spousal and child support, plus an additional $500 while the wife retrained. The court considered this an appropriate case for an unequal division of matrimonial assets in the respondent's favour. Finding that the awards were still not sufficient to satisfy the respondent's needs, a lump sum award of $18,000 was ordered. On appeal.","The parties, along with the respondent, decided to divorce. The respondent sought to have her share of the matrimonial assets and debts divided equally. The court found that the physical division represented an unequal division in favour of the respondent to the extent of $16,868. She sought an order specifying the terms and conditions of a deferral of interest rate or return on investment, and an order that the respondent should have reasonable scheduled access. In addition, she sought some amount of funds to defray costs of tuition and retraining. HELD: The court held that the divorce was a clean break between the spouses, and that it would be unlikely in many situations for the dependent spouse to have the skills or opportunity to enter the work force at level she would have gained but for leaving her position as custodial parent. There was no possibility of reconciliation between the parties. As the respondent's income was reduced to $2,500 per month, the court awarded her $1,000 month in spousal and child support, and ordered that the assets be divided equally (except for the mortgage). The respondent was to continue working at the franchise until she was retrained."

He was required to discontinue his studies for failure to meet academic standards for promotion. The applicant appealed his dismissal and was unsuccessful throughout. He applied to the Court for an order of certiorari to quash the decision of the Academic Appeals Committee and the University Bylaws Committee Council and an order reinstating him as a student at the College of Medicine pending resolution of his appeal. HELD: The Court found that the Bylaws Committee Council exceeded its jurisdiction by reviewing the previous decisions made and drawing the conclusion that they were made fairly and properly. The Bylaw Committee determined the merits of the applicant's appeal and determined that it was not necessary to convene a full appeal board. There is nothing in the University policy to suggest that the Bylaws Committee has that power. The Bylaws Committee has exceeded its jurisdiction in this regard and its decision is quashed. The matter is returned to the Bylaws Committee to determine whether the applicant's appeal falls within the policy on student appeals and academic matters. The portion of the application requesting reinstatement of the applicant as a student pending the resolution of his appeal is dismissed. The applicant has a marginal academic record and there are a limited number of placements in the College of Medicine. It does not make sense to displace another student or require the College of Medicine to train a marginal student on a potentially temporary basis.,"The applicant was required to discontinue his studies for a failure to meet the academic standards for promotion. He followed the appeal procedures found in the College of Medicine and University, but was unsuccessful throughout. He applied to quash the Academic Appeals Committee and the University Bylaws Committee of Council, seeking an order reinstating him as a student at the college of medicine pending resolution of his appeal. HELD: The certiorari application was dismissed. On the assumption that his applications will be successful, he seeks an order of reinstatement and a review of the university's policies and procedures to determine whether or not an appeal falls within para.1(a) of Part VI. The parties agree as to the legal approach to be adopted by the court in analysing this application. Both parties rely on the decision of Barclay J. in Houston v. University of Saskatchewan (1994), [1994] W.W.R. 291 (Q.B.), where he stated that: 1) the applicant has already been given an opportunity to present his case, including his allegations for procedural unfairness and discriminatory treatment, to a properly constituted academic appeals committee with the authority to hear and remedy such allegations. 2) There is nothing in the policy to suggest the Bylaw Committee has such power. In fact, if the power existed in the Board of Regents it would have operated as a vetting step and of course no need for the establishment of an appeal board. 3) It is not appropriate however for the Court to usurp the function of the Committee and review the material to determine if in opinion, the matter should be remitted to the appeal board under Part V, para.3. The matter is returned to the appellant's Committee for a decision according to law that is whether the applicant's appeal falls under Part VI, the policy on student appeals and academic matters. 4) The applicant has a marginal academic record. take judicial notice of the fact that the University has a limited number of placements within its College of medicine and that the training of physician is lengthy and expensive process vis-à-vis the University.

The deputy rentalsman ordered that the landlord should have possession, but also ordered that the last two months rent would abate in order to assist the tenants with their moving costs. The landlord appealed the abatement of rent and a chambers judge reversed the deputy rentalsman. The tenants sought and were granted leave to appeal the chambers judge and this appeal resulted. HELD: Appeal allowed. 1)The chambers judge could only reverse the deputy rentalsman if he exceeded his jurisdiction or erred in law. 2)The deputy rentalsman had jurisdiction to order an abatement of rent pursuant to S.47(4) of the Act. 3)The jurisdiction is a discretionary one. The court will therefore show some deference to a decision of the rentalsman involving this jurisdiction. In this case the deputy rentalsman made no reversible error.","The issues in this case began long before the notice of termination of tenancy (which ultimately prompted this Court's involvement) and stem from a number of complaints made by both the tenants and the landlord. The landlord began leasing his premises to the tenants in August 1994. The tenants applied first to the Rentalsman's Office for an order directing the landlord to remove a stove, replace refrigerator and make appropriate repairs to floor tiles, fence and gate. The deputy rentalsman released his decision shortly after the landlord appealed. The Deputy rentalsman appealed. Appeal allowed; decision of the rentalsman restored. As neither the landlord nor the tenant was represented by counsel, there was no order as to costs."

He contended the trial judge erred by permitting the complainant to testify behind a screen without first conducting a voir dire and by relying on Crown's submission the girl would be uncomfortable without the screen.

Dismissing the appeal, that the fairness of the trial was in no way impaired by use of the screen, and no miscarriage of justice occurred. The statement was given the complainant by defence counsel, who suggested she read v.

He was sentenced to six months imprisonment. The grounds of appeal on the first ground were that the trial judge was in error in permitting the complainant to testify behind a screen without first conducting a voir dire and by relying solely upon the representations of the Crown counsel to the effect that she would be uncomfortable without a screen. The second ground was that the judge interfered with the trial and created an impression of unfairness by posing questions to the complainant and another witness during the course of their testimony. Appeal against conviction dismissed and appeal against sentence abandoned. The decision was reasonably supported by the evidence. The third ground, which alleged that the appellant had improperly exercised his discretion under s. 482 (2.1) of the Code, was dismissed and the sentence was not reduced to six month imprisonment."
c_2014skqb284.txt,HELD: The court dismissed both applications. The respondent’s voluntary decision to significantly reduce his income was insufficient grounds to vary his child support application. The court found that there had not been a material change in the circumstances with regard to the petitioner’s application.,"The respondent father has applied to reduce his child support obligation and to extinguish arrears of child support as a result of him quitting his job and embarking on an apprenticeship program to become an electrician. Both parties have two children who are now eight and nine years of age. The children reside with the respondent and the respondent is to have reasonable access on reasonable notice. It appears the respondent has not been exercising access and has had little involvement in the lives of the children. HELD: The application to vary child support is sought to be varied pursuant to s. 10 of the Family Maintenance Act, 1997 in which there must be material change in circumstances to warrant variation of the child support order. The preliminary question is therefore whether voluntary change constitutes a material change. For voluntary change to be material, it must be reasonable in the circumstances. The respondent's voluntary decision to significantly reduce his income is found to be insufficient grounds to vary his childsupport obligation. The father's decision was ill-conceived. The Court had considered Tice like suspension of payments to allow the respondent to obtain appropriate employment. However, this did not appear to be an appropriate case for the Court to exercise its discretion in."

HELD: Appeal dismissed. 1)The legislation provides for an appeal to the Court of Queen's Bench and for no further appeal. Such an appeal can be taken on the following grounds: (a)the committee exceeded its jurisdiction; (b)it failed to observe the rules of natural justice; (c)it made an error of law; (d)its findings can not be reasonably supported by the evidence which it was entitled to consider. 2) The Court found no error of jurisdiction or failure to observe the rules of natural justice. 3)The Court found no palpable or overriding error in the facts as determined by the Committee based on the evidence.","An amedical doctor was reassessed and ordered to repay billings already received as a result of services provided to patients. The Committee did not have jurisdiction to enter into the practice of the physician as there was no reasonable apprehension of bias with respect to the member of the Committee who had hospital privileges. The committee committed an error of law by misinterpreting the empowering legislation and their duty under that legislation. HELD: The Committee's decision was set aside and the appeal was dismissed. 1)There was insufficient evidence before the Committee to constitute proof that the doctor's delivery of medical services was unacceptable from a medical perspective. The evidence before it was reasonably supported by the evidence and the appropriate remedy was taken. 2)The Committee exceeded its jurisdiction by focusing on irrelevant considerations and thereby abused its discretion and acted on inadequate materials. 3)The presence of a cardiologist on the Committee gave rise to a reasonable apprehension that bias against the physician may affect its decision. 4)With regard to the factual findings of the committee, the court found that there was an excess of jurisdiction which could have resulted in a denial of justice or an error in law.

9_2010skqb122.txt,"FIAT: This is an application for an order pursuant to s. 63(2) of The Personal Property Security Act requiring the respondents or those in possession to deliver to the applicant four pieces of construction equipment. The four pieces of equipment were rented by applicant, Inland, to respondents, Mike Dery Holdings Ltd. and Giants Head Excavating Ltd. pursuant to an equipment rental contract entered into at Penticton, British Columbia, between April 21, 2008 and August 6, 2008. Inland did not register any security interest in the equipment in British Columbia or Saskatchewan until October 20, 2009. In the fall of 2008, the equipment was transported to Saskatchewan by Mike Dery Holdings Ltd. and/or Giants Head. In February of 2009, respondent 101138096 purchased the equipment from Mike Dery Holdings Ltd. and Giants Head for valuable consideration. Searches were completed to establish no registrations against the equipment. In April of 2009, the equipment was leased to Giants Head and a security agreement registered in Saskatchewan on May 5, 2009 listing the equipment as general property but not specifically registering the equipment by serial number. The security agreement was taken by 101138096 to secure the rental payments owed to it under the lease by Giants Head who had possession of the equipment. Mike Dery Holdings Ltd. and Giants Head defaulted under their payments to Inland and Giants Head defaulted in its payments to 101138096. September 18, 2009, 101138096 seized the equipment leaving it in the possession of Giants Head. The equipment was subsequently removed from Giants Head's possession and stored at the farm of Bruce Bakken. On October 19, 2009, 101138096 forwarded a letter to Giants Head confirming that 101138096 had elected to retain the equipment as payment for the outstanding indebtedness. As of this date a Personal Property Security registry search in Saskatchewan disclosed no security interest other than that of 101138096 in the equipment. Inland subsequently registered both a British Columbia and Saskatchewan Personal Property registry interest by serial number respecting the equipment and its original agreements of 2008. The issue before the Court is whether Inland by virtue of its Personal Property Security registration by serial number on October 20, 2009 has priority over the interest of 101138096 which registered earlier as general security without serial numbers but who alleges to have taken possession of the equipment and elected to retain the equipment seized in satisfaction of Giants Head's indebtedness October 19, 2009. This occurred one day prior to the registration of the security interest by serial number of Inland. HELD: The application is dismissed with costs to the respondents. The respondent 101138096 had a general security registered and had actual possession of the equipment in early October 2009 which therefore perfected its security while it retained possession. As of October 19, 2009 when 101138096 elected to take the collateral as satisfaction of the debt the only party to whom notice was required was the debtor Giants Head and his notice is in compliance with s. 61(1) and s. 61(3) of the Act. When the applicant completed its registration on October 20, 2009 the collateral was no longer available because of 101138096's election on October 19, 2009. The respondent perfected its security interest in the equipment which is subject to this application by taking possession thereof. Electing to take the collateral as satisfaction of the obligation secured and providing the required notices prior to registration by the applicant, transferred title to the equipment to the respondent 101138096 free and clear of the claim of the applicant.","FIAT.

HELD: The husband was ordered to pay $213,213 for the 1993 maintenance and to eliminate the ongoing obligation for support based on Sandra's representations to the court and his letter to the Maintenance Enforcement Office.  1)The husband had improved his income during the past 3 years and was entitled to variation of maintenance for 1997-96. 2)The arrearages owed during 1993 to 1997 had not materially changed. 3)The wife was awarded judgment for $213.213.  4)The parties had one child, born April 9, 1975. The first year of that child, the husband actually paid $4,200 per month in 1992. Based on the evidence presented to the Court by the wife, it would appear that his income had not improved substantially during the intervening years. However, the Court found that the wife's evidence that she had significantly increased her income during this period did not apply to this application."
b_1996canlii6818.txt,"At issue was the determination of the quantum of spousal and child support and division of matrimonial property. HELD: 1)The respondent's supplementary allowances were taken into consideration in finding a gross salary of $53,000.00 per annum. Due to an injury he was no longer able to work overtime but was working full-time. Should a medical discharge become necessary an application to vary can be brought at that time. 2)The petitioner suffered a substantial economic disadvantage. The frequent moves due to the husband's employment had disrupted the petitioner's employment and university education. However, the court must also take into consideration the economic advantage enjoyed as a result of the marriage including the pension plan of the spouse. 3)If the petitioner did receive the greater share of the household goods it can be attributed to partial compensation for her economic disadvantage. Shares in joint names were divided equally. Other assets were divided equally. 4)Upon the granting of the divorce the petitioner will be disqualified from receiving the pension survivorship benefits. The fair solution was to use the enhanced value of the 'With Survivorship Benefits' column and the date of adjudication was used as the valuation date. The combination method of valuation was used in view of the 15 year marriage and given the economic disadvantage suffered by the petitioner. 5)The parties agreed that child support should be set in accordance with the Federal/Provincial/Territorial guidelines based on the respondent's gross yearly income. $600.00 per month per child was awarded.  6)The court must seek to promote the economic self-sufficiency of each spouse. The petitioner's future plans were realistic. $800 per month until June 1, 2001 was awarded for spousal support.  7)Costs including one-half of the cost of preparing reports and pension valuations were awarded to the petitioner.","The parties agreed on their divorce and that Mary be granted custody of the children with reasonable access to John. There was disagreement as to the quantum of maintenance and spousal and child support, but the parties agreed that the amount of maintenance should be based on the Federal/Provincial/Territorial Family Law Committee's Guidelines. The respondent was to pay $600 per month per child for support for the children, an equal division of matrimonial property and costs.HELD: 1)The reasonable and realistic figure to use for the determination of maintenance was a gross salary of $53,000 per annum. If there was any significant decrease in income in the future, Mary could always make an application to vary. 2)The parties were to jointly pay $54,800 per year for the maintenance of the two children, $23,800 for support of the wife, and $5,340 for spousals and child maintenance. 3)The mother was to receive her share in the distribution of the matrimonial property.  4)The evidence showed that Mary had a substantial economic disadvantage as she was unable to obtain security and tenure of employment or to build up fringe benefits for future security. However, she was able to continue to contribute to the children's needs and, in the absence of any government interference, the children should be provided with adequate housing."

The respondent seized the vehicle and issued a statement of claim for $5,330.81 as arrears of lease payments. The applicant had made payments for several months and acknowledged that she was in default on the payments for the tractor-trailer unit but contended the agreement was not a lease and that the respondent, having repossessed the collateral, was not now entitled to claim any additional payments. HELD: The application was dismissed. Costs in the cause. 1)The relief sought did not fall within any of the wording of s63(2) of the Personal Property Security Act and therefore there was no jurisdiction to grant the relief requested. The application was simply an attempt to end run the action commenced by the respondent. 2)The applicant was not seeking to remedy a wrong with respect to the seizure or preservation of the collateral but was seeking a remedy pursuant to the Limitations of Civil Rights Act.

The applicant applied for an order for the return of funds held in trust for the action pursuant to s.63 of the Personal Property Security Act. The parties entered into an agreement in 1997 that the lessor agreed to lease a tractor trailer unit to the applicant for payments. The vehicle was seized in 1997 and the applicant was in default with respect to such payments until 1997. The lessor issued a statement of claim claiming the sum of $5,330.81 from the applicant being the combined amount due and owing by the parties for arrears of lease payments with the value of goods required to be purchased pursuant to the agreement being tires and starter which the defendant did promise to pay to the plaintiff upon repossession. The respondent issued a pre- judgment garnishee summons for the amount claimed, which was paid into court by the applicant on July 22, 1997. HELD: The application was dismissed.

3_1999canlii12362.txt,"The appellant appeals his conviction of sexual assault causing bodily harm on the ground the trial judge erred in preventing cross-examination of the complainant. The trial judge prevented the cross-examination of the complainant in relation to a previous allegation she had made relating to this sexual assault. The offence is alleged to have taken place at home of the appellant's brother. The appellant was asked by his brother and sister-in-law to babysit their daughter. The allegation was that the appellant had entered her parent's bedroom where she was sleeping and sexually assaulted her. The appellant, who has no previous record, was convicted of the charge and sentenced to three years imprisonment. The appellant during cross-examination of the complainant attempted to question her regarding a previous allegation regarding the same sexual assault against another person. The trial judge did not permit this line of questioning as he held it pertained to her past sexual history. HELD: Appeal allowed. The failure of the trial judge to allow this cross-examination has prevented the appellant from having a fair trial as he has been denied the opportunity to make full answer and defence. It seems the question that should have been put to the trial judge on this occasion was whether this section was applicable to a situation involving non-consensual sex. The complainant was not being questioned about her consensual sexual activities but rather a previous complainant of a sexual assault. It is understood the intent was to indicate the complainant had implicated someone else as the assailant and after investigation the complaint had not been acted upon. That evidence could have placed in doubt the reliability of the complainant's identification of the person who assaulted her since the room was dark when the assault was alleged to have occurred. The relevance of such a question pertaining to the existence of another complaint made by the complainant in respect of the same assault is obvious. That question has a direct bearing on her credibility.","The appellant was convicted of sexual assault causing bodily harm contrary to s. 272(c) of the Criminal Code. He appealed the conviction on the ground that the trial judge erroneously interpreted s. 276 of the Code to prevent proper cross-examination of the complainant in relation to a previous allegation she had made relating to this sexual assault. HELD: The appeal was allowed and a new trial ordered.  1)The trial judge failed to consider the nature of the problems the complainant had in her youth, the strength of her resolve to fight the assault, her level of confidence in the appellant, her ability to make full answer and defence and the relevance of the evidence to an issue at trial. 2)The Crown contended that s. 277 is not applicable to non-consensual sexual activity. The Court found that the failure to permit the cross- examination of the appellant regarding another complaint she made about a sexual assault prevented the appellant from having a fair trial as he had been denied the opportunity to makefull answer and defend.  3)The Court was of the view that the Crown was not taking the position that the defence should have waited until the charge was withdrawn and then proceeded to call the complainant as a witness. The Crown should have simply been directed to respond to the question, not so as to permit an assessment of her previous sexual conduct, but to clarify what previous complaint she may have made about this alleged assault. That question had a direct bearing on the complainant's credibility."

That date had been found to be earlier than November 26, 1992 which is set out in s. 228, one of the Act's transitional provisions.

6_2001canlii365.txt,"The accused was charged with impaired driving (Criminal Code ss.255(1) and 253(a)) and with operating a motor vehicle while having a blood alcohol concentration exceeding .08 (Criminal Code ss.253(b) and 255(1)). Issues included whether the Court should enter a stay of proceedings and award costs, given the failure of the Crown to produce a standard alcohol solution (SAS); could mouth alcohol have invalidated the roadside screening test; did the arresting officer have reasonable and probable grounds to demand a breath sample; was the accused denied his right to counsel; was the breathalyzer test administered as soon as practicable; was there evidence to the contrary? HELD: The accused was found not guilty on count #2 (exceeding .08). Count #1 (impaired driving) was dismissed during the trial.  1)The court was cognizant of the burden of proof and had reviewed the decision of R. v. Lifchus concerning reasonable doubt. 2)The accused's testimony was rejected as not being credible. 3)The burden lies with the applicant on an application pursuant to ss.7 and 24(1) of the Charter in which the defence alleges the accused's right to make full answer and defence has been infringed. The question remained whether once the defence established it sought the SAS but it was not provided for whatever reason, had it discharged its burden or must it prove the failure to produce the SAS solution could have a meaningful outcome on the trial. 4)The accused's s.7 Charter right to make full answer and defence was infringed by the failure of the Crown to produce a sample of the SAS solution in this case. In light of the Bourget and Kalafut decisions, the Crown has had ample opportunity to establish a system for routinely saving the solution until after a case has been concluded. It would bring the administration of justice into disrepute were the Certificate of Analysis admitted into evidence. It was more appropriate to exclude the Certificate of Analysis than to grant a stay of proceedings.  5)Costs are rarely awarded in criminal proceedings. Given the evidence presented concerning the usefulness of testing a representative SAS ampule had it been produced, the court was not persuaded costs should be awarded. 6)There was no evidence that created a reasonable doubt as to the time that elapsed or that there may have been mouth alcohol which may have invalidated the roadside screening test. Both the subjective and objective tests were met. The arresting officer, who has no reason to believe an accused has consumed alcohol in the last 15 minutes, may administer the roadside screening test without delay, but to do so carries with it a certain risk that there may be subsequently evidence which will invalidate the results (affecting the objective element of the test). Further, the officer has no duty to routinely wait 15 minutes before administering the test nor to ask the accused whether or not alcohol has been consumed in the preceding 15 minutes. However, if there are circumstances which suggest the officer should have waited or inquired about alcohol consumption, this may affect the reasonableness of the officer's belief (the subjective test). 7)There was nothing in the evidence to support the submission that the speedometers need to be checked to support the officer's evidence. The officer was acting in the lawful execution of his duty in stopping the accused's vehicle. While doing so he detected an odour of alcohol on the accused's breath which gave rise to the demand for a roadside screening. 8)The informational component of the right to counsel was satisfied. There was no evidence the accused misunderstood his right nor that he was not given sufficient opportunity to contact counsel. He declined twice, giving a clear and unequivocal waiver. Absent special circumstance, the police cannot be expected to draw information out of the accused. 9)The samples were taken as soon as practicable. It was accepted that there was typically no one available at the detachment in the small community and was sufficient reason to not consider attending there given the proximity of the city. The officer tried the closest detachment but found no one there. It may have been more important to question the judgment of the officer to return to the Saskatoon detachment if the delay had been more significant. On the face of it, the delay of 27 minutes did not seem unreasonable. 10)The statutory presumption applied. There was no evidence to the contrary as the accused's evidence was rejected. The court reviewed R. v. Gibson and considered s.258(1)(c) and (d.1) of the Criminal Code.","The accused was charged with impaired driving contrary to s. 255(1) and s. 253(a) of the Criminal Code and driving with a blood alcohol content over.08 contrary to ss.253(b) and 253(1)) of the Code. The accused was stopped by the RCMP at 1:40 a.m. on a roadside screening test. At 1:42 a. m. a roadside test was performed and the accused failed the roadside screening. As result the officer made a demand that the accused provide a breath sample pursuant to s254(3). The accused stated that he understood that the demand was made because he had failed the test. He also stated that there was no process to track cases and when they are concluded, as he may have been advised of his right to counsel at the time. HELD: The defence application was dismissed. 1)The accused's evidence was straightforward and reliable. The only reason the Court had to enter a stay of proceedings and award costs was because the Crown failed to produce the standard alcohol solution as requested by the defence.  2)The defence sought to have the accused's s. 7, s. 8, s., s. 9, s.(1) of The Queen and R. v. Scott dismissed. 3)It is the essence of the Crown's case is the results of the analyses of the breath samples of the accused, which results are obtained from breathalyzer machines. It is obvious that such machines cannot be subjected to cross-examination and that its veracity will never be in question. However, it does not follow that its accuracy is immune from attack. An integral component of any analysis is the solution contained in the ampoules. If the solution is deficient it will produce an inaccurate reading. There is no reason the accused was not transported to Saskatoon and not to the Martensville or Warman detachment for the purposes of testing. The request was made in timely fashion, not for purposes of delay and with a genuine desire to have them conducted. The requested production of ampoule(s) was to be delivered to the accused within 30 to 45 minutes of the officer arriving at the detachment. The officer did not give the accused the toll free Legal Aid number at which legal advice might be obtained.  4)Although the defence requested production, it was not necessary that this be a 'live issue' or that it follow that failure to produce standard alcohol solutions calls for a judicial stay in proceedings and costs."
3_1991canlii4569.txt,"The appellant appealed his conviction for sexual assault using a weapon and his sentence of eight years. The appellant contended that his counsel had failed to call the complainant's boyfriend as a witness even though he was in the courthouse under a defence subpoena. The appellant also raised on appeal the fact that he had lost his right to a jury trial. He had failed to appear at the jury trial scheduled and a bench warrant had been issued. The Crown had then applied for an order that the appellant was no longer entitled to a jury trial and the record showed that his counsel had agreed to forfeit the right to a jury trial. The appellant contended that his counsel and the Crown both advised him he had lost his right by failing to appear and that he was not told that he could avoid losing his right if he had a legitimate excuse for failing to appear. He put forth the excuse of having had no counsel at the time of the trial. Dismissing the appeal, (1) that there was nothing to show that the witness would have given relevant evidence bearing on a decisive issue in the trial and the appellant failed to meet the burden of showing that the evidence, if believed, could reasonably have been expected to affect the result of the trial when considered with all the other evidence; counsel's decision not to call the witness where the witness was hostile and counsel did not know what he would say was not inappropriate, and, the court noted, in the circumstances, seemed to have been the right decision; (2) the excuse of failing to appear because he did not have counsel was not a legitimate excuse within the meaning of s. 598(1)(a) of the Criminal Code; moreover, the appellant only raised this issue in his oral submissions and gave no notice to the Crown respecting this issue nor did he provide any supporting evidence by way of affidavit; it was seen by the Court as another unsupported and unjustified criticism of counsel and the Court concluded that the record showed that the appellant had agreed to forfeit his right to a jury trial; and (3) that an eight year sentence, although at the high end of the scale for sexual assault, was not manifestly excessive, having regard to deterrence, the circumstances of the offence, and the appellant's record which included three minor offences.","The appellant was convicted after trial of assault with a weapon. He applied for leave to appeal against sentence and to have the firearms prohibition order lifted. Dismissing the appeal, that the appellant's evidence would be insufficient to show that the guilt of the appellant had been established beyond a reasonable doubt. Furthermore, there was no evidence that the complainant's consent was violated. Allowing the appeal and allowing the appeal to proceed, that there was a reasonable probability that, but for the errors of defence counsel, the appellant would have been found guilty."
b_1995canlii6027.txt,"The accused appealed her conviction on a charge of impaired driving. The grounds of her appeal were that the trial judge erred in determining that she was impaired, and that the trial judge otherwise misconstrued and misapplied the evidence. HELD: Appeal dismissed.  1)Both grounds of appeal raised questions of fact. Findings of fact are not to be reversed on appeal unless it can be established that the trial judge has made some palpable and overriding error which affected her assessment of the facts. 2)The Court's task is not to retry the case or substitute its own decision. A trial judge's findings of fact can only be overturned if they are so clearly wrong as to make the decision unreasonable. 3)The Court was unable to say that an error of that kind was made by the trial judge in this case.","The appellant appealed her 1993 conviction for operating a motor vehicle while impaired contrary to s. 253(a) of the Criminal Code. The conviction was based on the law, the evidence and weight of the evidence; an error was made in law in determining the degree of impairment by alcohol or drug required before aconviction could be entered; the appellant had not shown an error by the trial judge on question of law as provided in s. 686(1)(a)(ii). The appeal was therefore dismissed."
4_2009skca44.txt,"The respondent Homeowners sued the respondents Sebastian and the TWC alleging negligence or breach of contract for failing to obtain the coverage for insurance as instructed by the Homeowners. Sebastian and TWC issued a third party claim against the appellant SGI and claimed SGI was negligent or in breach of contract or contributory negligence pursuant to the Contributory Negligence Act for failing to issue a policy of insurance in accordance with the application submitted to SGI by Sebastian on behalf of the Homeowners. The trial judge concluded Sebastian and TWC were negligent and liable for the loss suffered by the Homeowners. Further, the trial judge concluded that the insurer, SGI, owed a duty of care to both Sebastian and TWC and the Homeowners to properly underwrite and deal with the application for insurance. The trial judge concluded SGI contributed equally to the Homeowners' loss by 'their negligent acts' and was responsible to pay 50% of the judgment. The negligence of Sebastian and TWC is not disputed in this appeal. The Homeowners have been paid the amount owed under the judgment and advised they have no interest in the matter and did not participate in the appeal. SGI appeals and submits the trial judge erred in determining that SGI: (a) owed a duty of care to the insureds, Homeowners, and to the broker when it received an application for insurance in 'all the circumstances'; and (b) breached its duty of care. HELD: That portion of the judgment finding that SGI is liable for 50% of the damages payable to the Homeowners is set aside and the Third Party Claim is dismissed. Accordingly, the appeal is allowed with costs to the Appellant. The trial judge correctly placed the duty of care on the intermediary, Sebastian. It is clear the insurer relies on the broker to apply for the coverage in accordance with his clients' (i.e., the insureds') wishes and needs. There was no other evidence before the Court to establish the standard of care, the basis for imposing a duty at law where none has previously existed, or the subsequent breach of that duty by the insurer, SGI, in connection to the application for insurance submitted by Sebastian. The Court concluded there was nothing in this transaction which warrants the creation of a duty of care owed by the insurer to a broker applying for insurance on behalf of his clients.","The applicant prepared a HomePak Application on behalf of the respondents. The Homeowners signed and he submitted to SGI the standard 'comprehensive perils' home coverage policy with Fine Arts Rider for the Swarovski collection with an estimated value of approximately $9,950. The respondents made a claim under their house insurance policy under which SGI denied coverage on the basis of the exclusion in the policy; the loss was due to an accidental breakage which did not constitute 'listed peril' as defined in the coverage policy. SGI issued a third party claim against the respondents, claiming that SGI was negligent or in breach of contract or contributory negligence pursuant to the Contributory Negligence Act for failing to issue a policy of insurance to the them. The trial judge found that SGE contributed equally to the Homeowners' loss by 'their negligent acts' and to advise the insured of the consequent gap in coverage. HELD: Appeal allowed. Even though the respondents wanted insurance coverage for the accidental breakages of their collection, the appellant was never aware that such coverage was available or that their prior policy with SGI, written by McCallum Hill, provided this coverage by way of a'manual narrative'. The appellant contributed equally by his negligent acts to the loss sustained the Draders. There is no general duty on SGI to cover SGI. The respondent was properly advised of the coverage available by the insurance company and made aware of the special coverage available. The findings of negligence by the trial judge are supported by the evidence. The appellant was correctly placed the duty of care on the intermediary, as he gathered the information from the respondents and reviewed the existing coverage, which he could easily have done by carefully reviewing a copy of their previous policy. In either case, that would no doubt have prompted him to ensure that the application for renewal coverage that he completed for the respondents would have very specifically referred to the special scope of coverage being applied for."
8_2010skqb467.txt,"Employees were entitled to wage adjustments under the collective bargaining agreement. The plaintiff union brought an application for an interlocutory injunction requiring the defendant to pay employees who were retiring in 2010 their wage adjustments in the current calendar year. This was an issue because it would affect pensions and retirement dates. In the alternative, the union argued the employer should pay the entitlements before the year end on a 'best approximation' basis or be required to proceed to an expedited arbitration. The defendant brought a motion to strike or dismiss the plaintiff's motion under Queen's Bench Rules 99 and 173 on the basis that the issues raised were terms and conditions of the employment contract and outside the jurisdiction of the Court according to the terms of the collective bargaining agreement. HELD: The defendant's application was dismissed because the Court has residual discretionary jurisdiction to grant relief not available under a statutory arbitration scheme. The plaintiff's application for an injunction was also dismissed. While there may be a serious issue to be tried, the pleadings do not set forth a strong prima facie case. While there might be some irreparable harm to some employees, in general terms the losses can be dealt with through damages. It would be impossible for the defendant to meet a deadline two weeks away because of the complexity of the calculations. It is not appropriate to grant an injunction requiring the defendant to make payment before the end of 2010 and it is not reasonable to make payments based on best approximation. The Court has no jurisdiction to force arbitration on the parties.","The plaintiff union represents approximately 11,000 health care workers employed by the four defendant regional health authorities. The current collective bargaining agreement (CBA) covers the period April 1, 2008 to March 31, 2012. The formal CBA was not signed until October 2010. The plaintiffs seek a mandatory interlocutory injunction requiring the defendants to make the retroactive adjustment payments before the end of this year. They also seek an order requiring the parties to proceed with an expedited arbitration before an arbitrator appointed by the court. HELD: The motion to strike is dismissed. The court is without jurisdiction to determine the issue pleaded based on the CBA and the Weber principle. The essential character of the issue raised concerns the terms and conditions of employment which, in accordance with the CSBA, were beyond the jurisdiction of the court to comply with and fulfil the retroactivity payments. The defendants have provided abundant evidence that in practical terms the imposition of a deadline less than 2 weeks from now cannot conceivably be met. The Court is not able from their perspective to assess the degree to which mandatory chronological relief will be beyond the ability of the defendants."

The RCMP had to execute a Feeney warrant to locate the complainant in the accused basement. The Crown sought an order declaring the accused a dangerous offender. HELD: The accused was designated a dangerous offender and was sentenced to imprisonment in a penitentiary for an indeterminate period on the conviction pursuant to s. 267(b) of the Criminal Code and received time served on the remaining eight charges. The evidence is conclusive that the offence for which the accused was convicted was a serious personal injury offence. The evidence was conclusive that the accused constitutes a threat to other persons because of his pattern of repetitive behaviour and persistent aggressive behaviour. The accused's First Nation would provide support for the accused but its support system is presently non-existent. The Court rejected the expert opinions recommending a long term offender order as being appropriate.","HELD: The accused was convicted of assault causing bodily harm contrary to s. 267(b) of the Criminal Code and of obstructing justice by dissuading or attempting to dissuade the complainant from testifying. The court found that the accused had a pattern of repetitive behaviours showing failure to restrain his behaviour and likelihood of causing death or injury to other persons. The Crown was only required to prove that the offender had a substantial degree of indifference respecting the reasonably foreseeable consequences to others of his behaviour. It did not have to prove either of those patterns. The accused had been bound by an order under s. 753(a)(i) and (ii) of that Code. The evidence established that the respondent had expressed a desire to leave the community and had not done so, that the Gladue factors must be considered in determining his sentence. The Court found that it had a high threshold to consider in determining whether the respondent should be declared a dangerous offender. The sentencing principles articulated in R. v.

Damages were assessed as follows: $8,500.00 for general damages, $5,000.00 as damages for loss of income and $1,000.00 for loss of ability to perform household tasks. The dolly cart out of view behind the counter was an 'unusual danger' which the defendant knew or ought to have known of and reasonable care was not used to prevent injury. However, the plaintiff failed to look at the floor as his attention was focused on the door. He assumed nothing had changed in the area from the time he entered the premises a few minutes previously. The plaintiff was in commercial premises and should have taken greater care to observe and avoid anything in his path. The plaintiff suffered an injury which restricted his activities for the first five months, to a lesser extent for the following year and to a very limited extent to the time of trial. There was no evidence to support a claim for diminishment of earning capacity.","The plaintiff injured his knee when he tripped over a 'dolly-cart' while attending at the premises of the defendant. The plaintiff had entered the premises to pick lumber for a job and when he returned he was unable to fully participate in the business, as he was forced to hire other employees to perform the work he had performed himself. The defendant argued that the plaintiff should have taken greater care to prevent damage to the persons in the position of him.

Several of the defendants made application to have the plaintiff s solicitor removed as solicitor of record claiming this was a conflict of interest. Dismissing the application, that the test in such circumstances is whether the public represented by the reasonably informed person would be satisfied that no use of confidential information would occur. To do so it must be shown that a solicitor client relationship existed. There must not be a danger of the confidential information coming back to haunt the client. The court found that such a relationship did not exist in this instance. In addition, the applicant must demonstrate that the solicitor received information which is relevant to the matter at hand. The court found no such evidence of this possibility. It is no bar to representation by a solicitor that some former partners at a previous firm will be examined for discovery or called to testify.","The plaintiff obtained and used the services of a former partner of the plaintiff (the plaintiff's former President and Chief Executive Officer) of the defendant.

The defendants applied to have the former president and chief executive officer, both former partners of the defendants, removed as consultants. Dismissing the application, that there was nothing in the former's confidential information about the present affairs of the companies which would have been relevant to the present action. The former president's retainer and the defendant's extensive retainer did not constitute confidential information. The information sought from the defendant and its former directors was neither relevant nor necessary. The merger between the plaintiff and defendant was not an improper or improper conveyance, as the parties clearly had a prior relationship.

The receiver of the shopping centre also brought an application for a declaration that the defendant could not operate a pharmacy on its premises. The defendant objected to the receiver's application on the basis that it involved controverted issues of fact requiring a trial. Application for interim injunction dismissed on the basis that the applicant had not established irreparable harm; the receiver's application could proceed as an application as the potential for a factual dispute was insubstantial; defendant provided with the option of either accepting an adjournment to allow time for further investigation, the conduct of discoveries and the presenting of any further evidence or moving for the court's further consideration.","The plaintiff obtained a twenty-five year lease for 22,000 square feet that became a supermarket. The landlord promised to restrict competition by other tenants. The receiver applied for an interim injunction on the basis that the evidence did not establish grounds for a permanent injunction at the required threshold, that the plaintiffs had not established that they would suffer harm not compensable in damages if their escape from the bargain was not granted, and that the balance of convenience favoured the landlord over the sellers. HELD: The application for an injunction was dismissed. The court would not automatically engage in a prolonged examination of the merits just because a breach of a negative covenant is alleged. There was no evidence of a mistake in the expression of the terms, there was no dispute as to the lease amendments, and the essential aspects of the conduct alleged to constitute breach were known and uncontraverted. The case for the receiver was simpler than that for the landlord and M.C. LeBlanc because the landlord is party to the Sobeys lease and is entitled to enforce the lease as a party. Unencumbered by the standing issues, the factual complication of the receiver's case is to be assessed simply in light of the lease terms and the conduct which is alleged to be breach of those terms. There is no suggestion of ambiguity over contractual context."
d_2000skca131.txt,"The Crown sought leave to appeal the sentence of 2.5 years for manslaughter on the grounds it was not proportionate to the gravity of the offence and failed to meet the requirements of deterrence and denunciation. HELD: A sentence of 5 years of imprisonment was imposed. The sentence was set aside because it did not comply with the fundamental principle of sentencing that it be proportionate to the gravity of the offence nor achieved the objective of denunciation of crimes of this nature. The manslaughter resulted from a common criminal enterprise, planned in advance, and was expected to be violent. The accused pled guilty, had no criminal record, did not participate in the actual physical beating and stabbing of the victim who died from the wounds or of the other victim; she intervened to stop the beating although only after being satisfied the alleged the drug dealer had nothing to give the robbers.  The accused appeared to be doing well in the prison programs. The sentence of the co-accused who had a record of 40 previous convictions had been increased to the equivalent of more than 10 years imprisonment.","HELD: The appeal was allowed. The sentence of 2½ years was increased to the equivalent of more than 10 years. The Crown sought leave to appeal the sentence on the grounds that it was not proportionate to the gravity of the offence and failed to meet the requirements of the law in respect of deterrence, denunciation and separation. The 18 year old complainant who was charged with manslaughter and the third man who was never identified were sentenced to 5 years imprisonment. The appellant appealed the sentence of the trial judge who effectively reduced the sentence by imposing a sentence of two years imprisonment without parole. The mitigating factors were that the complainant had no criminal record; she did not participate in the actual physical beating and stabbing of the victims and stopped the beating of the robbers, albeit only after she seemed satisfied that he had nothing to give the robbers; and she seemed to be doing well in all programs in prison."
5_2010nspc18.txt,"The on-site supervisor was convicted of two offences under the Fall Protection and Scaffolding Regulations (failing to ensure a guardrail was installed at the perimeter of the work area and failing to ensure that an intermediate or 'mid' guardrail was installed) after a mason was killed when he fell from scaffolding on the job site. Prior to the mason beginning work for the day and the supervisor temporarily leaving the site, he had told another employee to install a 'mid' guardrail but no such rail was in place when the mason fell. The court found that having decided to use guardrails, the defendant was required to make certain that those guardrails were, in fact, constructed in the manner prescribed in the regulations and to supervise and inspect the scaffolding before work was undertaken, no matter the experience level of his crew. In regard to the first count, what the supervisor thought might be a substitute for part of a proper guardrail system did not comply with the regulations. The defendant will donate $2,000 to the Public Education Trust Fund and make 18 presentations at various venues over the next 18 months; he will appear in court on a specified date to provide a status report on his progress in this regard. This was not a case of reckless disregard or deliberate indifference to the legislated safety measures and the defendant's degree of moral blameworthiness was at the lower end of the continuum as he neither created nor negligently left in place a hidden hazard. Both the actions of another workman and the deceased's own actions had contributed to the fall.","The defendant was found guilty of failing to ensure that a guardrail was installed at the perimeter or open side where a person was exposed to a hazard of falling, contrary to s. 7(1) and 9(1)(b) of the Fall Protection and Scaffolding Regulations and in both cases, he committed an offence contrary to S. 74(1(a)) of the Occupational Health and Safety Act. The defendant was fined $250,000 for failing to properly supervise and inspect the guardrails before work commenced in that area. He also received a $500,000 fine for failure to properly inspect the scaffolding prior to work commenced. In assessing the appropriate sentence, the court found that the defendant had a high degree of moral blameworthiness and that he made an error in believing that the steel I-beam supporting the roof overhang could substitute as a top-rail. This was more than a mere slip in judgment; it was a serious failure in the defendant's implementation of its safety regime."
b_2018skca65.txt,"HELD: The appeal was allowed and a new trial ordered. In this case, the court found that the judge had not erred in his decisions regarding the first and the third requests for adjournment but had in the second request by failing to provide sufficient reasons for his denial. Amongst many factors it considered, the court found that most importantly, the appellant had not caused his counsel to withdraw for the purpose of delaying trial. It concluded that the error resulted in a miscarriage of justice based upon the appellant’s poor conduct of his own defence and lack of understanding of trial process.","HELD: The appeal was allowed and a new trial ordered. The court found that the trial judge's refusal to grant an adjournment deprived the accused of his right to make full answer and defence and to fair trial. It also found that, in the course of the trial, the accused's counsel had justifiably withdrawn, leaving the accused to conduct his own defence. The issues were whether the judge's decision to grant the adjournment was based on reasons not wellfounded in law and whether the decision affected the accused’s right to a fair trial or to a presumption that the accused was involved in a deliberate plot to delay the trial."
5_2005nssc172.txt,"The parents applied for leave to apply to terminate a permanent care and custody order respecting their three children. Proposed Notices of Adoption were filed for two of the children after the parents' application was filed but before it was heard. The order had been made due to, inter alia, issues of poor hygiene and nutrition; lack of supervision; domestic disputes; physical risk to the children due to inappropriate discipline; the mother's explosive temper and mental health; the father's anger; lack of insight, desire or inability to improve by the parents; inability to control themselves during access or exercise access meaningfully and an all-consuming anger and preoccupation with the Agency. Since the order was made, the mother was diagnosed with and now receiving medication for bipolar and obsessive compulsive disorders. Application for leave granted; access not ordered at the present time; supplemental affidavits and viva voce evidence were considered given that the parents had only obtained counsel after the application was filed and the nature of the issue at stake; the application could not be arrested simply because the Agency had taken steps to have the children adopted after the application was filed. Some of the factors leading to the permanent care order were being addressed by the parents, although they had not been fully dealt with; the main achievements so far appeared to be an improvement in the parents' relationship, the courses of counselling and parenting instruction they had embarked upon, an expressed willingness by the mother to undertake psychotherapy, the mother's diagnosis and medication and the parents' changed attitude towards cooperation with the Agency; these are significant building blocks on which to anchor intense parental counselling","The applicants applied for leave to terminate an order for permanent care and custody respecting their three children. The applicants had been fighting an old war, blaming the Agency for their past. They had placed the children in one home for adoption, because notices of proposed adoption had been given. Counsel for the applicants indicated that they intended to proceed with the application for leave rather than the application to terminate. The Agency opposed the application on the basis that the applicants had not made sufficient progress sufficient to justify granting leave to apply to terminate the order. HELD: The applications for leave were granted. The court found that the evidence from the parenting courses, marriage counselling and parenting counselling was incorrect. The children had been placed in two homes for adoption but there had been ongoing contact between the applicants and their children. Although they had made some positive changes, it was not significant enough to result in improved parenting that would enhance the children's lives. The parents' parenting was abysmal and neither parent appreciated the services offered by the other parenting service. Neither parent believed that the other was the biological father of the children. Both parents were working hard to become better parents and the Court found that both parents were victims of the other's failure to provide the children with the necessities of life, namely parenting. The father had completed anger management training and the mother had completed marriage counselling. The mother had been diagnosed with Bipolar Disorder and obsessive compulsive disorder. She had been unable to manage her anger and depression at the same time. The daughter had ADHD and was unable to learn how to deal with it. The son was diagnosed with ADD and ADHD. He is currently residing with his mother in a new home. The family has been trying to arrange marriage counselling, parenting courses and adoption counselling. Although other parenting services are available through Family Services, they are unlikely to benefit them sufficiently. The child's biological father, who suffers from Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADD), is not recognised as a biological father. The agency opposed the applications to terminate because they believed that they had allowed matters to escalate with the Agency. Neither one had demonstrated any level of cooperation with the other. Both were experiencing significant changes in their lives that required Agency involvement. The Court found it unlikely that either parent would be motivated to make any change necessary to achieve the level of parenting required to become effective parents. Both of the parents were experiencing some of the same problems that the Agency did. Both accused the other of failing to provide stability and appropriate parenting. Both denied any wrongdoing and argued that the"

HELD: The plaintiff was entitled to enter judgment for $15,000 plus costs of this application. A settlement agreement reduced to writing in no way offends the confidentiality required under s.28.1. The plaintiff is entitled to rely on the minutes of settlement and must be permitted to refer to them in his affidavit. Section 28.1 is not meant to apply to this situation. If a party to an action is unable to enforce a concluded settlement, the pre-trial process becomes meaningless. The legislation never intended such a result. There was no suggestion that there was non-disclosure, misrepresentation, duress or fraud in the execution of the minutes of settlement. Nor was it suggested the minutes were unclear or ambiguous. The defendant did not allege the settlement was amended or altered or that the balance of $15,000 does not remain owing.","The plaintiff applied for summary judgment pursuant to Queen's Bench Act s. 184A(1)(a) and s. 29 of The Queen’s Bench Act in accordance with minutes of settlement agreed to by the parties following a pre-trial conference July 16, 2002.

HELD: The plaintiff was granted summary judgment in the amount of $15,000 plus costs taxed to the date of the Minutes of Settlement. 1) The defendant did not file any affidavit material in opposition to the application. 2) The majority of the plaintiff’ affidavit must be struck by reason of the fact that the averments contravene s. 28.1 of The QBR Act, 1998. However this judgment shall not be entered into until the said $20,000 has been paid to my lawyer.  3) The enforceability of the settlement agreement can be determined by reading and interpreting its terms.

c_2003skqb46.txt,"The Attorney General applied to strike out the plaintiff's claims on the grounds they are statute-barred by virtue of the LAA s.3 and that all the claims except for trespass to person are not exempted by s.3(3.1); by POPA s.2; alternatively, the Court has no jurisdiction over any cause of action relating to intentional torts committed by a Crown servant or employee prior to May 14, 1953; all claims arising from the conduct of two deceased Sisters who died in 1988 and 1993 are barred by the TA and SAA. The plaintiff claimed he was physically assaulted by employees and staff and suffered the loss of his traditional language and culture between 1944 and 1952 while attending the Qu'Appelle Residential School. The AG acknowledged the plaintiff attended the school from 1946 until 1949. The AG in a previous application was granted leave to amend its statement of defence and third party claim to plead and rely upon the Crown Liability and Proceedings Act; Limitations of Actions Act ss.31(d),(h) and (j); Public Officers' Protection Act; Trustee Act s.59, or its predecessor legislation Survival of Actions Act s.10; Crown Liability Act s.3(1)(a) and the Exchequer Court Act s.19. A third party claim against the Oblats alleging they controlled and operated the residential school at all material times, was not relevant on this application. HELD: 1)The claim based on physical assault by the Sisters was struck. The Court has no jurisdiction over any cause of action relating to intentional torts committed by a Crown servant or employee prior to May 14, 1953. The Crown remains immune from claims for trespass, assault and battery committed by servants and officers before the enactment of the Crown Liability Act in 1953 (renamed the Crown Liability and Proceedings Act in 1990), which did not operate retroactively. The LAA s.3(3.1) does not create a cause of action but simply removes statutory time limitation periods barring otherwise existing actions. Before May 14, 1953 the Crown was subject to claims for negligence pursuant to the Exchequer Court Act s.19(c). The Dyson procedure is available in Canada in every jurisdiction except New Brunswick and Nova Scotia. 2)The claim based on negligence is subject to the two year time limitation prescribed by LAA s.3(1)(d) which must calculated having regard to the principles of discoverability. 3)The claims of breach of trust and breach of fiduciary duty are equitable claims subject to the six year time limitation in LAA ss.3(1)(h) which explicitly begins to run from the discovery of the cause of action (PG v. AG Canada). Relevant factual issues are to be dealt with at trial. 4)Even though the claim in trespass is based on acts alleged to have occurred over 50 years ago, it clearly falls within the class of actions contemplated by LAA s.3(3.1)(b)(ii). As such it is also exempted from any limitation period against others liable for the conduct. 5)The argument that the 12 month limitation period in POPA s.2(1)(a) should be applied in priority to the more general provisions of the LAAA was rejected in RJG v. AG Canada. 6)Claims based on direct liability of the Crown for negligence, breach of trust and fiduciary duty are not affected by time limitation periods applicable to the deceased Sister Greyeyes and her estate. The time limitation periods are abrogated by LAA s.3(3.2). Since there is no limitation period barring an action against the Sister or her estate, there can be no provincial limitation period available to the Federal Crown under CLPA s.24. 7)The other claims made directly against the Federal Crown are not affected by limitation periods applicable to Sister Elle or her estate. SAA ss.5 and 10(1),(3) and (4) do not bar the claims against her.  LAA s.3(3.2) abrogates the time limitation in SAA s.10(3)(b).","The plaintiff claims that he was physically assaulted and that he lost his aboriginal language and culture approximately 50 years ago when he was a student at the Residential School. The Attorney General applies to strike the plaintiff's claims on the grounds that they are barred by certain statutes or alternatively that the Court has no jurisdiction over any cause of action relating to an alleged intentional tort committed by a Crown servant or employee prior to May 14, 1953. HELD: 1) The law is clear that the plaintiff cannot pursue a claim against the Federal Crown for the intentional torts committed by its servants and officers occurring prior to or beyond May 14 1953. 2) The language of s. 24(1) of the LAA is clear and its meaning unambiguous. 3) Even if the time limitation period in the POPA applies to claims other than those described in s. 3(3(1)(a), the Court may not be able to establish that the claim is barred by s. 2(3.1) or its successor, the Federal Court Act. 4) The court reviewed the history of jurisdiction over claims against the Crown for matters predating May14, 1953 and concluded that the 12 month limitation period under s.3(3) does not apply. 5) The plaintiff has failed to plead cause of actions that the court has jurisdiction to entertain. 6) Even with the time restriction period in s.(3)(3) set aside under the Exchequer Court Act or the Federal Courts Act, time begins to run under s2(1(a) of that Act only when the alleged injury or damage ceases. There is no agreement as to when that alleged injury and damage ceased. That is a factual matter to be dealt with at trial."
c_1996canlii6986.txt,"A Director was charged with professional misconduct for coercing the resignation of two principals in his school division. The Discipline Committee found the appellant guilty of misrepresenting the school process report involving the first principal and of threatening the other principal that if he did not apply for a transfer and resign the matter would be dealt with at the board table and that 'it could get ugly'. The Executive Committee of LEADS issued a reprimand to be placed on his file for five years and a fine of $2,500. At issue was whether the Discipline Committee erred in its findings of fact and the burden of proof, whether the facts, if true, constituted professional misconduct and whether the penalty imposed was excessive. HELD: Appeal dismissed.  1)The legislation does not appear to call for a change in the traditional approach. The fact that an appellate judge can substitute his or her decision for that of the Discipline Committee or order of an executive does not mean that the appellate court's view of the facts and credibility of witnesses supercedes in any way the role of the Discipline Committee unless it finds there were inappropriate inferences drawn, conclusions reached which were not supported by the evidence, or a misdirection on a point of law. None were found in either case. The Discipline Committee did not err in its interpretation of 'professional misconduct' or its application to the facts.  2)Section 52 of the LEADS Act and s62 of the Medical Profession Act, 1981 are virtually the same except for minor changes in wording and format. The jurisprudence under the Medical Profession Act was applicable to the standard of review in this case. 3)The penalty imposed was not wrong or unjustified. Section 47 of the LEADS Act gives the Executive Committee wide latitude in the nature of punishment that it may impose upon a person found guilty of professional misconduct. The Executive is not bound by the recommendations of the Discipline Committee. They are only guidelines. 4)The Act is silent as to who shall bear costs of providing the documents filed pursuant to s51(2) of the Act. If the legislature had intended the statutorily mandated costs to be costs in the cause it would have said so. LEADS should bear the costs in this case. In any event pursuant to the court's inherent jurisdiction and pursuant to s52 of the Act the costs of providing the materials were to be borne by the respondent. 5)Subject to the above the respondent was entitled to costs of and incidental to the appeal.ADDENDUM to TWL QB96220.

The Discipline Committee, the Executive Committee and the League of Educational Administrators, Directors and Superintendents upheld the discipline committee's decision. The discipline committee chose to accept the evidence of the appellant over that of the respondent. The issues on appeal were whether the Committee erred in its findings of fact, whether the appellant intentionally misrepresented the substance of the report, whether there was a misdirection on point of law, and whether the conclusions reached by the Committee were so clearly wrong as to make their decision unreasonable. HELD: The appeal was dismissed. 1)The discipline committee was properly constituted in the circumstances. 2)It did not err in its finding of fact as set forth in the grounds of appeal nor in its application of the burden of proof. 3)The Discipline Committee did not engage in the standard of proof set forth herein. The Committee was slow and methodical in applying the standard set forth therein. 4)It was not appropriate to substitute its decision with that of a discipline committee or order of the executive. 5)The party was guilty of one count each of misrepresenting the school improvement process report and of threatening the appellant."

The 32 year old appellant had 32 previous convictions including two armed robberies and seven convictions relating to possession of weapons. HELD: The Crown appeal was allowed and the sentence for each offence was increased to three years imprisonment to be served concurrently. 1)The judge made an error in calculating the time on remand that should have been credited to the sentence. Only six months rather than the whole year should have been counted. 2)Given the appellant's record these offences demanded more than the three year minimum generally imposed.","This was a Crown appeal against two sentences of two years less a day each, to be served concurrently. The sentences were imposed in respect of two convictions for armed robbery. The respondent agreed that the facts of the case were accurately set out in the Crown factum. He negotiated a sale of hash oil to be supplied by the complainant, who was angry that he had been ripped off and returned to confront the respondent. At that point the respondent pulled a knife and threatened the complainant. Eventually the respondent found the money underneath the complainant's bed, which was all that the knife had taken. The appellant took the money and threatened to stab the respondent, who resisted. The knife was not found on the complainant; it was found under the bed of the respondent's roommate. The parties were frightened by the first person's threatening behaviour with the knife and the appellant ran away. He was arrested and was held on Remand for 1 year. The trial judge in this case gave credit of 2 years for the 1 year he believed the respondent had spent on Remanded, and imposed a sentence of 2.5 years less 1 day concurrent on each charge. Some additional facts were not reproduced because they are not relevant to the appeal. The applicant had common law wife, four children from previous unions, and an aged mother who is at least partially dependent on him. He had been on Remond the entire time being one year. Taking into account all the factors, this was a very unpremeditated robbery, which should have met the minimum sentence for all the offences. Taking all the into account, this should have made a total of three years less one day concurrent."
c_2012nssc46.txt,"The parties agreed on discovery dates and the order in which witnesses would be discovered. As a result of an honest error, the defendant wasn't able to attend the original dates. The plaintiff became frustrated and concerned about further delays. While the defendant was making good faith efforts to resolve the discovery issues (including whether its witnesses should be excluded from attending discovery of the plaintiff's witnesses), the plaintiff's lawyer issued discovery subpoenas to compel the defendant's witnesses to appear, making the exclusion issue moot. The defendant moved to have the subpoenas dismissed, and sought solicitor and client costs on the motion. The defendant argued the subpoenas were improper and an abuse of process, and accused the plaintiff's lawyer of making unwarranted attacks against the defendant's lawyer in his pre-hearing brief. The motion was heard over approximately one-half day. Motion granted. The plaintiff will pay total costs of $2,550 (plus disbursements) to the defendant, consisting of $1,500 in party and party costs under Tariff C and $1,050 in solicitor and client costs. The tariff amount of $1,000 is increased by $500 to reflect the fact the issuance of the subpoenas was an improper step, albeit one falling short of an abuse of process. It required the defendant to bring this motion to strike. The plaintiff was given a chance to withdraw the subpoenas and chose not to. Solicitor and client costs were warranted especially in light of the defendant's lawyer's language, which was unduly harsh and unnecessarily strong. His allegations added a layer of complexity and seriousness to the case, which caused the defendant to spend extra time preparing a response. Lawyers are officers of the court and the court must encourage them to use courtesy, respect and professionalism.","The defendant filed a motion to dismiss discovery subpoenas issued to its witnesses. The motion was allowed and the order granted included a direction as to the manner of discovery. The defendant argued that the issuance of the subpoenas was an improper and mistaken use of discovery subpoena and that the discovery process was in breach of the Rules. The plaintiff sought to increase the tariff for party/party costs by $500 as it alleged that the defendant's representative was excluded from the discovery hearing and that there would be further unreasonable delays. Defendant seeks to increase costs on a solicitor/client basis. The parties positions on discovery, when they would be held and in particular the order in which the witnesses will be examined were entrenched. The case law is applicable in that corporate defendant has a right to be represented at discovery. On the merits, whether there was implicit agreement regarding the discovery in July, when this agreement fell through, the plaintiff became frustrated and became concerned about further delay resulting in the discovery examination. In exercising the inherent jurisdiction of the court, the court reviewed the factors in increasing costs. The court found that the actions of the defendant in seeking to exclude its representative were improper, mistaken and unnecessary. It ordered further increases in the tariff range as necessary to protect credibility. Further increases were ordered in the amount of $1,000 for party-party costs in the range of $500 given in the decision of the parties."
4_2016skqb136.txt,"Family Law – Custody and Access – InterimThe petitioner and the respondent had four children during the course of their marriage. They separated in 2010 and the petitioner applied for interim orders, including arrangements for the parenting of the children. The court made an interim order that the parties would have joint custody with the primary residence of the children to be with the petitioner. The respondent would have access at reasonable times and on every other weekend. The parties reconciled for two years but then separated again. In 2012 the petitioner applied for an order enforcing the 2010 interim custody order. At that application, the court found that both parents were capable of parenting, but in the short term it confirmed terms of the 2010 order. A number of pre-trial conferences were held without resolving matters, and during that time, the parenting arrangements changed substantially. The oldest child began residing with the respondent in December 2014. In December 2015, the second oldest child began residing with the respondent. They stayed with the petitioner on alternate weekends. The applicant then brought this application for an order pursuant to ss. 23(1)(a) and (e) of The Children’s Law Act and pursuant to the 2012 court order, confirming the original interim order that the four children of the marriage have their interim primary residence with her and that the respondent have specified parenting time on one day each week and alternating weekends. The petitioner alleged that the respondent was attempting to influence the two youngest children to reside with him. HELD: The court ordered that the status quo parenting arrangement should remain in place until trial. In this case, the status quo was not the arrangements as they had been in 2010 and in 2012. The court found that the arrangements had evolved since the 2010 order by agreement of the parties and the changes had not occurred because the respondent was attempting to alienate the children from the petitioner.","Three days after the parties separated, the petitioner filed an application for interim orders dealing with, but not limited to, the parenting of the children and the division of family property. The application was adjourned sine die to be brought back on 7 days' notice to the respondent. HELD: 1)The application was dismissed. 2)The court found that the application was not in any way intended to fetter a different conclusion based on evidence that may be available at trial. 3)The parenting arrangements for the children have evolved over the years. The respondent has engaged in parental alienation. The petitioner has not brought a formal application to change the previous interim order. Given the short notice, the court had little opportunity to do so. One option would be to adjourn the petitioner's application to enable her to make this application more quickly and with less time to deal with the issue."

He appealed, arguing his s. 9 Charter rights had been violated. He also contended the evidence of the amount of alcohol he had consumed on the night in question constituted 'evidence to the contrary' which rebutted the presumption in s. 258 of the Criminal Code. Dismissing the appeal, that the police officers were not acting arbitrarily or in a random fashion when they detained the appellant, and had a reasonable basis for stopping his vehicle. The appellant's contention he consumed only two small bottles (1-1/2 ounces each) of rum, plus some cough syrup and mints, did not constitute evidence to the contrary to rebut the presumption of the breathalyzer offence. On Appeal.","The accused was arrested for impaired driving, read a breathalyser demand and gave him the usual Charter of Rights warning. The next day, the accused was observed entering a nearby building and driving off with his wife in his vehicle. The two officers stopped the vehicle and noticed the accused's vehicle being driven in an irregular or improper manner. The accused was then taken to the police van, where he was given the usual two breathalysers tests. At trial, the police officer was convicted of impaired driving. Included in the defence's evidence was his statement that he had had two drinks at another location prior to going to the alleged after hours club and that he stated that it should result in a reading significantly less than the alcohol concentration forbidden under s. 258 of the Code. The Crown appealed the conviction, arguing that the Provincial Court judge erred in law by admitting evidence obtained by the police as result of the Charier contravention. Dismissing the appeal, that the trial judge was not in error in law or in her finding of facts in her decision. The trial judge applied the proper principles of law to the facts of the particular case in excluding evidence. The first ground dealt with whether the evidence of the amount of alcohol consumed and the extent that it might have constituted 'evidence to rebut' the presumption of s. s.258 of the Criminal Code. HELD: The appeal was dismissed. 1)The police officers involved were not acting arbitrarily or in a random fashion. They, in fact, had advanced a reasonable basis and had an articulable cause for stopping the vehicle.  2)The trial judge did not err in law in refusing to give effect to the opinion that the respondent's blood-alcohol level was within the permitted limits. It was at most evidence from which court might conclude that that level could at the time of the alleged offence have been different from the level in the certificate. In the fact situation before me, it is clear that the police officers in question applied the correct principles of Law in relation to the evidence and evidence of alcohol consumption."

It was clear from the trial judge's acceptance of the evidence of the two paramedics who had noted the car parked in an unusual place and police officer who came along later, that he rejected the theory advanced by the appellant's counsel. The location of the ignition key was not relevant. The appellant's memory of the events was far from clear given the level of his intoxication. The trial judge was entitled to accept and rely on the evidence of the Crown witnesses.","The accused was convicted of having consumed alcohol in such a quantity that the blood alcohol concentration in his blood exceeded.08 contrary to s. 253(b) and s. 255(1) of the Criminal Code. HELD: The appeal was dismissed. 1)It was clear from the learned trial judge's acceptance of the evidence of the ambulance attendants and that of the police officer who came along later that he rejected the theory the appellant's counsel advanced. He was perfectly entitled to reject the theory. The location of the ignition key was not relevant, given the fact it was located somewhere on the right side of the steering wheel. The accused had much different story. He thought the vehicle was running when he woke up but the learned judge clearly accepted the testimony of the EMS attendants and police officer over the accused's version of what took place. 2)The learned judge was entitled to accept and rely on the evidenceof the ambulance and police officers over the account of what happened."
c_2009skca53.txt,"The three respondents pled guilty to three offences: trafficking in cocaine for the benefit of, or at the direction of, or in association with a criminal organization contrary to s. 467.12 of the Criminal Code; conspiring together and with others to traffic in cocaine contrary to s. 5(1) of the Controlled Drugs and Substances Act and s. 465(1)(c) of the Criminal Code; and trafficking in cocaine contrary to s. 5(1) of the Controlled Drugs and Substances Act. On the last two counts, each was sentenced to 1 year less a day to be served in the community on each count, to be served concurrently, plus a 10 year fire arms prohibition. On the first count, each was sentenced to serve 1 year, in the community, consecutive to the sentences for the other counts. They were also subjected to DNA orders and there was an order of forfeiture of a vehicle belonging to a third party. The Crown appealed these sentences on the grounds that the sentencing judge failed to give proper effect to the gravity of these offences. The Court weighed all the evidence and circumstances of the accused, and found the sentencing judge was clearly moved by the personal circumstances of the accused and while they are mitigating and would normally justify a sentence at the low end of the range, it was the Court's view that the sentencing judge gave them undue weight in comparison to the principles of denunciation and general deterrence, which must play a significant role in offences of this nature. The Court further stated the 1 year sentence for the trafficking offence, to be served in the community, was demonstrably unfit given the range of sentences established in other cases of trafficking offences, even after taking into account the mitigating personal circumstances of these offenders. The Court found the sentences must be set aside. The Court found that an appropriate sentence for each of the respondents, taking into account the seriousness of the offences, the personal circumstances of the respondents, and the aggravating nature of the offences pursuant to s. 467.12, would be 18 months, concurrent, for each of the last two counts, and 1 year consecutive for the criminal organization offence, for a total of 30 months imprisonment. HELD: The total sentence in each case is 30 months, 5 months having already been served.","The three respondents pled guilty to three offences: trafficking in cocaine for the benefit of, at the direction of, or in association with a criminal organization, to be served concurrently, plus a 10 year fire arms prohibition; conspiring together and with others to traffick in cocaine contrary to s. 5(1) of the Controlled Drugs and Substances Act and s. 465(1)(c) for the other counts; and trafficking with intent to sell cocaine for profit contrary to ss. 5 (1) and 5(5(1)). They were also made subjects to DNA orders and there was an order of forfeiture of a vehicle. HELD: The sentences imposed were 30 months concurrent for each of the last two counts, and 1 year consecutive for the criminal organization offence, for a total of 30 months imprisonment. The respondents had already served five months of the conditional sentence imposed by the sentencing judge for which they were given credit. The total sentence in each case was 30 months, 5 months having already been served. The reasons for the reduction in sentence were summarized in R. v. Brewer (1999), 141 C.C.C (3d) 290 (Ont. C.A.)."
d_1995canlii5746.txt,"When Davidson, Sr. sold his farm to his son he retained the right to continue receiving the rentals arising from four surface leases which he had previously granted to oil companies in respect to producing oil wells. The son granted an option to purchase to the plaintiff which was exercised and a fee simple title was issued in 1973 subject to encumbrances including caveats protecting the surface leases. There was no reference to the rent charge reserved or excluded by the option agreement. The plaintiff asserted that whatever rights arose from the option agreement were merged in the transfer and effectively disappeared upon the registration of the transfer and the issuance of a new unencumbered title. HELD: Declaration denied. Plaintiff's action dismissed with costs. 1)The absence of a caveat protecting the rent charge has had no affect because of the plaintiff's continued ownership of the property.  2)Rarely, if ever, has there been a case where, as here, a purchaser has contracted to obtain the property under an instrument clearly accepting the unregistered equitable interest, then has obtained a fee simple title, then has permitted the unregistered interest to continue unimpeded for 15 years and then, perhaps tiring of the inconvenience of the lease and thinking that the money would be useful, has decided to seek an order of this Court terminating the other interest and directing that it be paid to him. His counsel made no suggestion that the plaintiff had a moral claim, it was purely an attempt to secure by legal means that which he had previously agreed to forego. This is a court of equity as well as a court of law and as such it is repugnant that the court be called upon to vest in an applicant an interest which he has heretofore freely recognized to be the property of another, both before and after receiving his transfer under The Land Titles Act. 3)It was apparent that there was no intention that the rent charge would be merged since it was recognized and allowed to continue for 15 years.","When his son, a grandson, granted an option to purchase the plaintiff's farm, he retained the right to continue receiving rentals arising from four surface leases he had previously granted to oil companies in respect to producing oil wells. When his eldest son granted the option to buy the plaintiff in 1973, the title was encumbered by caveats protecting the surface leases but there was no reference to the rent charge reserved or excluded by the option agreement. The land fell into the family of which the plaintiff was son, one who needed to expand his farming operation. The option was exercised and a fee simple title was issued to the plaintiff. He took legal advice in 1985 or 1986 as to his chances of avoiding the reservation in such a way as to assure that he got the money instead of the defendants. He was advised that since he had an unencumbered feesimple title he need not recognize the contractual reservation. HELD: The land was sold to the grandson of a previous owner and his right to purchase back the land were granted with his consent. 1)It was not intended that a registered owner, merely by exhibiting a certificate of title, should be able to escape the performance of contracts he had entered into prior to, contemporaneously with or subsequent to the registration of his interest or to deny trusteeship which may be fastened upon him by law. On its face it appears that the Land Titles Act is only intended to confer indefeasible titles on those who deal with the registered owner and deal with him on the faith of his registered title. It affords no protection to registered owner against equitable rights which he himself has created and is no defence when his own title is attacked by a person rightfully entitled to the land. If a person employed to buy land for another takes the title in his own name, his certificate of titles is not defence against the rightful owner. He is merely trustee for him, and the court will enforce the trusts unless the rights of the bona fide purchaser in the meantime intervene. 2)It is not to be understood that the certificate of name cannot be questioned at all in Court of law. In any event, it was never intended that registered owner merely by showing a certificate would be able, when confronted with a certificateof title, to question the ownership therein set forth. On his face it appeared that the section has the effect of enabling a purchaser to take advantage of the owner of known but unregistered interest in land even in the face of contrary contractual obligation as between the purchaser and his vendor. It is based upon s. 237 of"
d_1995canlii3966.txt,The accused pleaded guilty to a charge of assaulting his 8 year old stepdaughter by slapping her and striking her with a small paddle. The Crown and counsel for the accused agreed that a fine and probation would be appropriate. The trial judge sentenced him to 1 year in prison and 1 year's probation. He appealed his sentence. HELD: Appeal allowed. 1)The force applied was minimal and the child was not injured physically. 2)The sentence imposed would result in the accused losing his employment which would harm his dependents. 3)The Court reduced his sentence to 60 days intermittent.,"The appellant pleaded guilty to the charge of slapping and striking an eight year stepdaughter contrary to s. 266 of the Criminal Code. The Crown and the defence agreed that it was probably an instance where a fine and probation order would create the necessary special deterrence and parental guidance the situation called for. The trial judge was however of the view that the conduct of the accused warranted a more severe penalty. HELD: The appeal was allowed and a sentence of 60 days intermittent be substituted for the sentence of 1 year. The probation order was to remain unchanged except to substitute the word'supervised' for 'adult' in the first condition. 1 year was excessive. The view the trial judge took of the appellant's conduct and accept that some degree of incarceration is appropriate given the position of authority he enjoyed and the existence of his past criminal record even though it does not include similar instances of violence. The sentence of one year under these circumstances, even with the record of The appellant, is excessive. In addition, it will no doubt mean the appellant would lose his current employment upon which the family is reliant. HENDERSON: Appeal allowed. 1)The trial judge must have been influenced to a substantial degree by the lack of parenting skills displayed by the appellant in the way he mistreated and verbally abused the young girl in manner which was demeaning and destructive of her self image. As offensive as that conduct may be, a lack of parental skill does not constitute a criminal offence and the only thing that the appellant pleaded to was an assault which was not severe and produced no injury. 2)The sentence of two years was excessive in this case even with The appellant's record."
6_1997canlii9876.txt,"The respondent was hired as an account manager by the appellant. She did not reach her planned sales goals during her employment, and became depressed. She took six weeks off work on the advice of her doctor. When she returned from sick leave she was dismissed by the appellant, who had already decided to terminate her employment after concluding that she was not able to handle the job. She claimed damages for mental distress for the sudden and callous manner in which she had been dismissed. The jury awarded the respondent $20,000 in lieu of notice and $60,000 damages for mental distress. The appellant appealed the award for mental distress. Per Hallett, J.A., Roscoe, J.A., concurring, allowing the appeal, that the suddenness and callousness of a dismissal does not constitute conduct that gives rise to an actionable wrong separate and apart from the cause of action for the dismissal without notice. Per Freeman, J.A., dissenting, dismissing the appeal, that a degree of mental distress is always likely to accompany the termination of employment. However, when the employer's conduct aggravates the mental distress beyond the degree which can be remedied by agreement or reasonable notice, a right to further damages arises.","The appellant corporation appealed a jury award of $60,000 for mental distress in a wrongful dismissal action brought by the respondent. The appellant had no history of sales in the Atlantic provinces and it was expected that the appellant would provide her with a base salary of $40,000 plus commissions. The sales compensation plan was not changed prior to 1993. The respondent was awarded six months' notice. She was awarded the additional $10,000 due to mental distress as a result of conduct arising out of the dismissal. The trial judge concluded that mental suffering would not have been in the reasonable contemplation of the parties at the time the employment contract was entered into as flowing from the appellant's unjust dismissal. He also concluded that the respondent's conduct pre- and post-expectations of mental distress did not constitute sufficient damages to recover from the wrongful dismissal. Dismissing the appeal, that the jury's assessment of damages for mental suffering was inordinately and disproportionately high."
e_1999skqb268.txt,"The defendant manufactured solarium in Saskatoon which it sold to the plaintiffs in Minnesota. The plaintiffs alleged the solarium was defective, sued and obtained judgment in the Minnesota Court which it now sought to enforce in Saskatchewan. The defendant argued the Minnesota court did not have jurisdiction because at the time the action was commenced he was not 'ordinarily resident' in the state of Minnesota. The defendant was served in Saskatoon with notice of the claim but did not appear or defend the action or surrender to its jurisdiction. HELD: The action was dismissed with costs to be taxed. 1)The defences available to defendant in Saskatchewan where an action is brought to enforce foreign judgment are set out in s.6 of the Foreign Judgments Act. 2)While there may be evidence supporting the conclusion that the defendant was carrying on business in Minnesota, that same evidence does not support the conclusion the defendant was ordinarily resident there. The defendant advertised its business in Minnesota and elsewhere in the United States and employed agents there to sell its product. The logical conclusion was that the address in the city of Minneapolis was a business address. It could be argued that the defendant carried on business in the state of Minnesota but the question was whether the defendant was ordinarily resident in that state. The Foreign Judgments Act reflects real difference in the meaning of 'ordinarily resident' and 'carrying on business'.","The plaintiffs sought to enforce payment by the defendant of judgment for $23,396.03 in US currency awarded to them by Carver County District Court in the First Judicial District of Minnesota. The action was defended on the basis that the defendant was not ordinarily resident in the state of Minnesota and did not appear before the Minnesota court or submit to its jurisdiction. HELD: The plaintiff's action was dismissed with costs to be taxed.  1)The Court reviewed found that the Act reflected the difference between the meaning of the word 'ordinarily resident' and 'carrying on business'. 2)Because the defendant, being defendant in the original action, was ordinarily resident here in Minnesota, the time question raised in s.3(a) needed no further explication. 3)The court was not satisfied that the word ordinarily resident was used in the Act or that the Court had jurisdiction over the defendant because at the time the action was commenced, the defendant did not 'carry on business' as the Act used in this case. The Court was also not satisfied, as the parties did not present in any way submit to the jurisdiction of the Minnesota Court. 4)The case law had reviewed showed that there was a real difference in the meaning and expression of words and the Act reflects that difference."
4_2000canlii3136.txt,"In a trial of liability only, jury found defendants to be entirely responsible for causing motor vehicle accident. Plaintiff was found contributorily negligent and liability was apportioned 57.5% to defendant and 42.5% to plaintiff. Plaintiff suffered significant injuries and plaintiff and spouse applied for interim payment of damages. Application allowed in part; plaintiff awarded $250,000.00 as interim payment; spouse's application denied. Once court is satisfied plaintiff has met threshold requirement of a judgment or admission of liability, it must strive with evidence before it to determine what damages are likely to be recovered by plaintiff and may then order interim payment if it thinks just, within limitation that it not exceed a reasonable proportion of the projected amount. The greater the certainty of the final outcome of liability and the greater the strength of the evidence supporting the damages claim, the higher the proportion of damages that will be advanced. There is nothing which precludes interim payment from being substantial amount in a proper case but court must be cautious to avoid any influence on eventual outcome of damage assessment. Although there had not yet been discovery of plaintiff's doctors or an independent medical exam obtained, the plaintiff's injuries were largely demonstrated by clinically objective medical evidence and there was no evidence of any pre-existing condition. In such circumstances, a substantial sum could be ordered. Neither pre-judgment interest nor costs are to be considered by the court in such an application. The evidence in support of the spouse's application was far too incomplete and had yet to be tested by defendants in discovery. Court could not form opinion on what damages spouse was likely to recover.","The plaintiff was seriously injured in a 1994 motor vehicle head-on collision between two tractor trailers. The issue of liability was severed by an order for judgment taken out in April 2000 as result of which it was found that the accident was caused by the negligence of the defendants. The plaintiff sought an interim payment of $250,000. This amount was reduced by the finding of contributory negligence with damages to be assessed and an obligation to repay medical aid costs expended on his behalf in the amount of $69,148.45. The court was satisfied that the plaintiff was likely to recover some measure of compensation for loss of future earnings given the nature and extent of his injuries and his steady employment record as a truck driver."

On the first appearance in October, 2001, the Crown advised it would proceed by summary conviction. The appellant pled not guilty. Defence argued that, in the absence of evidence to the contrary, it should be inferred that the accused acquiesced or implicitly consented to proceeding by way of summary conviction. Counsel agreed pursuant to s.786(2) to proceed by way of summary conviction and invited the court to treat the agreement as having been in place when the trial began. Both preferred the appeal to be heard in this Court or in the Court of Appeal. The appellant sought to have the conviction set aside on the grounds the verdict was unreasonable and not supported by the evidence; the trial judge failed to properly apply the doctrine of recent possession and did not provide adequate reasons for his decision. HELD: The conviction appeal was dismissed.  1)This Court had jurisdiction to entertain the appeal. The Provincial Court judge had jurisdiction as the trial proceedings did not violate s.786(2). 2)The trial judge did not misconstrue nor misapplied the doctrine of recent possession. The unexplained recent possession of stolen goods standing alone will permit, but not necessarily require, an inference that the possessor was the person who stole the goods. The elements of recent possession must be strictly proven if possession is the only evidence connecting the accused with the theft. Otherwise possession should be considered circumstantial evidence and weighed accordingly. There was no palpable and manifest or overriding error made by the trial judge in weighing the evidence.  3)Criminal Code s.687 appears to permit this Court to set aside the 9 month suspended sentence and to grant a conditional or absolute discharge. However, there was no transcript of the sentencing proceedings except for a few lines. If the transcript is not available, this Court may be reconvened to address the applicability of s.687 and whether it would be appropriate to vacate the sentence and embark on the sentencing process afresh.","HELD: The appeal was allowed and the sentence imposed was set aside. The Provincial Court did not have jurisdiction to proceed with the trial. On appeal it was argued that the question of jurisdiction was misconstrued and misapplied the doctrine of recent possession. The appellant contended that the trial judge failed to provide adequate reasons for convicting the appellant. He relied on the case of R. v. Sheppard, [2002] S.C.R. 869, decision of the Supreme Court of Canada. The substantive distinction in the proceedings was limited to the range of sentencing upon conviction. It was impossible to determine whether the sentencing judge applied correct principles or whether the sentence was excessive or otherwise unreasonable or demonstrably unfit. Both parties preferred that the appeal be heard in Court now or alternatively in the Court of Appeal in preference to having the proceedings in the Provincial Court declared null."

The father sought a declaration declining jurisdiction, or an order for joint custody. HELD: The children had a real and substantial connection with British Columbia and evidence of their best interests was available there. They were not habitually resident in Saskatchewan and had been here only 3 months. They were not living with their mother with the implied consent or acquiescence of their father. The uncontradicted evidence that the mother never had any intention to return to the matrimonial home was accepted. The Court would have declined to exercise jurisdiction in any event pursuant to s.16 since it was more appropriate for jurisdiction to be exercised in BC. The father was directed to forthwith file an undertaking to not disturb the status quo until court authorization has been obtained.","The petitioner sought interim custody, or primary residence of the children, pursuant to s. 6 of The Children's Law Act, 1997. The respondent sought a declaration declining jurisdiction or an order of joint custody pursuant to the Act.

The mother had been employed as a substitute teacher in British Columbia until the time of their son's move in 2000. HELD: 1)The children were habitually resident in Saskatchewan. They were not living with their mother with the implied consent or acquiescence of their father. He delayed in bringing an application for custody due to his mistaken belief that the petitioner was considering reconciliation. Although he learned when he received her affidavit in support of her custody application that she never had any intention to return to the home, he was able to make the assumption that she had left quickly and secretly to prevent him from taking any court proceedings in British Columbia to stop her move. 2)The persons who can attest to the professional, social and family circumstances of the boys and their father reside in the province of British Columbia where they have lived all of their lives. It is likely that his teacher, playmates, parents of the young children, school professionals and others, including the psychologist, may be called to testify about facts and circumstances bearing on the children's health.

Before filing a defence the appellants demanded particulars of the alleged lost profits. The plaintiff refused to provide particulars and the chambers judge dismissed the appellants' application for an order compelling particulars. ,appeal dismissed; the appellants had not challenged the sufficiency of the pleadings; no case was made out that the appellants required the particulars in order to file a proper defence to the action.

d_2000nsca117.txt,"Liability was admitted for a very mild rear end collision. The trial judge found the plaintiff's evidence to be lacking in credibility and found that the collision did not contribute materially to the plaintiff's poor health. It only caused a mild aggravation of her pre-existing and major back problem. The trial judge assessed general damages at $25,000. The plaintiff's costs were reduced on the basis that she refused a formal offer to settle for slightly less than what she was awarded and refused a second offer which was increased before trial to an amount in excess of what she was awarded. The plaintiff appealed and the defendant cross-appealed. Appeal and cross-appeal dismissed. No strong and cogent reasons were advanced to warrant interference with the trial judge's findings on credibility. There was ample evidence to support the conclusion that the accident only caused a mild aggravation of the pre-existing condition and thus no basis upon which court could interfere with that conclusion or adjust upwards general damage assessment. Trial judge applied no wrong principle in exercising discretion to reduce plaintiff's costs. Award of $25,000 was not so far outside range of damages for like cases as to be considered wholly erroneous estimate of damages.","At the heart of this appeal is the finding of the trial judge that the accident in question did not contribute materially to the appellant's present poor health, and that the incident caused only a mild aggravation of his pre-existing, and major, back problem. The appeal and cross appeal both dismissed with costs. The Appeal and Cross Appeal both dismissed without costs as per the terms of the judgment. The appellant is essentially asking this court to set aside the trial court's credibility findings against him, to take a different view of the medical evidence than did the trial Judge, and to attribute a larger percentage of the appellant’s present health problems to the accident, with correspondingly higher assessment of damages against the respondent. There was ample medical evidence to support the trial judges conclusion that the automobile in question didn’t contribute in a material way, tothe appellant”s present medical problems, and there is no basis, in law, upon which we should be able to interfere with that conclusion.

The former registered representative of TFPG was terminated for selling unapproved investments in breach of a Shareholder Advisor Agreement which permitted the sale of TFPG's financial products and services only. TFPG sought an interim mandatory injunction requiring the respondent to return all materials and files respecting TFPG's clients, to cease any contact with its clients, and to make no attempt to solicit any current or prospective client. HELD: The respondent was ordered to immediately cease all contact with TFPG clients whose account the respondent, or anyone associated with him, had administered with a view to soliciting or directing a client, affiliate or associate away from TFPG. The restriction would not prevent a client or prospective client from engaging in any business with the respondent nor was he prevented from advertising his services. 1)It was agreed that the respondent should return all of TFPG's files and materials with a right to make and keep a copy.  2)TFPG abandoned the relief sought respecting solicitation of any business of any nature similar to that of TFPG from any TFPG client or prospective client. 3)The agreement merely set out the terms both parties agreed to for valuable consideration. It was not unconscionable nor against public policy. The respondent had warranted that he had an opportunity to seek independent legal advice prior to signing the agreement. The applicant met the test for injunctive relief but the relief as set out in the draft order was too restrictive and denied others freedom of choice as to which party they wished to deal with. 4)A contractual right to injunctive relief is only one factor. The applicant must establish that the right to interlocutory injunction is clear; there is a serious question to be tried and a strong prima facie case; that irreparable harm will result; if there is a doubt as to whether there is an adequate remedy in damages there must be a determination, on a balance of convenience, which party is likely to suffer a greater harm.","FIAT. The plaintiff sought an interim mandatory injunction requiring the defendant to deliver all files, documents, plans, software and other TFPG related material respecting clients of the defendant. The defendant had entered into a Shareholder Advisor Agreement with the applicant whereby the respondent agreed to sell and represent only the applicant's financial products and services which the applicant approved. In exchange for this the respondent received commissions from the applicant. It is alleged the respondent sold unapproved investments of the applicant and as result he was terminated pursuant to the agreement.

In addition to numerous clauses in the agreement setting out the rights and obligations of the parties, the agreement agreed that the breach by him of any provision may cause the company great and irreparable injury and damage which cannot be reasonably or adequately compensated in damages in any action in law and the contractor is entitled to the remedies of an injunction, specific performance and other equitable relief to prevent breach or recurrence of the breach."
b_2011nssc75.txt,"After a piece of family property was divided into two parcels, one of the brothers continued to use a driveway and maintain a garden on the other parcel. When this brother died, his son continued to use the driveway and garden, even after the second property changed hands many times. When the current owners of the second property refused to allow the continued use of their property, the son claimed that his use of the driveway was of right on the basis of expressed reservation or prescription. He argued that his uncle was incompetent when he executed a statutory declaration stating that the use of both the driveway and the garden had been with his express permission. Judgment for the defendants; there was no express reservation of the driveway in the deed to the second property and the plaintiff did not have a prescriptive right to use the driveway. Although the plaintiff and his father had used the driveway in a continuous, uninterrupted and peaceful manner for well in excess of 20 years, the statutory declaration showed that this use had been with the uncle's permission.","Roy Longard, user of the Borden driveway, is securing access to No. Highway over the other driveway in Roy Longard's property. Roy wants to continue to garden on the Keel property and use the Bordens driveway. HELD: 1) The Borden Road was not the original driveway. It was the other one. Roy Longardo, who had obtained the portion of the estate from the Longard brothers and continued to maintain the garden on his own property, did not have a legal right to it at the time of the deed being executed. Neither party was able to use it. Having found the cause of the action and the reasons for the closure, the Court found that the parties had established a prescriptive right-of-way for the use of the Longards for many years prior to the commencement of the Keels' action. This use continued uninterrupted after the brothers had received the land and as long as Borden remained on his property and continued when the property was transferred to the Seventh Day Adventist Church. 2) The plaintiff has not shown that the reservation contained in the 1942 Eldard deed to the extent that it incorporates the Bordenes driveway. There is no expressed reservation shown by the plaintiff herein. The defendant submits that his father used the driveway to access his property from the highway and that it was with the consent of the owner of the servient tenement. This access road is not the only access road to the property. 3) The parties have clearly established that they have joint custody of the land. The Court was satisfied on the basis of the Statutory Declaration that the petitioner has established his right to use the existing driveway and that the defendant has made arrangements to terminate the Defendants' access right of way over the adjacent driveway. 4) The Court concluded that it is not necessary to resolve the issue concerning the burden of proof but necessary to determine the issue of costs."

The accused was charged as the owner of the vehicle, not necessarily the driver. The offence was the result of a speed monitoring camera and the Act allows the Crown to complete their case without calling any witnesses. The accused testified that he did not speed past any highway workers or equipment. He said that he was following a pilot vehicle when he passed the workers and equipment and only sped up after the pilot vehicle turned around when there were no more workers or equipment. The picture of the accused’s vehicle from the speed monitoring camera did not show any highway workers or equipment. HELD: The person who tested and deployed the speed monitoring camera provided affidavit evidence that the picture was taken within a marked construction area but it did not say that the accused was speeding as he was passing highway workers or occupied highway equipment. Section 203(1) specifies that there is only an offence for travelling at a speed greater than 60 km/h when passing highway workers or operating equipment.

The offence under s. 203(1) of the Traffice Safety Act is a strict liability offence and its documentary evidence proves every element of the offence. The only aspect of the Crown's case that the accused disputes is that he passed highway workers and occupied highway Equipment when he was travelling faster than60 kilometres per hour.

He testified that he was driving and that he did not speed past any highway workers nor any highway equipment in the work zone, and that the speed monitoring camera must have photographed his vehicle. The Crown found the accused not guilty. HELD: The accused is found not guilty of trafficking in highway workers. No workers or highway equipment can be seen in the photograph of the accused vehicle. There was no evidence that the Dallyn vehicle was directed or directed at any highway worker or equipment. The speed monitoring device was not operated by the accused. The evidence consisted of a photograph, a SGI Motor Vehicle Division search, an affidavit and the SGI motor vehicle division certified search. There is no evidence of where the accused passed highway machinery or whether it was in motion."
d_2003nssc223.txt,"The testator had prepared his own Will on a pre-printed form and left his assets to his children, whom he then proceeded to name. One of the children predeceased the testator and an application was made for an interpretation of the Will. the gift to the deceased child did not lapse; her estate is entitled to it. The general rule that a lapsed gift falls into the residue is expressly subject to any contrary intention appearing in the will; a class gift always expresses such a contrary intention. Where the gift is to a class of close relatives (e.g. to children), if this is a class gift it does not fall under this statutory exception. In such a case, the gift falls to the surviving members of the class. This case satisfied two of the exceptions to the class rule, namely, that the number of beneficiaries was given and that the names of such were given. The gift was not a class gift but rather a separate bequest to each individual child and no contrary intention was discernible in the Will.","The testator intended to make a separate bequest to each individual child, rather than a class gift. Although there was some evidence that the testator made attempts to change the wording of his will, nothing was properly executed and witnessed. The testator left all of his real and personal estate to his children and grandchildren, except for the jewellry and personal clothing. His will was prepared on a pre-printed stationer's form and he effectively stated that he was leaving his assets to these children. This effectively stated to the children that they were leaving their assets to them. The respondent was simply leaving no doubt as to which Jane, Nancy, Heather, Richard or Greg were referring to. The court was unable to discern a 'contrary intention' in the Will, as Clause 11 does not describe a contrary intention."

The plaintiff locked his brakes and skidded into the defendant, attempting to avoid an accident. Damage to both vehicles exceeded the insurance deductibles and both parties claim damages against each other for the amount of the deductibles. HELD: The plaintiff will have judgment against the defendant in the amount of $50. The defendant will have judgment against the plaintiff in the amount of $450 plus costs. Fault for this accident was attributed 10% to the defendant and 90% to the plaintiff. The defendant had indeed yielded properly but could have been more prudent in insuring that other motorist were aware that she yielded.

b_2007skqb1.txt,"This is an appeal pursuant to s. 39 of The Small Claims Act, 1997. The appellant asserts a palpable and overriding error by the learned trial judge in accepting, and finding as fact, part of the testimony of a witness but not accepting the further testimony of the witness that an amount was also owing to the appellant by the respondent. HELD: The appeal is dismissed. The trial judge was not required to accept the entirety of the witness's testimony, despite having accepted most of it, particularly in light of the contradictory evidence of the respondent denying the sum claimed by the appellant. The denial by the respondent of the appellant's claim, accepted by the trial judge, was fatal to the appellant's onus of proving a mutual understanding and absolute acknowledgement of the alleged debt between the parties.","Appeal pursuant to s. 39 of The Small Claims Act from judgment given January 19, 2006. The appellant asserts a palpable and overriding error by the learned trial judge in accepting, and finding as fact, part of the testimony of witness (that an amount was owing by the appellant to the respondent) but not accepting the further testimony of the witness that an amount is also owing to the appellant by the respondent. The respondent argues that there was no error of law nor unreasonable finding of fact by the trial judge, and that his conclusions are not so clearly wrong as to make the decision unreasonable. HELD: The appeal is dismissed. There is no order as to costs. 1) There was no palpable or overriding error in the judgment. The trial judge was an immense advantage in assessing evidence and arriving at findings of fact. The court of appeal had an immense edge in assessing the evidence and arrive at findings such as this one. This appeal must extend very substantial deference to the findings in fact of a trial judge. The standard of appellate review is that of palpable and overarching error and its functional equivalents, including 'clearly wrong, 'unreasonable' and 'not reasonably supported by the evidence' (see: 2005 SCC 25). That principle of law and case authorities were not before the trial court nor argued on this appeal. 2) There is an absolute evidentiary error, which was not established on the evidence. There was sufficient evidence to establish a mutual acknowledgement of the debt by the parties, despite the fact that the appellant had accepted the amount as being the correct quantum of his counterclaim. The jury was not required to accept the witness's testimony as to the amount owing to him. 3) The conviction was not fit to proceed on appeal. The conviction and acquittal were found to be inimical to the evidence, and there was sufficient jurisprudence to establish the mutual acknowledgement."
d_1999canlii12581.txt,"In issue was whether the Bank breached its lending contract, its fiduciary duty or duty of confidentiality; and if so, what damages, if any, should be awarded. The defendant's bank loans fell into default after SGI disability benefits were terminated. The Bank reported the particulars of the loan defaults to a credit reporting agency (Equifax). The defendant declined to give an assignment of any accident injury settlement he might receive from SGI and requested the bank direct Equifax to eliminate any references to his default or delinquency upon the bank loans. The bank offered to put an explanatory note on their credit report confirming the arrears were the result of the defendant's automobile accident and that he had undertaken to pay the bank from the proceeds of the accident settlement. The bank commenced this action for payment. The Compains sought general, punitive, exemplary and aggravated damages in a counterclaim for breach of the bank's duty of good faith, duty of confidentiality and breach of contract. HELD: The counterclaims were dismissed with taxed costs to the bank for both the claim and counterclaims. The bank's claim was admitted at trial. 1)Compain expressly waived any contractual rights which he had to confidentiality of his credit information by the provisions of paragraph 8 of the Personal Credit Line Agreement. The principles outlined by the English Court of appeal in Tournier enumerated four exceptions to a bank's confidentiality obligation to its customers. 2)The analogy between the insurance cases and a bank and borrowing customer was not complete or appropriate. Assuming, without deciding, that banks do have a duty of good faith and fair dealing towards their customers, the bank did not breach such duties in their dealings in this case. 3)The characterization of the accounts as collection accounts was fair, reasonable and accurate in the circumstances and were not out of the normal course of business.","The plaintiff banked with the defendant and at the time of the accident the Compain's were indebted to the Royal Bank under Royal Bank Credit Line and Visa credit card account. The Royal Bank agreed to defer commencement of any action with respect to the defaulted Bank Loans until such time as the respondent received an accident injury settlement from SGI. In the alternative the plaintiff bank defended and counter-claimed against the defendant for breach of the bank's duty of good faith, duty of confidentiality and by amendment application made at trial, and allowed by this judgment, breach of contract. HELD: The plaintiff bank's claim against the defendants was dismissed in total. 1)The plaintiff had expressly waived any contractual rights which he impliedly had to confidentiality of his credit information. By the provisions of paragraph 8 of the Personal Credit Line Agreement he authorized the Royal bank to release to Equifax the information that it did. This part of the plaintiff's claim was dismissed. 2)The Royal Bank acted fairly and reasonably throughout consistent with its obligations to the plaintiff and its general banking practices including its report to Equafine as a credit reporting agency. 3)There was no evidence that the characterization of these loans as being 'a bad debt, collection account or unable to locate' was out of the normal course of business. It is fair and reasonable inference to be drawn from all of the facts and circumstances that persons using and relying upon the Equifax statements would be familiar with the various codes and classifications used to generate the credit report. Although there was some argument as to whether or not this or some other credit agreement formed the basis for the credit and loan presently sued upon, no other agreement was produced by either party to suggest that an agreement other than the one referred to and marked as Exhibit P3 existed."
2_2011skpc5.txt,"The accused was charged with impaired driving and driving over. 08. The sole issue to be determined was whether the accused was the person operating the vehicle at the time of the stop. The police testified that they had walked through the bar before closing time and then returned to the bar at closing time. The evidence was that the accused had been seen playing drinking games in the bar. The police observed the people they had seen in the bar get into a truck and back up. The police activated their emergency equipment and approached the vehicle. The accused was sitting in the driver's seat when the police approached the vehicle. The defence suggested that another individual had been driving the truck when it backed up but had gone inside the bar to purchase off sale before the police approached the truck. HELD: The accused was convicted of both counts and a judicial stay was entered on the impaired driving count. The Court found that the evidence of the accused was unreliable as a result of her alcohol consumption on the offence date. The evidence of the person that the defence suggested was the driver was inconsistent and caused the Court concern about its reliability. The Court found that at the time the individuals got into the truck, the accused was behind the wheel and that she was the one who backed the vehicle up and pulled it forward. The keys were in the vehicle and it was running when the police came to the driver's door. The accused's blood alcohol content at the time of driving as shown by the Certificate of Analysis was 150 milligrams of alcohol in 100 millilitres of blood.","The accused was charged with impaired driving and driving over.08. The defence had admitted all of the essential elements of each charge; the only issue was whether or not the accused was the driver of the vehicle. HELD: 1) Based on the events of December 5, 2009, at Carrot River, the accused is guilty of impaired driving. The police were advised that there were a number of individuals who had left the bar that night, so they decided to drop in while on routine patrol. They returned to the hotel at 2:00 a.m. and observed the accused and another individual playing 'drinking games'. The entire incident took mere seconds from the time the vehicle backed up and then pulled in behind the vehicle; at most the officers would have had to have observed the individual exit the vehicle, but they were both adamant that they had the vehicle in their sight at all times and at no time did the driver's door fully open. 2) The defence evidence lacks reliability. The accused was found not guilty of all the counts as a fact. The keys were in the ignition when the police arrived at the bar and had been in the vehicle for approximately 1:00 am. 3) The accused had been very evasive in cross-examination, tendency he did not exhibit in examination-in-chief. The difference between the demeanour he exhibited during his testimony and that of the defence witness caused considerable concern. The officer was very clear that he was not sure of collateral matters, matters that would have been of no import in their investigation, and was not inclined to start to fill in blanks of evidence. 4) The fact that the accused's vehicle was already running and that she was in the front seat with him at the time of the incident does not disqualify her from driving. An accident is not an accident and until it becomes more serious, there is no doubt that her ability to observe what occurred was severely hampered by her alcohol intake."
b_2006skqb218.txt,"The respondent applies to vary the consent joint custody order granted in October 2004. His application was prompted by the relocation of the petitioner with one of their two children, Tyson. The sole issue on this variation application is the determination of the primary residence of Tyson. HELD: 1) The petitioner wants to move Tyson 5.5 hours away from the respondent. This also requires a change in access arrangements. These are changes in circumstances that are material.  2) The petitioner has developed a strong bond with Tyson. The respondent has developed a close relationship with the parties' other child Kailey. After Kailey went to live with the respondent, neither parent did much to facilitate the access of either child. Before the petitioner and Tyson moved, although a short distance apart, neither Kailey nor Tyson saw his or her non-custodial parent and sibling on a regular basis. Even telephone access has been sporadic. Both parents have established homes that accommodate only one child. 3) The petitioner's move must be considered in light of the circumstances that existed before the petitioner's relocation. The parties had already adopted a split custody arrangement without formalizing access or adjusting child support. 4) Permitting the petitioner to relocate is in the best interests of Tyson. It is important that Tyson continue to live in the home of the parent whose constant presence he has become accustomed to. The petitioner has always been Tyson's primary caregiver. The petitioner is the psychological parent.","HELD: The application was dismissed. The court found that the only viable option was to permit the petitioner to relocate the child to the Archerwill district, where he would be separated from his psychological parent. The only issue was determining the primary residence of the child. That involves deciding what is in his best interests. The law relating to the mobility rights of divorced parents was clearly defined in Gordon v. Goertz. The move must be considered in light of the circumstances that existed prior to the relocation. There are negative consequences in changing the child's primary residence. He would be separation from his biological parent. Kailey, admittedly at 11 years old, is the sibling who would be positive consequence if the child were living in the same home as her. HELD: 1) The child shall continue to be in the home of his primary residence where he will be most readily exposed to and to the people closest to him. The existing access arrangements do not uproot the child from his community, friends, school, activities and certainty. 2) The existing circumstances do hinder the ability of the children to maintain a close relationship with each other and with both parents. 3) The petitioner has made an effort to ensure that the child has primary residence with his primary parent. There is no evidence of any violent behaviour or conduct by the petitioner toward any member of the petitioner's family. If the petitioner has determined that the respondent prefers the ArcherWill district, it will be better if both children were in one home and there was no suggestion that the petitioner should be removed from the respondent's home. The relocation may actually improve the access attitude of the parents.  4) The respondent has settled in well with the petitioner and the petitioner. The petitioner viewed the circumstances from the perspective of her father. She has foreclosed the option of returning to live in the Kindersley district. It would not necessarily serve the respondent best interests to order the petitioner be entitled to retain the child’s primary residence only by returning to the Kinderville district."
9_1996canlii8701.txt,"The appellant appealed his conviction of distributing infringing copies of three computer programs.

Dismissing the appeal, that by placing the copyrighted computer pro-grams on his computer bulletin board in a compressed format, for ease of transmission, and allowing access by modem to the programs, the appellant was distributing the programs to the prejudice of the owner's copyright.","A young offender appealed his convictions on charges of distributing infringing copies of computer software contrary to s. 42(1)(c) of the Copyright Act. The appellant had been the operator of a computer bulletin board, which allowed other computer users to connect to his computer system by modem and leave messages, collect and send e-mail, play computer games and generally upload or download shareware or non-copyrighted computer programs. The three counts related to three different computer programs namely, QEMM Version 7.00, WordPerfect Version 6.0 for DOS and Microsoft MS-DOS 6. It was not disputed that the three programs were protected by the Act. Representatives of the owners of the three copyrights testified that no consent was given to the appellant to reproduce, copy or distribute their programs. Although it is suggested that the programs were'scrambled' so that they could not be copied or downloaded by the callers, the evidence accepted by the trial judge was that they were 'packaged' or 'compressed' for efficient storage and 'ease of transmission'. The second and third points raised concern the findings of the judge regarding the knowledge of the appellant and his role as operator of the bulletin board. Dismissing the appeal, that the learned trial judge did not err in concluding that the Crown had proved its case beyond a reasonable doubt. In fact, the Crown did not prove that the appellant distributed the copyrighted material, that he had the requisite knowledge, or that the distribution was to an extent that it prejudicially affected the owners."

Transcript Services provided a letter to the court enclosing the transcript of evidence in the trial. This letter was not copied to either the appellant or the respondent.

Steps were not taken to ensure that no disclosure of information would occur for a month after the firm was put on notice. At issue was whether the screening measures taken ensured that no disclosure would occur and satisfied the evidentiary burden imposed on the law firm. HELD: The solicitor and the law firm were disqualified from acting for the petitioner in the action. Because two years had lapsed further examinations were appropriate and an order issued for the petitioner to attend a further examination. If the updated information is not necessary for trial the petitioner may request costs at that time. The application for an order with respect to without prejudice offers of settlement was dismissed as matters of evidence were to be determined by the trial judge.  1)Since the decision in Martin v. Gray the Law Society amended the code of conduct to provide for rules where a member transfers from one law firm to another. 2)The difficulty in this case was that no measures were taken prior to or at the time the solicitor joined the firm to ensure confidentiality. The time period before taking appropriate steps was completely inadequate.  3)The second question, whether there was a risk that the confidential information will be used to the prejudice of the client, Martin v. Gray stated that once the presumption arises and is not rebutted, the lawyer's disqualification is automatic and no assurances or undertakings not to use the information will avail. 4)The respondent was awarded the costs of the motion fixed at $300.","FIAT.

In an action for professional negligence against a solicitor for failing to obtain specific security requested in written instructions, the plaintiff renegotiated the deal and no longer insisted upon receiving the specific security. That the plaintiff was estopped from exercising any rights against the solicitor under the original instructions.","This was an action for professional negligence against the defendant, a barrister and solicitor practising in Middleton, Nova Scotia. For the plaintiff, that the defendant had breached his and the plaintiff's contractual obligations by failing to supply the Corporation with a valid milk assignment. The terms of the loan offered were semi-annual payments of 1237 litres per day. The plaintiff was to repay the loan on a monthly basis. At issue was whether the defendant was to reimburse the plaintiff or not. Denying the plaintiff any damages, that it was patently unfair for the defendant to lull the plaintiff into a sense of security by renegotiating the deal with the Langilles and then, several years later, hold the defendant responsible under the original deal. Quite apart from the question of estoppel there are other circumstances which militate against the plaintiff in this case. Between the time the mortgage deal was made in 1979 and the foreclosure action several things occurred. FCC renegotiated new security for the mortgage and gave up the original security. There is a serious question that some of the surrendered security was of substantially greater value than that taken up. These actions were taken without any regard to the legal rights of the plaintiff."
7_2014skqb116.txt,"Tax Law – Contract for Services – Payment of PST The plaintiff has the onus of proving it is not liable for the payment of PST on a balance of probabilities. Parties are entitled to structure their legal relationships as they see fit. The Court must determine whether the tax is payable based on the agreements as constructed between Husky and the third parties. There was no evidence that Saskatchewan Finance and the third party contractors entered into an agreement to alter the nature of the contracts so that Husky paid PST when it would not otherwise have been obligated to pay. The evidence established that Husky determined the way in which bids were submitted and the way Husky was invoiced. In each contract, Husky required that the bid include a price for service and price for materials. In each case, it was contemplated that PST was in addition to the price bid for the materials provided. The contracts between Husky and the third parties all contain provisions and terms that provide for the sale of materials to Husky. On the basis of the contracts, there was a sale of tangible property under the PST Act. Husky was the user or consumer of the cement. The third parties were providing materials and services to assist in the construction of the oil well. Husky has failed to establish that the contracts were supply and install contracts. Husky was the ultimate user and consumer of the tangible personal property. Husky is not entitled to rely on mistake of law. Husky has failed to establish on a balance of probabilities that it is entitled to a refund of the PST it paid on well cementing contracts between itself and third parties.

The plaintiff sought refund of the $393,289.69 it had already paid to the third party contractors. The parties agreed to a standardised refund rate, which the court found to be within the range of 5% to 6%. The court rejected the plaintiff’s claim and awarded the refund amount to the plaintiff. The third party contractor, Sanjel, denied the claims and raised three defences: 1) that they relied on the Saskatchewan Government representations and interpretations in collecting and remitting the PST; 2) that the true and full intention of the plaintiff and the defendant were not contained exclusively in the terms and conditions of the contracts; and 3) that other documents outside the contracts formed part of those contracts and set out additional terms and/or set out the intentions of the defendants and the plaintiff properly levied and collected tax."

HELD: 1)Section 258(7) has been judicially amended to mean 'true copy' which presumably, though not logically, means something more than 'copy'. It has grown to the point that an affidavit may be disregarded if the police do not provide supplemental evidence when challenged as to the manner in which they assured the accuracy of the copy. 2)The trial judge further advanced the law to a point where, even when not challenged, there is an obligation to provide supplemental evidence of comparison in order to buttress the evidence of the affidavit. This is an error of law. A challenge under s258(7) should be based upon a discovered difference as between the copy and the original.

The appellant has failed to persuade us that Mr. Justice Koch erred in any material respect. In other words, we see no tenable basis for interfering with his decision. [2] The debtor clearly committed an act of bankruptcy under ss. 42(1)(e) of the Bankruptcy and Insolvency Act, R.S.C. 1985, c. B-3, as a result of the sheriff's return of nulla bona to the respondent's writ of execution against the debtor. [3] That left Justice Koch to consider whether to dismiss the petition pursuant to ss. 43(7) of the Act or to stay proceedings on the petition pursuant to ss. 43(11). [4] As for the first, the debtor did not satisfy Justice Koch that he was able to pay his debts or that there existed other sufficient cause to dismiss the petition. Based on the evidence adduced by the debtor, we are of the view there is no basis to conclude that Mr. Justice Koch should have been satisfied of these matters. [5] As for second, concerning ss. 43(11), we note that the subsection contains discretionary power to stay proceedings. That, of course, serves to narrow the basis for intervention on appeal. We cannot say Justice Koch erred in any requisite respect in the exercise of this discretionary power. [6] Accordingly, the appeal is dismissed, with costs on appeal to the respondent to be taxed in the usual way.","Fulltext of judgment follows: [1] It will not be necessary for us to hear from the respondent. The appellant has failed to persuade us that Mr. Justice Koch erred in any material respect. In other words, we see no tenable basis for interfering with his decision. [2] The debtor clearly committed an act of bankruptcy under s.42(1)(e) of the Bankruptcy and Insolvency Act as result of the sheriff's return of nulla bona to the respondent's writ of execution against the debtor. That left Justice Koch to consider whether to dismiss the petition pursuant to s.43(7) or to stay proceedings on the petition under s43(11). In otherwords, we saw no tenability basis for interference with his Decision. [3] The appeal is dismissed, with costs on appeal to the respondents to be taxed in the usual way.

3_1999canlii12358.txt,"Two female employees filed complaints with the Saskatchewan Human Rights Commission alleging sexual harassment and discrimination contrary to the Saskatchewan Human Rights Code. The unionized employer applied for judicial review in the nature of prohibition contending the provisions of the Code were superseded by the collective agreement and s.25 of the Trade Union with the result that the Board of Inquiry lacked jurisdiction to hear the complaint. The chambers judge found the Act took precedence over the Code on the basis that the Act dealt specifically with the employment relationship and granted an order prohibiting the Board of Inquiry from hearing and determining the matter. Sub-questions to be determined included: what are the statutory schemes of the Trade Union Act and the Saskatchewan Human Rights Code; what has the Supreme of Canada decided about the exclusive jurisdiction of an arbitrator to resolve disputes in the context of labour law; the essential character of the dispute and ambit of the collective agreement; whether either the Code or the Act has exclusive jurisdiction to decide the dispute and if not, which statute takes priority or is paramount. HELD: The order of the Court of Queen's Bench was set aside and the matter was remitted to the Board of Inquiry appointed under the provisions of the Code. 1)The chambers judge correctly decided that the issue in this case is confined to a determination of the correct forum in which to bring the complaint of sexual harassment. 2)Human rights are fundamental, quasi-constitutional rights which embody fundamental values and public policy. Because human rights are not private rights, but public rights which constitute fundamental public policy, parties are not able to contract out of, alter, amend, or repeal or create exceptions to human rights provisions. To do otherwise would permit the denigration of the rights and obviate the protection of the rights the statute seeks to protect. 3)The mere fact that a collective agreement includes an article or clause which complies with the Code or a provision which covenants not to discriminate on the basis of the grounds set out in the Code, does not in and of itself transform the nature of the dispute from a human rights violation to a breach of the collective agreement. The ambit of the collective agreement does not affect the finding that the essential nature of the dispute is a human rights violation particularly when the public interest component and wide powers granted under the Code to redress a violation are taken into account. It is not in its essential character a complaint arising out of the employment relationship under the collective agreement.  4)The Commission was awarded its costs on double column V in this Court and on the appropriate Court of Queen's Bench tariff. No costs were requested by the intervenor.ADDENDUM: Paragraphs number 25 and 31 are substituted as follows: [25] This position was reinforced by Weber v. Ontario Hydro and New Brunswick v. O'Leary. The policy driving such decisions is that the dispute resolution process, established by the various labour statutes, should not be duplicated or undermined by concurrent common law actions in the courts. This also conforms to the theory of deference that courts accord decisions of specialized tribunals. For a complete discussion of the issue see Parr and Prince Albert District Health Board v. Saskatchewan Federation of Labour released concurrently with this judgment. The Ambit of the Collective Agreement [31] One must not lose sight of the fact that the terms of the collective agreement itself can play an important role in the determination of whether the jurisdiction of the court has been ousted in favour of an arbitrator. The fact that parties have included an anti-discrimination clause in the collective agreement does not alter the fundamental nature of the dispute or have the effect of extending the scope of the arbitrator's jurisdiction. It may play a role in determining whether the statutory tribunal would decide to hear the complaint, but it cannot affect the determination of the essential nature of the dispute or the question of jurisdiction. The essential issue is whether this complaint is a dispute between the parties with respect to the meaning, application or alleged violation of the collective agreement. To find that it is, with the result that the dispute must be arbitrated, would permit the parties to contract out of the Code, something they cannot do.","The plaintiff union applied for judicial review in the nature of a prohibition contending the provisions of the Code were superseded by the collective agreement and s25(1) of the Trade Union Act. The plaintiff union alleged that both the union and the employer discriminated against them on the basis of their sex. The parties agreed to comply with the terms of their collective agreement. The dispute was a dispute between the parties with respect to the meaning, application or violation of the collective agreements. The policy driving such decisions is that the dispute resolution process, established by the various labour statutes, should not be duplicated or undermined by concurrent common law actions in the courts. This also conforms to the theory of deference that courts accord to specialized tribunals. HELD: The issue in this case was whether s. 25 of the Act prevents the complainants from having their allegations of sexual harassment decided under the Code. The mere fact that the parties have included an anti-discrimination clause in the agreement does not alter the fundamental nature of the dispute or have the effect of extending the scope of the arbitrator's jurisdiction. The law is clear that disputes are not private rights but public rights which constitute fundamental public policy. Accordingly, parties are not able to contract out of the provisions. The fact that parties included anAnti-Discrimination clause does nothing to alter the essential character of this complaint. It is of no importance that sexual harassment could also be characterized as a violation of s. 16(1). This is a theory of respectability that has been advanced by the Supreme Court of Canada."
e_2005skqb51.txt,"The plaintiff seeks damages for unlawful arrest and assault, including aggravated or punitive damages arising out of events which resulted in his arrest and a charge of obstruction. During the course of his arrest, the plaintiff received cut to his scalp. He remained in custody until released at approximately 7:30 a.m. that morning. The three named defendants are members of the Saskatoon Police Service. The City of Saskatoon is their employer. HELD: The action for wrongful arrest is dismissed. The plaintiff was assaulted when his head was driven onto the hood of the vehicle. The plaintiff is awarded $2,500 in general damages and pre-judgment interest on that amount. It is not an appropriate case to award punitive damages, but the Court awarded solicitor client costs to the plaintiff in the amount of $6,000 plus taxable disbursements. 1) The Court accepted the plaintiff's evidence that he did not physically interfere with the police officers outside of the lounge. The police officers that attended at the lounge and became involved in the arrest of Mr. Sampson were in the execution of their duty. The plaintiff does not dispute that he possessed the general intent to make the comments that he did throughout the proceedings and that he did so wilfully. The issue is whether or not his actions obstructed the police officers, who were in the execution of their duty. 2) The combined actions of the plaintiff and Ms. Krupa clearly interfered with the police officers' arrest of Mr. Sampson, to the point that Constable Pura called for back-up help. Once the back-up officers arrived, one of them was required to expend time and effort restricting the movements of the plaintiff and Ms. Krupa. Once on the street, they again confronted the police officers. Their combined actions clearly affected the work of the police officers in the execution of their duty. There were reasonable and probable grounds to believe the plaintiff was obstructing the police officers in the course of their duty. 3) On the facts in this matter, the same conclusion is arrived at based solely on the plaintiff's individual actions. The plaintiff's officious interference consisted of verbal abuse, excessive criticism and undue pertinacity in his discussion and questioning and provided reasonable and probable grounds to believe he was obstructing police officers in the execution of their duty. The action for wrongful arrest is dismissed. 4) The cut to the plaintiff's head is a minor one, not requiring stitches or immediate medical attention. The plaintiff experienced headaches for several weeks. He also had stiff neck and sleep disturbance. There were no long term effects. Corrigendum received January 25, 2005 and added to fulltext.","HELD: The plaintiff was awarded damages for unlawful arrest and assault, including aggravated or punitive damages, arising out of events which resulted in his arrest and a charge of obstruction. The events surrounding the arrest involved the police officers arresting and removing a patron of a local lounge for being intoxicated in a public place. The actions of the defendant outside of the lounge were in dispute. The issues were credibility, whether the defendant's actions amounted to obstruction, whether any of the reasonable force provisions of the Criminal Code applied, and whether the plaintiff was assaulted."
c_2004nssc248.txt,"In a divorce proceeding, the wife claimed lump sum spousal support in the amount of $20,000 to allow her to return to her native country. She also claimed that periodic maintenance was not appropriate because of the difficulty of enforcement when she is living abroad and referenced two occasions when the husband was paying periodic support that she had to seek the assistance of Maintenance Enforcement. The husband opposed paying any more spousal support but expressed a preference for lump sum support if he was required to pay more, as it would allow him to move on with his life with his new family. Husband ordered to pay a lump sum award of $10,000 to wife; when the parties moved to Nova Scotia, the husband was able to improve his financial situation, while the wife's position deteriorated.","The parties were married in 1996 and had previously been married in Sweden. There were no children of the relationship and the only issue on this hearing was the respondent's claim for lump sum spousal support. The parties agreed all property had been divided to their mutual satisfaction and an outstanding debt of approximately 34,000 krona was their joint responsibility. The respondent had recently moved to Nova Scotia from Sweden and the court was satisfied that, even with the lump sum payment, there still remained a need for further support.HELD: The respondent was to pay by lump sum $10,000. The court ordered that lump sum payments be made in such a fashion as to meet the respondent’s needs and to provide a level of support that would enable her to achieve her goal of self-sufficiency. It was not necessary for the respondent to establish there had been a change in circumstances."

Quashing three of the 11 committals, that the judge failed to follow the literal formality of s. 541(1) of the Criminal Code. After specifically excluding the three from the reading of s. 541(1), the judge simply reminded them they had heard the reading on the previous day. The jurisdiction of the preliminary inquiry judge was also discussed.","All the accused were charged with trafficking cocaine contrary to s.491 of the Criminal Code, and the Provincial Court Judge committed all the accused to stand trial. At issue was whether the Preliminary Inquiry had the jurisdiction to carry on the trial of the accused, and whether the writ of certiorari applied to quash the committal of the four accused on the conspiracy charge. HELD: The application was allowed in part and the trial was to continue until the date of trial. 1)The judge's assessment of the evidence in relation to the accused was that of absconding did not have the real effect of the test which it did in this case, but the judge did have the discretion to exclude the accused's counsel from the proceeding. 2)There was no breach of the mandatory provision of the Code. The words 'your opportunity to speak out and and so on' are to the 'like effect' of the words of s.515(1)(c). 3)The Court was satisfied that the Provincial Judge had failed to meet the onus of ascertaining whether the accused had absconded and therefore should be committal. 4)The committal for trial was quashed. 5)The trial judge failed to consider whether the words 'absconding' or simply absence' were to the effect of s541. The Court was also satisfied that statements made by the judge were not to inhibit or intimidate counsel."
e_1998canlii13440.txt,"The applicants sought an order under s.11 of the Landlord and Tenant Act vesting the whole term of their sub-lease with either VIP Business Centre (VIP) or 598710 Saskatchewan Ltd (SaskLtd). Bennett, owner of an office building (the Plaza), leased space to VIP for five years ending in 1997. Issues included (i)whether there had been a valid renewal of the head lease; (ii)whether there had been valid renewals of sub-leases; (iii)assuming valid renewals, did s4 of the Statute of Frauds bar enforcement against Bennett; (iv)whether the Court had jurisdiction to hear an application for relief under s11 brought solely by notice of motion; (v)are the applicants entitled to such relief; (vi)whether Bennett was bound by the sub-leases by virtue of taking the assignment from VIP. HELD: The application was dismissed. 1)It was assumed that the evidence led by the applicants was true in order to determine issues (iii) and (iv) which dispose of the application. Issues (i), (ii) and (vi) could not be dealt with summarily because of the conflicting affidavits. 2)Notwithstanding Queen's Bench Rule 13(1), the term action in s11 includes summary application by way of notice of motion. There is no reason for landlords to have better access to this Court than the tenants concerning possession of demised premises. The words 'or otherwise' include extrajudicial actions by landlords, including re-entry. Had it been concluded that it was necessry to proceed by statement of claim, such error would have been procedural one, curable under Rule without affecting the jurisdiction of the Court. 3)The Court should exercise its discretion within the guidelines outlined in Golden Griddle. grant of relief requested by the applicant would constitute an improper exercise of such discretion. They were not the sole tenant in stand alone building of the kind in Chatham Empire Theatre. The relief sought would unfairly affect the landlord. As the applicants expressed no interest in taking over the whole head lease premises on the terms of the head lease, there was no need for a conditional order of the nature of London Bridge. 4)The only memoranda consisted of the original head lease and subleases and the unsigned fax messages. The fax messages did not meet the essential requirements for a valid lease. The actions and performance by VIP and the applicant fell short of constituting part performance for the purposes of s.4 regardless of a narrow or broad interpretation of the doctrine. In any case the Court would not have exercised its discretion by binding Bennett with leases which comprised less than 15% of the head premises in the absence of evidence that clearly demonstrated the owner's ability to rent out the balance of the head lease premises was not impaired economically or physically. The applciants could obtain other office space including that offered by Bennett. General and punitive damages would provide an adequate remedy.","The applicants sought an order under s.11 of The Landlord and Tenant Act vesting the whole term of their sub-leases with either V.I.P. Business Centre or 598710 Saskatchewan Ltd. on such conditions as the Court deems proper. The latter had deposed the applicants and asked them to relocate to a separate building totally occupied by the applicants. The applicants did not proceed by statement of claim. HELD: 1)The applicants fell short of constituting part of the performance for the purposes of s.4, regardless of whether anarrow or broad interpretation of the doctrine is applied. 2)If the alleged sub-lease renewals are valid, the Court lacks jurisdiction to grant the relief where sought solely by notice of motion. In the alternative, the applicants are bound by their subleases as consequence of taking an assignment of VIP's leases.  3)The only memoranda consist of the original head lease, the original subleases between VIP and the applicants, and the defendant's fax messages. The defendant never signed these documents. 4)The defendant and the applicant had entered into an agreement whereby the head lease was to be renewed for a term of 5 years. The terms of the agreement were not disclosed to the applicants but a material fact was withheld by the defendants. 5)The applicant's application for possession was dismissed. The court found that the actions and performance of the applicant and the landlords fell short in terms of part of performance for s. 4, even if anarrow interpretation of that doctrine was applied. The application for relief against the landlord was dismissed because the defendant failed to provide the necessary supporting evidence for its claim. 6)Reference cannot be made to renewal of the head or sub lease because one was never reduced to writing. In fact, the parties failed to agree on its terms. 7)Although the Court has considerable discretion under s11 of the Act, in its discretion it should exercise such discretion within the guidelines outlined in Re Golden Griddle. grant of the relief requested by the applicant would constitute an improper exercise of that discretion. 8)The actions and performances of the applicants fall below the requirements of partperformance for the purpose of s4, irrespective of whether such anarrow, broad interpretation is applied to the doctrine. 9)Under s11 the applicants have not obeyed requirements by way of part performance of their contractual obligations with the defendant. The Court found that in the alternative the defendant is bound thereby by virtue of taking the assignment from the plaintiff. 10)While the Court had considerable discretion"
5_2009nspc10.txt,"The accused was arrested for possession of drugs and a weapon, and for breaching his probation. Police testified they saw him walking down the street at 10am and noticed a strong smell of marijuana. When approached, he was smoking a cigarette in front of the provincial courthouse. He said he had smoked marijuana on the street, but did not have any other drugs on him. After they spoke, he asked to leave, saying he was late for a court appointment. The police asked him to deal with this matter first, ran a CPIC check and discovered the accused was on probation and required to keep the peace and be of good behaviour. He was not cautioned/advised of his right to counsel until he was arrested on the basis of what the Crown claimed was a reasonable belief the accused possessed drugs. Police conducted a 'pat-down' search, and found drugs (marijuana and cocaine) and a weapon. The accused argued his Charter rights were violated (s. 8, 9 and 10(b)) and asked the court to exclude the evidence obtained in the search. He also argued his admission/statement was not voluntary and should be excluded on the basis that it was given in the context of a violation of his Charter rights. Motions to exclude the statement and evidence obtained in the search denied. The accused's s. 8 and 9 rights were not breached. While his s. 10(b) rights were violated when he asked to leave and the officers asked him to deal with this first (which amounted to detention), his admission/statement was made before the detention and was voluntary. Further, no evidence was obtained as a result of the breach since the search only took place after the arrest/cautioning. After reviewing the relevant jurisprudence, the court concluded: the Crown must prove the arresting officer subjectively believed they found an offence apparently being committed; that subjective belief must be objectively reasonable; police may rely on an inference in forming their belief (such as the inference that marijuana smokers typically carry a supply with them); and that inference must be objectively reasonable in light of the circumstances and facts of the case. Here, the officer's subjective belief that the accused was in possession of drugs was objectively reasonable. The court accepted her evidence that she had special training in identifying the smell of marijuana and distinguishing between a strong and faint smell of marijuana. The CPIC check showed he was on probation in relation to a drug charge. Since the officer had the authority to arrest under s. 495(1)(b) of the Criminal Code, the arrest was lawful. The search taking place incidental to the arrest was reasonable. In obiter, the court went on to say that, even if the accused's s. 8 and 9 Charter rights had been breached, an analysis under s. 24 would lead to a decision not to exclude the evidence: it was not conscriptive; the offence was serious; there was no bad faith on the part of police; and the accused could have lawfully been arrested for admitting to what was a breach of his probation.","The accused was charged with possession of cannabis marijuana and possession of cocaine for the purpose of trafficking. The search of his person was conducted on the sidewalk outside of the courthouse. During the search, the officers noted a strong smell of marijuana coming from the accused's person. The accused indicated to the officers that he had just smoked a cigarette. The officers approached the accused and noted a smell of burned marijuana. The officer did not detect the smell of cigarettes but the officer did detect it from the inside of the accused. The evidence showed that the accused had recently consumed a marijuana cigarette and appeared to be in good spirits. The police had no reason to arrest the accused prior to their arrest because they believed that he was under the influence of marijuana. They arrested the accused for possession of marijuana and searched his vehicle. During their search, they found one gram of marijuana, which they believed to be cannabis. The arrest was found to be unlawful and the cannabis marijuana was excluded from the evidence. The defence argued that the officer's stated reason for arrest was based upon reasonable and probable grounds rather than on an inference that more, un-smoked marijuana was present. They also contested the voluntariness of a statement given by the accused to the police. The Court of Appeal concluded that the argument regarding the legality of the arresting officer's action was in terms of reasonable grounds and there was no breach of that principle. In this case, the accused was found not guilty. The facts were not in dispute. There were no breaches of s. 8 and s. 9 of the Charter. There was a clear violation of the defence's s. 10(b) rights by the police in that the search of the vehicle was conducted before the officer had a reasonable chance of leaving the premises."
9_1994canlii4283.txt,"The respondent had undertaken the residential development of certain lands bordering the appellant's property and constructed roadways which it proposed to convey to the Department of Transportation, who agreed to accept with the consent of owners of property where water would drain from the road. When the appellant refused to consent, the respondent applied to the municipality for proceedings under the Ditches and Water Courses Act, which failed to achieve agreement. The respondent then filed a requisition with the county clerk pursuant to s. 7(1) of the Act which allows for the appointment of a municipal engineer. The engineer filed a report in which he concluded the respondent was entitled to open a ditch on the appellant's land, subject to certain conditions. In this action, the appellant appealed pursuant to s. 12 of the Act. Allowing the appeal, that the Act appears to assume that landowners will agree that a ditch benefits their land and provides a mechanism for apportioning cost. However, it does not give an engineer authority to expropriate land or take any interest in it, nor does it provide a means by which the appellant is forced to accept the ditch. Further, the common law prohibits the use of another's property to solve one's drainage problems.","The applicant developer, Armoyan, made an application to the municipality of Halifax for implementation of proceedings under the Ditches and Water Courses Act. Meetings failed to achieve agreement. Armoyano, as a subdividing developer, filed a requisition with the clerk of the county pursuant to s.7(1) of the Act. HELD: The applicant's application was dismissed. The scope of appeal was set forth in s.12. The applicant was entitled to have its costs paid by Armoyans.  1)The applicant failed to meet the specific requirements set out in the Act by failing to comply with them.  2)The Act provides a method of apportioning the cost of the ditch or drain amongst the owners and prescribing the means by which will be determined the necessary technical details of the drainage. The proper outlet is for the water to flow through the land. 3)The respondent was not entitled to refuse to pay the engineer's fees.  4)The court found that Armoynan, as sub-divident, was entitled, pursuant to ss.9 and s.10, to have the drainage rights of the adjacent property owners extinguished."
b_2001skca85.txt,"The Court of Appeal was required to determine the limits of its authority to change the application of the Rule against Perpetuities, an established common law principle, to a particular type of oil and gas lease. In 1950 Taylor entered a 'top' (head) lease for mineral rights with Freeholders Oil, effective upon the expiry of Imperial's interest in 1959. The new owner of the land recognized the assignment of the 1961 top lease sold to Tarragon in 1993. After reaching an agreement in 1993 in principle for a 'farmout' arrangement whereby Maxx agreed to drill the lands for Tarragon, Maxx concluded the top lease offended the Rule against Perpetuities and entered its own lease with the landowner. The trial judge held the 1950 Freeholders lease was void because it contravened the Rule against Perpetuities; although top leases do not offend the policy behind the rule, any modification of the rule is best left to the legislature; there was a breach of confidence. HELD: The appeal was allowed with costs on double column V. The action for a declaration that the top lease is void was dismissed with costs in Queen's Bench. 1)The top lease in question was not void as it did not offend the object and purpose of the Rule. The reasoning and approach of the Supreme Court of Canada in Salituro, Tolofson and Morguard was persuasive. The decision of the House of Lords in Arthur J S Hall demonstrates the need to re-examine archaic rules of common law which cannot be justified in modern society. The genius of the common law lies in its adaptiveness to changing times. Its basic principles are not meant to become rigid formulae. Common law rules may be tweaked to do justice between the parties when a rigid and mechanistic application of the rule would run counter to the object and purpose of the rule. Since the socio-economic and political conditions which gave rise to the creation of the Rule no longer exist, it was open to the Court to consider the application of the rule in the context of a commercial instrument such as the top lease in question.  2)Although top leases have been attacked on other grounds, this was the first case before the Saskatchewan Courts in which the Rule against Perpetuities has been advanced to void such a lease. The historical background and object and purpose of the rule were reviewed. The general purpose is to prevent the tying up of property to the detriment of society in general. The common law rule against perpetuities prevails over intention because it is not a rule of construction, but a rule of property. A mere possibility, or even a probability that the estate or interest may vest within the time is not enough. The 'wait and see' doctrine has been adopted by statute in some jurisdictions.DISSENT: The Court should not modify the Rule in the face of the significance of such a modification, the efforts of the legislature to legislate and the inability to deal with such issues as the retrospective operation of such a decision. The Rule against Perpetuities applies to this top lease. As there is no life in being in this case, the interest must vest within 21 years of its creation which would have been 1971. The Rule is not concerned with the duration of an interest but only that an interest may vest at a remote time in the future. The rule invalidates interests in land that vest too remotely.",The trial judge held that the lease was void because it breached the rule against perpetuities and allowed the respondents' action for declaration to that effect. He allowed the counterclaim by the appellant against the respondent for breach of confidence with consequent directions for an accounting and assessment of damages. The principal question on this appeal is whether the appellants' oil and gas 'top lease' with the late Harry Herbert Taylor should be rendered void by rule 14.5 of the rule. HELD: 1) The trial judge found that the 1989 Freeholders agreement was void by reason of the common law rule of perpetuity. He found that it was possible for the parties to have a contingent relationship with future vesting as to the reversionary interest in the mines and minerals. It was only after the time of vesting had been ascertained that a determination could be made about whether that time was too remote and therefore in contravention of the rules. 2) The parties chose to negotiate a farmout agreement with Tarragon. This was tantamount to a joint venture and the parties reached an agreement in principle. The only matter to be resolved was for the Travagon to satisfy itself that Tarracon had good title. 3) The defendants were allowed to use a copy of the original 1950 Freeholders lease which they had been unable to obtain on their own. 4) The plaintiff was awarded three Hundred and Twenty (320) shares with nominal or par value of One Dollar per share in the capital stock of the GRANTEE. The proceeds were divided equally among the three classes of shares. 5) The court declined to order the plaintiff to pay any costs to the respondent.

HELD: A trial of the issue was directed, as it could not be decided on the material filed whether he was intentionally unemployed or underemployed. The father's circumstances had changed since the consent order. The fact he no longer resided with a girlfriend and was making payments on a truck did not justify any reduction. Income should not be imputed based on former employment that is no longer available or practicable.","FIAT. The respondent father applied to vary a consent order dated April 5, 2001 by reducing his required child support payments from $236 per month to $19.00 per month. The consent order was granted one month after the respondent had quit his employment at Lilydale Foods in Wynyard. Although he remained unemployed, the respondent agreed to pay child support based upon an imputed annual income of $17,386. He purchased a one-half ton truck which he had been making payments of $624 per month and no longer residing with his girlfriend. The 'changed circumstances' did not justify any reduction in his child support obligations. HELD: 1)The real issue is whether the respondent is intentionally underemployed or unemployed within the meaning of s. 19(1)(a) of the Federal Child Support Guidelines. The issue on the basis of the material filed was whether he was earning an income that was no longer available or practicable. 2)The respondent says that he quit his job at Lilytraffox, which involved shift work and weekends, so that he could exercise access to his children. Given that he agreed to paying child support on imputed income from his former employment, either he expected to earn comparable income elsewhere (failing which he could return to Lilydale) or he quit to avoid his childsupport obligation.  3)The Court could not decide on the issue of whether it was intentionally undetermined or unemployed as there was no information available as to his current employment status. It would be on the respondent to establish that his current employer is commensurate with his ability, experience, training and the market place in which he resides."
c_2012nsca78.txt,", motion denied. While the province has an arguable appeal, it does not concern a summary judgment motion that would result in the claims being dismissed outright. If the certification order is struck, the province will still face individual claims. The AG has not shown that defending individual actions will cost less than defending one class proceeding. There is no evidence to estimate how it may incur significantly higher expenses as a result of how the points at issue in the appeal are resolved. The matter has been ongoing for some time and it is reasonable to expect the province has already spent time and money to prepare the defence they will eventually file. To succeed on this basis, the court would require a reliable indication of what remains to be done during the stay period, what component of that residue would be wasted if the appeal is allowed, and some estimate of that cost.","The plaintiffs sought a stay pending their appeal of a certification order in a class action. The defendants had initially moved for a stay, arguing that a certification hearing would be a preferable procedure for the representative plaintiffs to advance their litigation. They later amended the motion to strike the certification order and sought damages for their own exposure and for injury to their property and their value. In the intervening years, the litigation had evolved into a more complex and protracted class action, with some claims being settled or abandoned, others being struck or moved to a class proceeding. The plaintiffs sought to have the certification hearing held after the Court of Appeal's decision on the class certification application. The judge found that the litigation would continue, albeit in a different venue, and there was a high bar for arguability. Stay granted; the motion for stay is dismissed. There is no evidence that the stay will cause irreparable harm or that the costs of defending individual claims will be significantly higher. The court will not analyse the fine points of the Province's submissions or the respondents' reply. Civil Procedure Rule 1.01 says that at some time before a class certification hearing, the parties and the court approached the December 2010 hearing as addressing an amendment to the original Motion, not a replacement for the motion which had been presented at the earlier sessions. The parties would be discovered whether there is a common issues trial, under certification, or individual claims by those parties.

The respondent contended that it should be on a full-time basis, and applied to the Supreme Court in chambers for an order quashing the appellant's decision. The chambers judge found that the appellant had ignored the clear words of s.37 of the Workers' Compensation Act in reaching its decision, and thus had exceeded its jurisdiction; the decision was quashed and the matter remitted back to the Board. The appellant appealed. Allowing the appeal and setting aside the order to quash, that s.37 of the Act was not a section limiting the Board's jurisdiction and that, considering s.37 and s.53 of the Act, the decision of the Board was not patently erroneous.","This was an appeal from a decision allowing an application for certiorari to quash a decision of the Workers' Compensation Board and remitting the matter to the Board to determine the rate of compensation payable to the respondent. Dismissing the appeal, that s. 37 of the Act limited the Board's jurisdiction; in fact, it exceeded its jurisdiction by amounting to $10,000 per year. The Board had regard to the facts as found by the tribunal, the purpose of which was the tribunal being set up, the purposes of which were the same: to determine whether a worker was employed on a full-time basis as of the date of the accident, and to do so on a semi-regular basis."
b_1999canlii12407.txt,"The defendant, who was to install sewer and water lines on four lots for the hamlet, was charged with seven violations of the Occupational Health and Safety Act and Regulations. It had been agreed that the offences were strict liability. The principle issue was whether the defendant had an obligation imposed by law with respect to the workers and if so whether he discharged it by exercising due diligence in the circumstances. The essential facts were not in dispute. HELD: The defendant was found guilty on all offences.  1)There is a legal duty on an employer under the Act to take steps to supervise and oversee excavations to ensure the usual protocols for safety are met. This requires at a minimum the presence of an experienced person on site. Any reasonable person with some knowledge of worksite safety would insist that the walls be properly sloped, that there be at a ladder or other method to get out of the trench and that first aid supplies were readily available. Supervision is essential particularly when the worker is inexperienced. The deceased had had no experience in sewer and water trenching. No inexperienced person should be allowed to work on such a potentially dangerous site without proper training and specific guidance and supervision. The Law is specific on the requirements to be met for safety of the workers on excavation and sewer and water hookups. 2)The remedial progress report was ruled inadmissible. There was no formal comment on the issue of admissibility. 3)The Act does not define due diligence but well established case authority defines it as taking reasonable care to avoid causing harm which is prohibited by law. 4)The Act does not apply to a contractor. The relationship had all the ordinary indicia of an employer/employee relationship. The defendant controlled the project, tools and materials and bore the risk of loss or profit, had the ultimate responsibility for the worksite, completion of the project and the payment of wages.","The defendant was charged with seven violations of The Occupational Health and Safety Act, 1993 being Chapter 0-1.1 of the Statutes of Saskatchewan and Regulations made pursuant to the Act. The defendant had placed a contract with the Hamlet to install sewer and water lines on four lots. The contract was obtained by using the services of an individual he knew who was hired to do the trenching and pipe-laying in the defendant's service. The individuals were to provide backhoe, piping and gasoline to the defendant, along with the defendant and his nephew, Kenneth Shatilla. The defendants used the nephew of the defendant to lay pipe for the defendant. The nephew had no experience in trenching but had completed the job well in advance of the date the contract was executed. The relationship between the defendants was one of master and servant or employer to workers and the defendant had no expectation of receiving anything but wages for hours worked at the Hill; they certainly had no prospect of making profit on the job wages not profits were in the contemplation of all involved. The backhoe was rented by the defendant but was not available to the defendants; the defendant left his inexperienced nephew alone in the trench and went to look for a piece of pipe located near trailer on the surface. He was gone for about 2.5 hours before the defendant arrived at the work site. He left his nephew alone on the worksite because he was extremely busy with other business. He died because he did not take any reasonable precautions to prevent death or injury to the workers whom he was responsible for. The report was simply marked for identification pending the court's ruling. HELD: The defendant was found guilty of seven counts of occupational health and safety related offences.  1)Once one finds that there was a legal duty on the defendant as an employer under the Act, his obligations under the law are to take active steps to supervise and oversee the excavations to make sure the usual protocols for job safety are met. He did not do this because he chose not to do so.  2)Once the defendant has an obligation under the act to provide and maintain for the workers at the St. George's Hill excavation site, he had a duty to exercise due diligence in the circumstances.  3)Once it finds that a legal obligation does not have an obligation it is exercised by exercising due diligence. It is unnecessary to leave it to another court on another day when the issue may be central to the outcome of case"
c_2008nssm39.txt,"The applicant law firm applied for a taxation of accounts in a complicated family law matter. The client contended that there was obvious overbilling and that the solicitor was negligent in failing to specify in an interim Order the actual time at which she had to leave the matrimonial home. Accounts as presented are certified; there was no indication whatsoever of overbilling, whether with respect to legal fees or disbursements, and there was no negligence on the part of the solicitor as she had acted reasonably in relying on the representations of the husband's lawyer as to when the Order would be enforced. It is not always necessary to examine every single entry in detail on a line-by-line basis; an overall view of the entries contained in an account can be taken when assessing reasonableness. The temporal limitation of cross-examination is within the Small Claims Court's scope of discretion in special circumstances.","The applicant sought a taxation of the accounts that the respondent had issued to the applicant. The respondent argued that the applicant's estranged husband had either been convicted of or plead guilty to a criminal charge and he did not pay a significant fine associated with the crime, and that she had been negligent in the execution of an order that granted interim exclusive possession of the matrimonial home and the interim custody of the child of the marriage to her estranged spouse. The applicant argued that to limit cross-examination in such a manner would constitute breach of natural justice. She also questioned the credibility of the respondent's legal accounts in light of the fact that she herself had been locked out of her home for three months prior to the commencement of the taxation hearing, and alleged that the appellant had asked more junior lawyers and other members of the applicant law firm to assist her in the matter in appropriate circumstances (and as expressly required, they were given a full allotment of time). The applicant made a motion requesting that she be excused because she was ""overbilled"". The respondent made a similar motion at the outset of the taxing hearing, which was also attended by the applicant and, in the process, caused her to abandon a significant amount of property in the courtroom and, as a result, she was ordered to pay $1,000 to a law firm specializing in the defence of her client. The appellant appealed. Dismissing the application, that there was a reasonable apprehension of bias on the part of the appellant, who was clearly articulate and capable of representing herself, and who was able to take the position that she would need exactly double that amount of time (i.e. three hours) to complete her questioning. The trial judge did not err in refusing to permit the appellant to cross-examine her, but rather allowed her to brief the appellant on her legal issues during the taxation proceeding and, after the hearing, allowed the application to proceed, and allowed the respondent to cross‑examine the applicant for the first time. The appellate judge found that the trial judge's evidence regarding her Crownside appearance should be preferred over the appellant's evidence concerning her retainer."

The appellant's solicitor at the time of the trial had called no expert evidence concerning either the proper construction of the chimney, which was alleged to be faultily constructed, or the cause of the fire. HELD: The appeal was dismissed with costs on double Column V, including costs of the motion to adduce fresh evidence. 1)The evidence was clearly available, clearly contemplated by the parties and for whatever reason not called. 2)The trial judge neither misapprehended nor failed to take into account evidence which was before him in arriving at his conclusion concerning the causation of the fire. There was evidence to permit the trial judge to make the findings of fact that he did and to award the damages based on those findings.","The appellants applied to adduce fresh evidence and to amend the statement of claim in the within action. The tests for the admission of fresh evidence were set out in R. v. Palmer, 1979 CanLII (SCC), [1980] S.C.R. 672) and in Lensen v. Lensen (1987) SCC, [1987] SCC), & Osiowy (1989) 1 SCC.R 672. The appellant contended that in the circumstances of this case the interests of justice require that the rule of due diligence should not be strictly applied.

Peller, [1980], [1980][SCC], [1988] SSC.R 670 and [1988][SK CA], 80 Sask. R. 14 (Sask C.A.).

C.R., 672 in the motion to adduct fresh evidence. HOLD: 1)The test for admission of new evidence on appeal were well established and are set out as in Linsen v. Jensen, 1987 CanLii (Scc), [1987], [88] SCLR.672. We are not persuaded in the circumstance that the trial judge either misapprehended or failed to take into account evidence which was before him in arriving at his conclusion concerning the causation of the fire. There was evidence which could have been adduced at the trial. 2)""In the circumstances the interests require that due diligence must not be strict"".

1996canlii6900.txt,"A decree nisi and an order granting custody to the mother was made in 1995. Upon appeal the Court of Appeal directed a new trial. Changes in circumstances included the fact that the child was developmentally delayed and required a special program. A pediatrician testified that inconsistency in parenting approaches would further delay the child's development. HELD: Custody was awarded to the father. 1)Each parent was a capable caregiver. However, the father was available to provide full-time care due to an employment disability and exhibited a strong desire to do so. The past physical abuse of his former spouse was not considered relevant as it did not affect his ability to parent the child. 2)The mother was to have weekly access on two non-consecutive days for eight hours and two hours on a third day. The child was to sleep in the same bed every night.","Saskatchewan: Two parents sought the custody of their child on the basis that he or she was best able to meet her needs. The central issue was what custody arrangement would be in Sophie's best interest. Each parent presented volumes of evidence respecting the shortcomings of the other, all with the view of discrediting the other's ability to act as the custodial parent. HELD: 1)To review all of such evidence presented during the five-day trial would be unproductive and lead to prolix judgment. 2)The issues before the court were in relation to the child's best interests. The issues before each parent were the same: what parenting regime was in best interest for the child and how long it would last. 3)The child had the best interests of both parents because she was born in the fall of 1993 and lived with each parent for three years. There was no convincing evidence to suggest that the past physical abuse of Tracy by Lorne diminished his ability to parent the child. The child had a very good relationship with her parents. 4)The father was unable to provide the degree of care and direction required of a child such that consistency and stability would be appropriate. 5)The parties agreed that the child would start the Buckwold Center program with the full support of her parents in fall 1996.  6)The principles outlined in McKee v. McKee were applied. The fact that Lorne avoided other acts of abuse in the last 3 years has led the Court to be less concerned with his past conduct. Although he was baited by Tracy's stepfather to react violently on several occasions and subjected to tense and emotionally trying situations concerning Sophie's care, he has avoided physical aggression."
2006skqb189.txt,"FIAT: The issues on this application are with respect to extraordinary expenses and the quantum of spousal support. HELD: 1) The petitioner's income is $73,000 versus $29,000 for the respondent. The parties cannot agree if any of the expenses fall into s. 7 of the Guidelines as being extraordinary: $975 for child care, $500 for dance, $350 for school activities, and $1,140 for asthma medication. 2) The court does not believe that the 'reasonable coverage' definition contained in the May 1, 2006 amendment is new law. At best, it is a single test now enunciated in legislative form which should provide for more consistency and predictability as opposed to the many attempts to articulate a definition of extraordinary which is found in the case law. What items claimed are necessary to attain the child's best interests and yet are reasonable given the economic circumstances of the child and her parents? Which items might be reasonably covered by the sum of the parent's income plus child support? 2) The child care costs and asthma medication costs are of sufficient amount and peculiar to this child as to be extraordinary or not expected to be reasonably covered from the table amount of child support and the respondent's income.  3) With respect to spousal support, neither counsel referred to the spousal support guidelines and the formula for spouses with children which measures the difference between the individual net disposable incomes of each former spouse. These guidelines suggest that an award of between 40% to 46% of that difference in individual net disposable income be paid by the spouse with the higher INDI to the former spouse with the lower INDI. These guidelines create a rough ballpark of $900 to $1,100 per month in this particular case. However, the petitioner is bearing the full responsibility for family debt repayment in the interim. In order to pay creditors in a timely fashion, the petitioner has taken this responsibility onto his shoulders. In the circumstances, it is ordered that the petitioner pay to the respondent interim spousal support of $700. The consequent reduction of family debt is therefore a factor of this particular interim spousal support order and should not cause confusion when addressing any property issue in the future.","FIAT: The respondent moves for an order granting to her, (1) joint custody and primary care of the child with access to her former spouse with respect to her current spouse; (2) interim spousal support in the sum of $750 per month retroactive to January 1, 2006; and (3) interim child support, with the respondent being designated as the primary caregiver and the respondent's residence being the primary residence of the petitioner. This is so ordered. The parties agreed that the established status quo of shared parenting shall also be included in this order. The petitioner is to pay 71% of the childcare costs, asthma medication costs are of sufficient amount and peculiar to the child as to be not expected to be reasonably covered from the table amount of child support and the father's income; the petitioner cares for the child after school, thereby reducing the need and cost of additional childcare, logical reason to place the entire cost of daycare as an expense to be borne by the respondent and not an offset. HELD: 1) The evidence upon the issue of retroactivity is minimal and the positions are conflicting. Child support, for interim purposes, shall commence in April 2006 in the amount of $625 per month and be paid 71% as special or extraordinary expenses as hereafter described.  2) The Court was satisfied that the parties agreed on the essential expenses and the corresponding ability to pay which were predominant considerations at the interim stage, yet not to the exclusion of the statutory factors and objectives recited by the Divorce Act and Family Maintenance Act. 3) The petitioner was to pay $750 as support for the infant born October 15, 1996 to the respondent. The respondent's input reduces the costof daycare to both the petitioner and her. In the likely event that the petitioner's health plan covers the residual cost of Keandra's asthma medication not paid for by the husband's plan, his s. payment is hereby decreased by $67.45 per month."
9_2001canlii390.txt,"The accused was charged with operating a motor vehicle while his ability to do so was impaired and while over .08 (breath sample readings were 160 and 150 mg) contrary to s. 253(a) and s.253(b) of the Criminal Code, respectively. Issues arising during the trial included whether there was a breach of his s.8 and s.9 Charter rights to be secure against unreasonable search or seizure, and not to be arbitrarily detained; if there was a breach, was there a remedy under s.24(2); whether the evidence was sufficient to prove the offence of impaired driving beyond a reasonable doubt. The police officer concluded that he had reasonable and probable grounds for the breath demand based upon the accused sleeping through two green traffic lights, a strong smell of alcohol, and his somewhat bloodshot or glassy eyes. HELD: The accused was acquitted of both charges. 1)The evidence was sufficient to establish breaches of s.8 and s.9 of the Charter. The Certificate of Analysis constituted conscriptive evidence which, on balance, would not have been discovered by alternative means. Its admission into evidence might render the trial unfair and bring the administration of justice into disrepute. In the absence of the Certificate of Analysis, the evidence was not sufficient to prove the offence under s.253(b) beyond a reasonable doubt. 2)The strong smell of alcohol and somewhat bloodshot or glassy eyes were not sufficient to conclude there were reasonable and probable grounds for the demand. The court is required to examine the evidence as a whole. Every case will depend a great deal on its individual circumstances. It was not reasonable for the officer to assume that the vehicle not moving at the lights was a reliable indicator of impairment for these purposes. The evidence of slurred speech was not reliable as there was nothing in the officer's notes regarding slurred speech, nor had it been included in the investigation documents. The accused did not have any problems with balance or manner of walk, was cooperative throughout, and did not have any difficulty understanding his rights and the breath demand read to him from a printed card. The officer did not ask the accused whether he had been drinking. 3)The nature and quality of the evidence of a strong smell of alcohol, and eyes which were somewhat glassy or bloodshot, in the context of Stellato, was so frail as to leave a reasonable doubt as to impairment. The 'classic' signs of impairment (erratic driving, strong odour of alcoholic beverage, glassy and bloodshot eyes, slurred speech and unsteadiness on one's feet) was not intended to be an all-encompassing list, and its application will very much depend on the circumstances of a given case.","The accused was charged with operating a motor vehicle while impaired, contrary to s. 253(a) and s.253(b) of the Criminal Code, and with driving while over.08 contrary to ss. 253. 8 and 9 of the Charter. The issues arose during the trial as to whether there was a breach of the accused's s. 8and s. 9 Charter rights to be secure against unreasonable search and seizure and not to be arbitrarily detained in regard to the issue of reasonable and probable grounds for the breath demand. HELD: In the absence of the Certificate of Analysis, the accused was not guilty of the charge under s. 249(a)(c) of The Criminal Code. The accused's eyes were glassy or glassy and he appeared to be slightly bloodshot. The evidence of a strong smell of alcohol was not reliable. The officer observed the accused sleeping through the two green traffic lights, and he was immediately awakened when the officer grabbed him by the wrist. As well, he was able to fully comprehend the circumstances in which he was involved. Therefore, one must consider the evidence of the strong smell and alcohol, and eyes which were somewhat glassy/maintained. The Court held that in the circumstances herein the accused had remained asleep through the green lights, he responded immediately and awoke when he took hold of his wrist. However, he also conceded that there was nothing in his notes regarding slurred speech nor had it been included in the investigation documents. The conclusion that there were no reasonable or probable grounds to make a breath demand was upheld on appeal. In the context of Stellato, the nature and quality of this evidence of impairment is so frail as to leave the court with a reasonable doubt as to impairment. Therefore the accused is not guilty."
6_2005nssc128.txt,"Pursuant to the Corollary Relief Judgment, the parents had been equally sharing the parenting time of their two children for four years. The father now applied for interim sole custody, alleging that the ongoing extreme conflict between the parties was adversely affecting the children. An assessment recommended that the children live with the father and have access with the mother. Father granted interim sole care, custody and control of the children. The serious concerns raised by the assessment satisfied the threshold requirement of a material change in circumstances; the urgency of the concerns required immediate action.","The father applied to vary the terms of the parties' 2001 Corollary Relief Judgment respecting parenting. The parties had entered into a Separation Agreement in 2000 which was incorporated into the Corollaries Relief Judgment in May 2001. The father had previously sought sole custody of the children, but the mother had refused to implement his recommendations, resulting in the children suffering. She relied on the assessment to support her concerns. The evidence disclosed that this was a high conflict couple and it was doubtful their parenting arrangements had any real chance of success. Nonetheless, the parties shared parenting arrangement had existed since 2000, albeit with much disagreement and discord. The applicant, who alleged that the mother failed to implement her assessment and recommendations, sought to continue with the shared parenting. Application to vary ordered to vary primary care to one parent ordered to be implemented immediately. Although both parents were capable parents, the evidence showed that both parents had failed to act in the best interests of their children. The obvious solution, disclosed by the evidence, was to terminate the shared custody arrangement and have the children spend equal amounts of time with the father. This was the first part of the application to vary and any future proceedings would amount to a completion of the order."
b_2018skca27.txt,"HELD: The appeal from conviction was dismissed and sentence appeal allowed. The sentence was varied to 12 months of probation. The court found with respect to each issue that: 1) the presumption of competent trial representation had not been displaced. The trial lawyer’s decision not to cross-examine the complainant was a tactical one. She was very young and had difficulty expressing herself in the courtroom whereas she had given clear, coherent statements to the police shortly after the offence. The lawyer determined that it was not beneficial to the appellant’s position to highlight those statements by raising certain inconsistences between them and the complainant’s testimony;  2) the trial judge’s assessment of credibility was entitled to deference. He correctly identified R v W.(D.) as the guiding legal principle in the circumstances and his credibility findings were supportable on the evidence; and 3) the sentence was unfit because denunciation and deterrence are secondary factors in sentencing young offenders and are to be considered in a fashion consistent with the principle of “diminished moral blameworthiness” described in s. 3 the YCJA. The court acknowledged that this offence, committed against an 11-year-old and causing her serious psychological harm, might warrant a custodial sentence but for the appellant’s exemplary conduct since the offence and the almost four years that had elapsed between the offence in 2012 and his sentencing in 2016. Under s. 3(1)(b)(iv) and (v) of the YCJA, the delay in this case offended the concept of timely justice. To impose a custodial sentence on the appellant in this case would be contrary to the purposes of the YCJA as it would impede the appellant’s rehabilitation and reintegration into society. The court decided that a fit sentence in this case would be 12 months of probation.","HELD: The appeal was allowed and the sentence imposed was varied to 12 months of probation. The court found that the trial judge committed an error in assessing the credibility of the witnesses, namely, that the complainant was only at the house for five or ten minutes and she never went into the bedroom. The sentence appeal was dismissed. It is well understood that an appellate court must show great deference to a trial judge’s assessment of witness credibility. The appellant was convicted after trial of sexually assaulting his 11-year-old niece contrary to s. 271 of the Criminal Code. The trial judge made errors in assessing credibility, his weighing of the evidence, and his findings of fact. The fresh evidence will be considered as it relates to the conviction appeal. 1) The evidence met the criteria for the admission of fresh evidence as set forth in Palmer (1979), 1979 CanLII (SCC), [1980] SCR 759 at 775 and the sentencing principles set out in R v W.(D.). The appellant had identified certain inconsistent statements in respect of which his counsel did not cross-examine the complainant. He has failed to establish these omissions amount to unreasonable professional judgment that reach the threshold of incompetence. 2) The appellant has failed, beyond that, to establish his minimal reliance on the former babysitter”s evidence to assess the condition of the complainant after the offence, which is corroborated by other evidence leading up to the critical event, including the events afterwards when she’d seen the accused leaving the house by the accused” s. 6 of the Sexual Assault Victim Compensation Tribunal. 3) The court concluded that it is more likely than not that the accused would comply with the conditions of non-custodial sentence than it is to comply with a custodial sentence. Given the seriousness of the offence and the fact that that denunciation and deterrence must take paramount importance, the appellant must establish that the appellant received ineffective legal representation at the trial and that he received ineffective trial representation. The principles of denunciation, deterrence and denunciation must take precedence over reasonable professional assistance. 4) There was no basis to interfere with the conviction."
1997canlii11078.txt,"The applicant sought to be appointed as property guardian for his uncle pursuant to s19 of the Dependent Adults Act. The proposed dependent adult resisted the application and attributed his previous difficulty managing his affairs to a severe drinking problem but indicated that he had not been drinking for six years. The uncle had never been declared incompetent to manage his affairs. He voluntarily transferred the land left to him by his father and had allowed the trust arrangement to continue since 1951. Over the years, the land was transferred from the original trustees to various other family members and was presently registered in the name of the applicant nephew. There was no dispute that the uncle was the beneficial owner.HELD: The land was vested directly in the name of Selwyn Hand. The conditional stay in place pending the resolution of this application for the appointment of a property guardian was lifted. 1)The proposed dependent adult was capable of managing a significant portion of his business affairs and matters relating to his estate and property. However he required significant independent assistance in the management of the land held for his benefit. His suggestions and proposal to sell the land and travel were reasonable and financially modest. 2)The criteria set forth in s18 for the appointment of a property guardian was met and the Public Trustee was appointed to administer the balance of the proceeds from the land sale remaining after the uncle pursued his financial commitments and his dreams.  3)Costs in the amount of $7,000 were to be paid to the applicant in the event the uncle chose to sell his land. 4)Any proposed sale would be subject to the approval of the Court upon application of Hand.

Gabrielson J. made an order returning K.W. to its parent's custody with a period of transition after receiving a psychological report on R.S. The report was very favourable to R.S. The parties agreed to Gabrielson J. receiving the report and neither party sought to cross-examine the writer of the report. HELD: Leave denied. Even if there was a scintilla of merit to the argument, the Court would not grant leave to appeal on the basis that to grant leave to appeal on an extremely technical ground would cause delay that is manifestly not in the best interest of the child in the circumstances of this case. The issue is not of sufficient significance either to the parties or to the wider public to warrant an appeal.","The Minister of Social Services applied for leave to appeal an order of a Child and Family Services judge sitting on appeal from an order in relation to the child K.W. dismissed from the bench. The child had been apprehended at birth due to the drug abuse of the mother. When the child was approximately 18 months old, the Minister sought a permanent order pursuant to s. 37(2) of the Act.

The order in Gabrielson J. clearly provided for a supervision period of only 1 year after R.S.' resumed custody of K.L. Section 27 of the act applies to protection hearings. While the Minister received new evidence, as he is expressly authorized to do by s. 63(4)(a), this did not take the form of viva voce evidence, but only of the psychological report on R. which was filed by the agreement of the parties and was not subject to cross-examination."

The result favoured joining the federation. The applicant applies under The Non-Profit Corporations Act, 1995 seeking sundry relief, the net result of which would set aside the outcome of the referendum. HELD: 1) The test emanating from the Controverted elections cases are not applicable. In debates of this type, the preferred guidance is from the test articulated in Walton (Litigation Guardian of) v. Saskatchewan Hockey Association and the related cases dealing with non-profit organizations. In those cases, the Court does not ask itself whether the results have been skewed, but rather has the organization acted in good faith and generally in accord with the concepts of natural justice? This does not mean that there must be an exacting legal process or an application of the full 'panoply' of procedural natural justice issues. The question is has the organization acted in a fashion that meets the legitimate expectations of a fair-minded observer? 2) No reasonable observer could conclude that the USC approached the post-vote process in good faith or in a fashion that is in harmony with the broad rules of natural justice. When faced with a result (rendered by a procedure which it had specifically established for the referendum) which was not consistent with its wishes, the USC simply ignored its own rules and imposed its own preordained outcome. Accordingly, the Court concluded that the USC breached its obligation to act in good faith and conducted itself in a fashion inconsistent with natural justice. The applicant is entitled to a portion of the relief he seeks. The referendum held by the USSU on the issue of whether it should join the CFS is of no force or effect.","FIAT: In October 2005, a referendum was held within the student body of the University of Saskatchewan to determine if the University OF Saskatchewan Student Union should join the Canadian Federation of Students and its related corporation, CFS-S. The result favoured joining the federation. The applicant applies under The Non-Profit Corporations Act, 1995, c. N-4.2 (Act) seeking sundry relief, the net result of which would set aside the outcome of the referendum. HELD: 1) The applicant has no standing to bring an application under s. 135 of the Act. It would be counterintuitive not to add CFS as a party to the application. 2) The conduct complained of by the applicant falls within the ambit of s. 225(1). He complains about the manner in which the activities of the corporation have been conducted. In this jurisdiction such a hearing would be appropriate. 3) The burden lies on the party seeking the right to cross-examine to show the examination will assist in resolving the issue before the chambers judge. 4) The substantive issues distill to whether Robin Mowat has standing under ss. 135 or 225 of the Non-profit Corporation Act (the Act).

6_1999skqb124.txt,"The plaintiff who had been employed by the defendant's predecessor for 23 years as office manager and bookkeeper until 1997, brought an action for damages against her new employers for dismissal without adequate notice. The plaintiff took stress leave and requested to be relieved of her duties as office manager in 1998. The action proceeded under the simplified procedure in Part Forty of the Queen's Bench Rules. HELD: 1)The conduct amounted to constructive dismissal entitling her to withdraw services without a reduction in the notice period. Although the defendant had numerous complaints the plaintiff was not dismissed for cause. Her termination of employment related only to her reduced position as bookkeeper which was for an indefinite period of time. Her employment had already been terminated by notice of nearly a year. She remained entitled to notice to March 31, 1999 at her salary at the time of termination and to medical expenses that would have been covered but without bonuses or extra payments for sick pay. 2)The defendant did not establish the plaintiff ought to have done more to mitigate her loss. There was no basis for punitive damages nor for an extension of the period of notice.  3)The net earnings between May 1998 and March 1999 were deducted after deducting $50 for the cost of qualifying for that employment. Amounts owing by the plaintiff to the defendant were to be deducted. 4)The plaintiff was entitled to interest in accordance with the Pre-judgment Interest Act. 5)The defendant could make no deduction for insurance benefit payments. Sections 45 and 46 of the Employment Insurance Act was drawn to their attention. 6)The plaintiff was awarded costs. Fees were to be taxed on column 2. 7)The plaintiff was to deliver a copy of the calculation of the judgment. Either could issue judgment with the other's consent as to form and content. An application for further directions could be made.","The plaintiff brought an action for wrongful dismissal or, stating it more correctly, for damages for dismissal from her employment without adequate notice. At trial, the affidavits-in-chief of the plaintiff's witnesses were marked as plaintiff exhibits and the witnesses were then called for cross-examination by the defendant followed by redirect questions from plaintiff's counsel. At issue was whether equal latitude may be required in the defendant's cross- examination of its witnesses. HELD: 1)The plaintiff was given written warning that at the end of the period the employment insurance benefits will remain unimpaired. The defendant can therefore make no deduction for any such insurance payments made to the plaintiff. 2)The defendant was to deduct from its liability the amounts owing by the plaintiff to the defendant prior to the date of her employment termination. 3)The parties each had a string of complaints against the other. The plaintiff was to be given a copy of the affidavit evidence.  4)The affidavit evidence was to have her name and address as well as the number and types of payables assigned to her. 5)The defendants were to deduct the amount owing the plaintiff from their credit for any payouts made to her during the period from which the action was commenced. 6)The court took note of the fact that equal latitude was required in plaintiff's cross examination of the defendants' witnesses."

She also stated that just prior to this she was awakened by the feeling of someone touching her vagina. The accused was charged with sexual assault and sexual touching of the complainant., accused found not guilty; the complainant's testimony was internally inconsistent and her cross-examination revealed obvious errors which were never corrected to rehabilitate her credit. The evidence was more impressionistic than probative of the facts alleged and the accused's evidence raised reasonable doubts in the court's mind.","The accused was charged with sexual assault and touching of the complainant. The complainant was a close friend of the accused's. She recalled that the accused had moved over and touched her breast and vaginal area while she was asleep. The accused testified that he had babysat the complainant for two years. At the time of the alleged assault, the complainant was living common law with her mother. The parties had retired to the bedroom where the accused retired to sleep. During the evening, the accused and the complainant went for a sleep over. The party had finished watching a movie and when the complainant awoke, she felt something inside her pyjamas and then moved over to the other side of the bed to watch television. When the parties' bedtime music was played, the party had retired into the living room where the rest of the party watched television. She did not see the accused move or touch her. She testified that she felt a hand on her breast, which she described as being warm and inviting. She alleged that the touching was for a sexual purpose. Accused found not guilty as charged; he enters acquittals on the record. The evidence was more impressionistic than probative of the facts alleged, which could lead a person to conclude that the Crown has proved beyond a reasonable doubt that it would be unsafe to conclude, on the total evidence and that accept, that the Court had proved."
2005nsca64.txt,"The chambers judge refused to grant an adoption to a single mother of her own daughter as he determined that the child would not gain anything vis a vis the mother by such an adoption but would lose the potential for a relationship and support from her father. The evidence before the chambers judge was meagre but showed that the father had not seen the child for the past four years. The mother appealed., appeal dismissed; the chambers judge focused on the best interests of the child and did not fail to give appropriate consideration to the factors set out in the Act. He did not place too much emphasis on the child's loss of a potential relationship with and support from the father on the facts of this case.","The appellant appealed the November 2004 decision which denied her the adoption she sought with respect to her four year old daughter. The appellant argued the chambers judge erred by failing to give adequate consideration to the factors he was required to consider in determining whether the adoption was in the best interests of the child. She argued the loss of possible contact with and support from the father would be devastating to the child's relationship with her biological father. Dismissing the appeal with reasons, that the only evidence before the judge was the usual documentation provided to court with an application for an uncontested adoption. The Minister made no recommendation with respect the adoption and did not conduct a home study. The father did not work for her employer for two years. There is no evidence as to why there has been no contact between the appellant and her father since November 2000 or whether he was or is presently able to provide financial support for her and whether the appellant ever sought child support. It is not known how the child was supported from November 2000 when the father ceased support and has not consented. Notice of the proposed adoption was given to the Minister of Community Services as required by s.76(1) of the Children and Family Services Act. The Ministry made no recommendations with respect respect to the adoption. No home study was conducted. There was a net loss to the appellant."
2_2003skpc44.txt,"The plaintiff sought to recover the purchase price and repair and inspection costs of a used vehicle pursuant to the Consumer Protection Act s.57(1)(b). Mr. Russell sold the vehicle under consignment to the plaintiff for $1,600. The sales agreement indicated the vehicle was sold 'as is'. The purchaser returned the vehicle the next day because of a problem with the seat belt, a vibration or pulsation from the brakes and the 'check engine soon light' had come on. The plaintiff paid for the sensor replacement. Triple R absorbed the other costs of repair. The plaintiff's daughter continued to have problems with the car including with lower ball joints, exhaust system and motor mounts. At issue was whether or not a consignee is a 'retail seller' as defined in the Consumer Protection Act. HELD: The plaintiff was entitled to recover the $1,600 purchase price plus foreseeable damages which included costs of repairs and inspection totalling $242.35 and costs of $20 less a reduction of $1,542.35 for the 5,000 km it was driven. 1)A consignee is a retail seller within the meaning of the CPA and accordingly Triple R was deemed to have given the warranties set out in the CPA. If the legislature had intended that consignees were not to be considered retail sellers, it would have listed them in the excluded group. Persons may be considered retail sellers even though they have no contractual relationship to the purchaser in s.55. 2)While the plaintiff did not pay a large sum of money, he could still expect this vehicle to be safe to drive. It was not safe and accordingly was not of acceptable quality. The retail seller bears the burden of establishing the exceptions enumerated in the statutory warranty and failed to do so. The vehicle was unsafe from the outset and could not be considered suitable for the purpose of providing transportation. It was unnecessary to make a finding with respect to warranty s. 48(g) (durable for a reasonable period of time). 3)This auto was substantially unfit for all the usual purposes for which, to the knowledge of the retail seller, it was being bought and accordingly the breach was of a substantial character. 4)The plaintiff rejected the goods within a reasonable period. The commencement of the present action was treated as the rejection of the product. The bulk of delay was caused by the defendant's failure to pick up and look at the vehicle (and implication this would involve repair) as agreed.","The plaintiff was not a partner in Triple R and was engaged in consignment auto sales upon the business premises of the defendant. Triple R was the sole financial benefit for this activity to go to the plaintiff. The vehicle was driven almost 5,000 kilometres. The plaintiff sought recovery of the purchase price and the costs that he had incurred for repair and inspection. HELD: 1)The plaintiff did not reject the product. The evidence established that the vehicle was unsafe to drive and was not of acceptable quality. In the circumstances the plaintiff did reject the goods within a reasonable period of time. The retail seller bore the burden of establishing the exceptions enumerated in the statutory warranty and had failed to do so. 2)The consumer protection act provides that consumer goods are to be sold within the meaning of the Act. The law clearly recognizes that there is a consignment contract between the consignor (the vendor) and the consignment company (the purchaser). There is also a contract (the sales contract) between the vendor and the purchaser. There is no contract between Triple and the plaintiff in this respect. 3)The law of contract clearly recognized that there are consignees and sales contracts. There are also contract(the sales) contracts between the parties. The consumer may exercise his or her right to reject if it is reasonably foreseeable that the problem will be remedied. 4)In this case the plaintiff was entitled to recover $1600 plus foreseeable damages. The costs incurred for repairs and inspection were $146.30 and $96.05, respectively, and totalling $242.35 were properly recoverable. 5)The court found that the plaintiff's actions were those of the vendor. The consignee was a retail seller within the Act and accordingly the $1542.35 was awarded to the dealer."
c_2017skqb144.txt,"HELD: The application was granted. The court ordered that the property be sold and the proceeds of sale take into account the amount necessary to protect the respondent father’s claim. The Partition Act, 1868 applies in the province. It did not allow the equitable principles of unjust enrichment and constructive trust to operate to create a proprietary interest. The court found that s. 4 of the Act applied, which provides a monetary remedy so that if the respondent father could establish entitlement to some amount for his maintenance and improvement costs, he would be protected for that amount for his costs.","The parties apply for partition and sale of lake front recreational property owned by them together with their brother. Each of the parties owns an undivided one quarter interest as tenants in common in the property. The property is located next door to another that until recently was the permanent residence of the parents. They are now separated and may have to be sold. The parties argue that the benefit and corresponding detriment must have occurred without juristic reason. They claim that Ronald, through the operation of the principle of unjust enrichment and resulting or constructive trusts, has contributed approximately $40,000 in materials and $40k in time to maintain and improve the property and that these improvements have added to the value of the Property. They also claim that the proceeds from the sale are over and above the contributions of the others. HELD: 1) The Court has a discretion to refuse partition under s. and s. 4. This opens the door to consider the manner in which the parties organized their relationship and whether an injustice has arisen that without equity cannot be remedied. 2) There are three elements that must be satisfied in order for a claim in unjust enrichment to succeed: there must be an enrichment of the defendant, corresponding deprivation of the plaintiff, and an absence of juristic reasons for the enrichment. The Court's Discretion Under the Act is limited to refusing partition when reasonable expectations and public policy are considered. This necessitates determining whether it is s. or s. which operates in these circumstances. If this case is governed by s. the application will be allowed as cannot see anything in the evidence that suggests that the Applicants are motived by malice or are being vexatious as those terms have been interpreted in Reed Reed (1985), [1993] SCC 10 (CanLII), [Ont. C.A.], [1995] SCR 269 (Qld) and [1996] SCBR 670 (QBR 670) in the sense that if it appears that a Sale of the Proceeds would be more beneficial to the parties then division of the property between them would not be sufficient reason to refuse the relief sought. In either case, if a sale is directed the court may or shall give all necessary or proper consequential directions. 3) There is no evidence that any of the above can be said to constitute juristic or constructive reasons for refusing a partition order. The application will have to go under the s.4(1) of the Act and not s.3(1)."

HELD: The plaintiff was awarded $30,737.93 plus costs plus pre-judgment interest. 1)The plaintiff had taken all reasonable steps to mitigate her losses. The duty is to take such steps as a reasonable person would take in his own interests to maintain his income and position in his industry, trade or profession. The former employer has no right to expect that the former employee will accept a lower paying alternative employment with doubtful prospects. 2)Reasonable notice would have been ten months.

HELD: The plaintiff's damages were assessed at $26,514.93. 1)The onus is on the employer to establish that its former employee failed to mitigate. This is not a case where a party already in breach of contract demands positive action from one who is innocent of blame. 2)Pre-judgment interest was awarded in the amount of $30,737.93 plus costs."
e_2005skqb549.txt,"There is no dispute between the parties as to the nature of the plaintiff's investment in the defendant corporation. The real issue between the parties is whether the plaintiff is entitled to the summary relief, which she now seeks pursuant to Rules 129 and 133 of The Queen's Bench Rules. It is the position of the plaintiff that the cross- examination of the defendant on his affidavit discloses that the corporation is profitable company and that s. 34(2) of The Business Corporation Act does not provide any defence to the defendants against the requested relief sought. The parties are in disagreement over the issue of the amount of dividend payments that have been made by the corporation to the plaintiff pursuant to her investment in the corporation. HELD: 1) The plaintiff's application for summary judgment does not require the corporation to redeem any redeemable shares. Rather, the plaintiff's application is one seeking summary judgment. The corporate defendant is not making payment to redeem shares, but rather following judgment however and whenever obtained, it would be subject to the normal judgment process, including execution. Such execution or enforcement of judgment is not tantamount to redemption of shares. The plaintiff provided notice in writing to the corporation that she wished to redeem all her Class E preferred shares effective March 2005. The principal amount of her shares is $214,600. It is this amount that she seeks as the substance of her summary judgment. Section 34(2) of the Act does not serve to prevent the plaintiff seeking summary judgment from the court. The effect of granting judgment, if it is otherwise appropriate to do so, does not place the corporation in a position of breaching the prohibitions contained in s. 34(2) of the Act. 2) The defendants have not demonstrated that there is real insolvency on the part of the corporation. The defendants have failed to provide responses to the undertakings. Further, the defendants have not provided any professional analysis or evidence in support of their position that s. 34(2) is applicable. 3) The amount sought to be recovered by the plaintiff does represent debt or liquidated demand as contemplated by Rule 129. The plaintiff is entitled to summary judgment against the defendant corporation for the sum of $214,600 pursuant to Rule 129. Further the plaintiff is entitled to interest at the rate of 16% from March 2005 in accordance with the Share Agreement. 4) The plaintiff has not demonstrated an appropriate basis for summary judgment against the individual defendants. 5) The plaintiff is entitled to costs.","The plaintiff commenced an action against the defendants seeking various items of specific relief and costs on solicitor-client basis. Thereafter, the plaintiff brought notice of motion seeking an order that the defendants provide an accounting in relation to specified items. The defendants made an order in February 2005 that directed that the plaintiff and her husband, who were shareholders in the defendant, Donald Beveridge, would be allowed to cross-examine Mr. Beveridge on his affidavit and the defendant was to bring with him to the discovery process all financial information and documentation, including income tax returns and assessments for the defendant and its parent corporation, Peak Enterprises Inc. (Peak). The plaintiff asserted that she had been paid in total $8,500 towards her dividend. The defendant argued that the amount sought to be recovered by the plaintiff was $214,600 and there was no evidence before the court to suggest any grounds for believing that the corporation is insolvent as required by s. 34(2) of the Business Corporations Act. HELD: 1) The plaintiff's motion does not require the defendant to make any payment to purchase or redeem any redeemable shares. Rather the plaintiff's application is one seeking summary judgment. The effect of granting a judgment, if it is otherwise appropriate to do so, does not place the corporation in a position of breaching the prohibitions contained in s.34(2). In the event that this interpretation is wrong, it is also necessary to examine the question of whether there are reasonable grounds for belief that the corporate defendant has not a defence to the action on the merits. The more pertinent question then becomes what application does s.33(2)(a) have in relation the plaintiff’s application for summary judgment against the defendant. 2) There is no dispute as to the entitlement under appropriate circumstances to redeem the defendant’ s.16 Preferred shares for the face value of the common currency. The plaintiff has demonstrated that she is entitled to the summary judgment requested. 3) The affidavit of Mr. Fehr deposes positively to the facts in question, verifies the cause of action and the amount claimed as due. The affidavit deposes that there is no defence to be had by the defendant pursuant to s.35(2)). 4) The Court was of the view that it would not be appropriate to strike the affidavit and to issue an order pursuant to Rules 217, 173(e) and the inherent jurisdiction of the Court striking the statement of defence of all the defendants. 5) It is the position of the plaintiff that the cross"
d_1997canlii14978.txt,"This was an appeal from an assessment of $5,454,000 in damages resulting from the appellant's liability to the respondent in tort for negligently prepared financial statements upon which the respondent relied in deciding to purchase the shares of a business. The appellants appealed. They argued that the trial judge, by measuring the respondent's loss on the basis that he should be put in the position he would have been if the financial statements had been accurate, had applied the wrong test. Allowing the appeal reducing the damage award to $2,745,600, that the trial judge erred in the test he applied to the award of damages. The proper test is to put the respondent as far as possible in the position he would have been in if he had not invested in the company. The damages are the amount by which the actual value of the company was less than what the respondent paid at the time of purchase.","This was an appeal from an assessment of damages flowing from the appellant's liability to the respondent in tort for negligently prepared financial statements. The appellant was a businessman living in Port Hawkesbury and the numbered company was his vehicle used to acquire the shares of ABM. The trial judge found that the respondent never would have purchased the company had he known the true financial condition of the company. He therefore awarded the amount of $200,000 to which should be added the balance of the purchase price of $10,000. This amount was the difference between the respondent's loss and the loss caused by the misrepresentations which led the respondent to purchase ABM: direct and consequential damages of $1,800,000, excluding prejudgment interest and costs.  It was impossible to perform that reconstruction. The award of direct damages was awarded against the respondent for $2,000 per share. consequential damages were awarded for the additional time, risk and expenditure incurred by the respondent as a result of the breach of contract.  1)The trial judge was aware that the trial judge would be using the correct test in assessing direct damages. He did not decide that direct damages should be awarded as the appellant had not been properly prepared for the financial statements and he did not introduce evidence as to the value of the shares at the time of the acquisition. He correctly determined that the actual value of ABMs would have been less than what the respondent paid for it. 2)There were too many variables, many of which were not addressed in the evidence. However, consideration must be given to what, if anything, should been awarded for this consequential loss."

The lottery money was spent on household finances and lost in husband's small business venture. Husband 'spent more money on alcohol than he should have'.

Husband's mismanagement of the family's financial affairs was grounds for unequal division of the property:","The applicant sought a division of matrimonial property, custody and maintenance for the two youngest children, aged 14 and 8 years, and custody under the Deserted Wives and Children's Maintenance Act. The parties owned modest home and equity in the said home of approximately $16,000. The respondent borrowed money and bought some trenching equipment. The trenching business failed and the home was sold. In the ensuing years there was little left. The family took more holidays and did more travelling.

Based on the evidence, the conflict in the evidence and the law, the issue of undue influence cannot be resolved without a trial of the issue.

e_2013skqb390.txt,"HELD: The Court sentenced the accused pursuant to s. 742.1 of the Criminal Code in force at the time of the offence that precluded the use of conditional sentence order for a serious personal injury offence, which included sexual assault. The Court found that the offences fell on the low end of the sexual assault spectrum as there was no skin to skin contact, the contact was brief and without violence or threats. The aggravating factors were that the accused had two previous convictions for sexual offences and that one of the victims had some cognitive disability. The accused was sentenced to a term of one year imprisonment for each count, followed by a term of probation of two years. The sentences were to be served concurrently.","The accused was found guilty, after trial, of two counts of sexual assault contrary to s. 271 of the Criminal Code. The offence occurred when the accused touched the complainant's breasts and vaginal area while she was asleep. The complainant told the accused that he had forgotten his phone. The accused then touched the victim's breasts, vaginal area and under her clothing. The victim awoke and the accused grabbed her breasts and crotch, fondled her breasts, and digitally penetrated her. The assault lasted 20 seconds. The Court of Appeal gave the accused a suspended sentence and 18 months probation. He was assessed as at low risk to re-offend, given his previous criminal record and his current state of mind. HELD: The accused was sentenced to 30 months incarceration. 1)Three years is the appropriate starting point for a sexual assault on a minor, as the offence occurred in a singular incident and the parties had no previous relationship. There was no historical or ongoing abuse of the complainant. 2)The accused is 61 years of age and had two previous convictions of sexual interference on children. He lived in Labrador and lived there until 1980. He is divorced and lives alone. He has 12 cats that keep him company. He currently lives with his girlfriend. Although there was a claim of bruising, the evidence showed that the touching was brief and no longer than a minute. The evidence did not support the allegation of physical assault, which is a serious issue in and of itself a serious offence for a minor."

HELD: The imposition of trust conditions on the disclosure of victim's statements and videotaped statements in cases of sexual assault does not prevent the accused from exercising his right to make full answer and defence as guaranteed by ss. 7 and 11 of the Charter. The obligation to disclose is not absolute. The Corwn's obligation to protect the privacy of the complainants is fulfuilled by providing the statements and videotapes to counsel for the accused on trust condition that counsel retain them in his possession. The information contained therein is available to the accused and retained experts for use in preparing his defence. Since the accused knows the sustance of the complaints and, therefore, the case he has to meet, there is no danger to the fairness of the trial by virtue of the trust condition attached to disclosure. The public interest is served and the integrity of the criminal justice system is maintained when complainants are assured that staements and videotapes will not be reproduced. Application dismissed.","FIAT. The accused was charged with two counts of sexual assault. He applied for remedy under s. 24(1) of the Charter and s. 650(3) of Criminal Code compelling the respondent to provide full and complete disclosure. The sole issue for determination was whether the imposition of trust conditions on the disclosure of the victim statements prevent the accused from exercising his right to make full answer and defence as guaranteed by s. 7 and 11(a). HELD: The application was dismissed with costs.  1)The material filed by the Crown was sufficient to establish a considerable problem with the provision of undertakings in all cases, regardless of whether there was some sensitive material to be disclosed. 2)The applicant was able to review the statements on his own and away from the office of counsel. His counsel was restricted by the order to do so.  3)There can be no doubt in proper circumstances that the undertakings made by defence counsel to the accused are necessary in order to ensure the protection of the privacy of the complainants. However, the privacy and safety aspects of disclosure are so important that disclosure is without a condition or undertaking. 4)The nature, extent and effect of the condition sought to be imposed on defence counsel in this case was unclear. The applicant was not abandoning his first and basic position that he was entitled to disclosure without a trust condition. It could not be maintained that the Respondent would not be able to make complete answer and defend the charge, so the stay of proceedings entered by the trial judge was not warranted. 5)The Court of Appeal disapproved of the Crown's policy of imposing conditions on disclosure in cases of sexual abuse. It is inappropriate for defence counsel as an officer of the court to impose such a condition. One of its duties is not to give disclosure materials to the public. To do so would fall short of acting responsibly as a defence counsel. 6)The respondent's undertaking that he would not make copies of any videotape of interviews with the complainant was not a condition which could be met by the applicant. The Court of Review ordered the trial to go ahead."
e_2013skqb434.txt,HELD: The Court granted the application. It held that: 1) a solicitor-client relationship was created between the applicants and the defendants based on the evidence; and 2) that the applicants had not rebutted the presumption that they had received confidential information during the meeting that was relevant to the plaintiff’s action against the defendants. That finding was sufficient to disqualify them for acting for the plaintiff.,HELD: The application was dismissed. The court found that the plaintiffs and their lawyer did not have a conflict of interest as the parties had discussed the possible purchase and sale of the plaintiff’s personal care home and that it would be inappropriate for the plaintiffs to continue to act for the plaintiff because their solicitor had advised them that the sale would be conditional upon the purchase of the home. The plaintiffs’ solicitor was not consulted by the plaintiffs but rather by their lawyer. There was no delay in the application. The reason the plaintiffs were left with the impression that the Phillips law firm was acting for both sides was because of their mutual agreement of confidentiality and because the lawyer had advised the plaintiffs that he would retain a different lawyer.
e_2011skqb467.txt,"The complainant and the accused were in relationship and came to Regina where they stayed in hotel, drank, consumed cocaine and shopped. An argument ensued about missing shopping bag. The accused was charged with two counts of uttering death threats to the complainant; unlawfully confining the complainant; assault causing bodily harm on the complainant; committing sexual assault on the complainant; breach of recognizance in having contact with the complainant. At trial, both the complainant and the accused testified as to what transpired during the argument that resulted in the charges. HELD: 1) The accused was found not guilty of sexual assault. 2) The accused was found guilty of unlawful confinement. 3) The accused was found guilty of assault causing bodily harm. The Court did not accept the accused's invoking of self-defence pursuant to s. 34(1) of the Criminal Code. The accused admitted to striking the complainant with a closed fist five times as hard as he could and the force used was excessive. 4) The accused was found guilty of threatening to kill the complainant at the hotel. 5) The accused was found guilty of uttering death threats and breach of recognizance by contacting the complainant. The Court did not accept his testimony and denial.","HELD: The defendant was found not guilty of sexual assault, assault causing bodily harm, sexual assault and breach of recognizance. The complainant swore she tried to flee several times after the melee in the hotel room, but was prevented from doing so by the defendant. She also stated that he had punched her in the face five times as hard as he could while she was trying to leave the hotel. The defendant denied these charges. On these facts, the court found that the defendant knew the complainant was trying on the hotel bed and had physically prevented her from doing this on several occasions, against her will. The Crown had proven each required element of the offence beyond a reasonable doubt and found the defendant guilty of unlawful confinement."
d_1996canlii7113.txt,"The question was whether a corporate board could breach its undertaking to remain in a small community when it had taken advantage of the government sponsored community bond program in order to establish its business. The Shareholders' Agreement obliged all shareholders to vote their shares so as to confirm the nominees of certain shareholders, thereby freezing the board composition without regard for its performance. As a result the board was dominated by the original Precision group of shareholders and even though the Government of Saskatchewan and Bondco were entitled to enough votes to exercise control of the company, they could not change the board and did not have the usual ways of enforcing their wishes. Members of Bondco were concerned that jobs were being obtained in Saskatoon at the expense of Rosetown jobs and the economic spin-offs expected from their $800,000 investment were not being realized in Rosetown due to the opening of the Saskatoon facility. An application was brought under s234 of the Business Corporations Act. They sought a restraining order enforcing the covenant, an order appointing new directors, an order of compensation for breach of contract and an order directing the closure of the Saskatoon operation and the return of company assets to Rosetown district unless Bondco granted written consent. HELD: It was ordered that 1)the Shareholders Agreement was amended deleting the offending paragraph concerning the Board of Directors and substituting a new paragraph; 2)certain provisions of the Articles of Continuance as amended were suspended until the Termination Date; 3)the present board was suspended pending the election of directors at a special meeting of shareholders; 4)the respondent was enjoined from moving its operations and from transferring or hiring employees at any place other than Rosetown District unless Bonco's written consent was filed with the Court. 5)The Chief Executive Officer was not displaced nor was the Saskatoon operation directed to be closed.  6)Bonco was entitled to its taxable costs against the individual respondents.","A motion to breach the undertaking made under the Community Bonds Act by the directors of Precision Metal Fabricating Ltd. (Precision) entered into a financing agreement with Bondco in 1991 for a period of ten years. Under its terms, the project was to remain in a small community when it took advantage of the governments' community bond program in order to establish itsbusiness. The applicant sought an order restraining the directors from voting their shares so as to confirm certain nominees of certain shareholders, thereby freezing the board composition without regard to its performance. The board was dominated by the Katzenberger group and its supporters on the board were high-handed and oppressive. It was ordered that the directors be directed to withdraw from the municipality. Pre-conditions to the move were set out in s. 234 of the Business Corporations Act. If the applicant has any intention of returning to the small community, or if the directors have exercised their power in a manner that is oppressive or unfairly prejudicial to, or which unfairly disregards the interests of a security holder, the Court may make an order to rectify the matters complained of. Some of its options are set out under s. 233 of the Act. The Court has the right to amend the articles or bylaws or unanimous shareholders' agreement. It may make changes in the board of directors. The facts of this case are not in dispute. The rationale of the directors to act in breach of the Financing Agreement is that the company's best interests are served by its being in Saskatoon because facilities, and perhaps labour, are in better supply there. The clear purpose of The Community Bonds act was to bring about the continued economic development of regions such as Rosetown. It is not breach in the duties of a director to condition his response to business questions by adhering to the principles of that Act."

8_2009nssc261.txt,"The Trustee opposed the bankrupt's application for a discharge on various grounds. The bankrupt supported four children and had been discharged from the military due to illness arising from her active service. The bankrupt will be entitled to an absolute discharge once certain conditions are met, including the payment of one month's rent, the value of the horses and surplus income for nine months to the Trustee. The bankrupt's disability pension from Veterans' Affairs was not included in the calculation of surplus income as the public policy reason behind the exemption for proceeds received due to personal injury and a soldier's danger pay applied to this disability pension. The Trustee had no claim to the insurance proceeds received by the bankrupt following the loss of her home by fire as it was a modest sum used to replace lost personal exempt assets; the three horses were found to be owned by the bankrupt as opposed to her children, for whom she had purchased them as pets and were included in the value of her estate; the court exercised its discretion in determining the amount of surplus income, noting that the administration of the estate had been unusually hostile and it was important that the bankrupt be able to stabilize her family finances.","The respondent was asked to discharge her assets from her estate. She had received funds from her insurer for the purchase of her present residence and had undertaken an extensive rehabilitation program. She now asked that she be discharged from bankruptcy. Various issues were raised at the hearing, including whether the respondent should in one way or other compensate the trustee for the monies she had already paid for the move and whether she should be allowed to keep the horses. HELD: The respondent was entitled to an absolute discharge. 1)The respondent's evidence that she received funds for her move did not support her claim that this money is exempt. It was accepted that the respondent had made an offensive statement to her and that her statement of need should not be considered as income for the purposes of calculating surplus income. 2)The trustee was not asked to make a detailed analysis of what is exempt and what is not exempt. She was only asked to place values. Technically with the bankruptcy, the respondent has made an effort to obtain the information necessary to complete the income tax return. 3)The court found that the trustee had not properly considered the value of the three horses. It would be inappropriate for her to pay surplus income of $325 per month for the basic bankruptcy period of 9 months, given that the three horse trailers were not declared assets but rather belonged to her children. 4)There was no evidence before the court as to their worth or significance. The respondent had clearly failed in her duties in the administration of her estate, which included providing information for the filing of income tax returns."

He signed a 5-year, 10 mile non-competition clause in 1995. He quit in early March with the intention of opening a new drug store down the street in early April. Other key staff members intended to quit and work in the new store. The applicant moved for an interim injunction to prevent the respondent from opening his store pending the hearing of their motion for an interlocutory injunction. Interim injunction granted. The new Civil Procedure Rules (2008) distinguish between interim and interlocutory injunctions. This is one of the circumstances which was contemplated when the new Rule 41.04 was enacted. Urgency exists and the applicant can't wait. While the non-competition clause may well not survive a challenge at the full hearing of the interlocutory injunction motion, all the applicant needs to show is that there is a serious issue to be tried. There is. This isn't a frivolous or vexatious application. There's a high potential for the applicant to suffer irreparable harm (e.g. the loss of customers, market share) especially given that this is a small community. An interim injunction will only result in a delay of a few weeks. The interlocutory injunction is set to heard at the end of April. The stakes are higher for the applicant than they are for the respondent.","The plaintiff brought a motion for an interim injunction to quash the defendant's attempts to enter the drug store business within 10 miles of the plaintiff.

The plaintiff had not had sufficient time to gather all of the evidence it wished to present on an interlocutory motion. HELD: The court granted the injunction. 1)The court was of the view that the hearing of the interim injunction should be full and consider all of its evidence. 2)This was not a frivolous or vexatious application. The defendant was facing a serious threat to its business and it had a reasonable argument that this Court should examine the situation and perhaps intervene. 3)The applicant was also facing the potential of irreparable harm, which would be huge if the injunction were granted.  4)The opening of the new business would have a huge effect on the business.

e_2014skqb265.txt,The determination of whether the trial judge’s conclusion regarding the officer’s suspicion was reasonable was question of law subject to the correctness standard. The respondent conceded that the officer had the requisite subjective belief that he had alcohol in his body so the appeal centered on whether the objective test had been met. The appeal court did not find any basis to disturb the trial judge’s finding of fact as to the factors the officer based his suspicion of alcohol consumption on. The court noted the trouble with the fact that the respondent admitted to drinking alcohol that “evening” but the stop was at 5:00 am in the morning. The trial judge disregarded the respondent’s admission to drinking because there was no smell of alcohol and the trial judge said there should be if the consumption was recent. The court concluded that the trial judge erred in dismissing the alcohol consumption admission. A reasonable person would have assumed that the officer’s question was with respect to recent consumption of alcohol not an earlier irrelevant time. It was also found reasonable for the officer to believe the consumption was recent. The court concluded that a reasonable person standing in the officer’s place would reasonably suspect that the respondent had alcohol in his body. An answer by an accused person that they have been drinking was found to be stronger support for a suspicion than the smell of alcohol. Because the respondent’s Charter rights were not breached a new trial was ordered.,"The accused was charged with impaired driving contrary to s. 253(1)(a) of the Criminal Code and operating a motor vehicle when the blood alcohol concentration exceeded 80 milligrams (alcohol) per 100 millilitres (Criminal Code s.253(2)(b)). He was acquitted of both charges. The Crown appealed the acquittals of the accused and the conviction of impaired driving. At trial, the accused challenged the reasonableness of the investigating officer's suspicion upon which the officer based his ASD demand. HELD: The appeal was dismissed. The trial judge specifically found that the accused relied only on three factors in forming his suspicion. This is a finding of fact and there is no basis for disturbing it. 1) On appeal, the trial judge reviewed the meaning of reasonable suspicion set out by the Supreme Court of Canada in R. v. Labbe, 2012 SKCA 63 (CanLII), [2009] S.C.R. 527. 2) The Court of Appeal in Saskatchewan also commented on the s. 24(2) Charter remedy. It was held that, in the circumstances, the officer had reasonable suspicion but his dealings with the accused were less than what society should expect from a police officer who has been trained in the use of the ASD."

A period of probation was appropriate but 3 years was out of proportion to the nature of the offence.

The Crown admitted that there was no nexus between consumption of alcohol on the part of the appellant and his propensity to paedophilia.

c_1998canlii14058.txt,"FIAT. An application pursuant to Rule 188 for a determination of whether the defendant was liable pursuant to s86(1) of the Highway Traffic Act for the personal injuries of the infant plaintiff or was immune from liability by virtue of s228 [now s232] of the Education Act. The second point of law to be determined was whether the co-defendant as car owner was liable if the driver was found to be immune from liability. The motor vehicle accident occurred while the infant plaintiff was being transported during a field trip, approved by the defendant school board, and the defendant was the teacher. HELD: 1)The teacher/driver was acting within the scope of her duties and was immune from liability by virtue of the Education Act. 2)The owner was only liable to the same extent as the driver. The reasoning in Neault was directly on point. Just as the Workers' Compensation Act and the Highway Traffic Act prevent the injured worker from suing the owner of the vehicle because he is prevented from suing the driver, the Education Act extends the same immunity to the owner as it does to the driver by operation of s86(1) of the Highway Traffic Act. 3)There was no apparent conflict between the statutes. When read together, the legislation provides that a negligent teacher is granted immunity from liability if the teacher has acted within the scope of the Education Act. The Traffic Act is the general statute, governing liability of all drivers. The Court did not agree with the School Board's analysis that the Education Act was the general statute. 4)The injured plaintiff was not denied a party to sue for negligent operation of a vehicle as he had recourse against the school board and its insurer. The immunity under the Education Act only applies to teachers and principals.","FIAT. The school board applied for a determination of whether the defendant was liable for s. 86(1) of The Highway Traffic Act for the personal injuriessustained by the infant plaintiff, or whether the Larsen was immune from liability by s. 228 of The Education Act. HELD: 1)In the event the defendant is not liable, the plaintiff's immunity extends to the owner of the motor vehicle.  2)The Education Act is the general statute governing liability of all drivers of motor vehicles. The immunity only applies to teachers and principals. 3)The school board was not able to find in favour of the Board the argument that the teacher's immunity was an exception to the general liability provisions of The HELD Traffic Act. The teacher was not liable to the plaintiff, neither was the driver. 4)The argument that there was an apparent conflict between the two statutes was not supported by the fact that the Education Act specifically provides an immunity to a teacher when acting within the scope of s.228 of the HELD Act. It was logical that the argument about whether the school board should be bound by the provisions of the Highway Traffic act extended to the teacher. The reasoning in the Neault case was directly on point. Just as the Workers' Compensation Act and the Highway Pollard Act prevent the injured worker from suing the employer of the vehicle because he is prevented from suing that driver, the Education act extends the same immunity to the employer as it does to the driver by operation of the same s.86(1)."
5_2004skqb417.txt,"Each party has applied for a variation of the judgment granted by Gunn J. in April 1999. The judgment incorporates the terms of an Interspousal Contract dated April 1999 that provides for basic child support to be paid by the petitioner in the amount of $1,411 per month. The calculation of child support in the Interspousal Contract was based on the petitioner earning $110,000. The petitioner seeks to have child support reduced for Kimberly and discontinued for Ashley. The petitioner has unilaterally terminated support for Ashley on the basis that she is over 18 years of age and not in full time attendance at school. The respondent seeks an upward variation of ongoing child support for Kimberly on the basis that the petitioner's income is significantly higher than $110,000. She also seeks a retroactive variation of support paid for both girls. HELD: 1) The parties agree that much of the petitioner's income since the separation has included significant amounts of non-recurring income in the form of capital gains, stock options and severance pay. In accordance with s. 16 of the Guidelines, a payor's income for child support purposes is determined based on total income, adjusted in accordance with Schedule III, as shown on his or her income tax return. The petitioner has provided no compelling reason to exclude any of his non-recurring income. To the contrary, it is the fairest way of proceeding. The petitioner's income since separation discloses that non-recurring income can realistically be anticipated in the future, as it has constituted a significant portion of his income in four of the last five years. The fairest way of determining the appropriate level of child support is by calculating it based on his income during the previous year. 2) The petitioner's line 150 income on his 2003 income tax return was $199,922. This includes $114,454 of non-recurring capital gain income from the sale of shares in Poplar Hill Resources. It does not include the non-taxable portion of that capital gain in the same amount. Pursuant to Clause 6 of Schedule III referred to in s. 16 of the Guidelines, this non-taxable amount is to be included as an adjustment to income. This results in the petitioner's 2003 income for child support purposes being $314,376. However, in examining documents provided by the petitioner regarding his previous year's income, it is apparent that he incurred net capital losses in 2002 of $65,424. The Court imputed $150,000 of income to the petitioner for the year 2002 despite this net capital loss and his line 150 income being only $2,410. It is therefore reasonable that this capital loss be deducted from the non-taxable portion of the capital gain he realized in 2003. This results in only $49,030 of the non-taxable portion of the 2003 capital gain being added to income for total income of $248,952. Based on the Guidelines, child support of $1,928 would be payable for Kimberly.  3) During the same year that the petitioner was enjoying income in excess of $248,000, the respondent's income for herself and the two children was only $24,345. It is self-evident that the petitioner has a substantially greater ability to provide financial support for Kimberly than does the respondent. In the circumstances it is appropriate that one-half of the Guideline amount for the petitioner's income in excess of $150,000 be payable as child support. Effective January 1, 2004, the petitioner shall pay monthly child support for Kimberly of $1,557.  4) Ashley did not complete grade 12 until June 2003. In the normal course, she would have graduated in June 2002, but she was short some classes. The required classes were not available in September 2002 so she did not return to school until the new semester in January 2003. Although Ashley was not in full time attendance in school during the last six months of 2002, she had not yet completed her basic education and had every intention of doing so. She was not in a position to withdraw from her parent's support. Considering the disparity in the ability of each of her parent to contribute to her support, it is appropriate that support for Ashley be the amount determined by applying the Guidelines as if she were a child under the age of majority.  5) A written request by the respondent for the petitioner to provide copies of his income tax returns is not required because the parties incorporated a positive obligation to exchange tax returns in their Interspousal Contract. Consistent with the objectives of the Guidelines and implicit in the Interspousal Contract the parties must have understood that the petitioner's child support obligation could change if his income changed. 6) This is clearly a case where a retroactive variation is warranted. No variation can be considered for 1999, the year of the Interspousal Contract and the judgment. Given the various sources of the petitioner's income and the significant annual fluctuations in his income, it is appropriate to use his previous year's income as the basis for calculation of his child support payable in the subsequent year. The Court went on to calculate the petitioner's income and the child support payable for each year. 7) In 2002 the petitioner's line 150 income was only $2,410. Given the pattern of the petitioner's income in the three preceding years, along with the fact that he disposed of capital assets in 2003 that generated undisclosed cash flow, and, some 2 years later, he nevertheless retains significant net assets, the Court imputed additional income to the petitioner of $150,000 for child support purposes. 8) The respondent was awarded costs set at $2,600.","Each party applied for a variation of the 1999 child support order which provided for basic child support in the amount of $1,411 per month. The 1999 judgment incorporates the terms of an Interspousal Contract. The parties separated in 1997 and shortly thereafter Mr. Marzolf moved to Alberta. The plaintiff commenced negotiations in 2002 for a retroactive upward variation of child support. Negotiations proceeded slowly and the plaintiff eventually countered with an application for variation in March 2004. The court had discretion as to whether the Guideline amount or some other amount should be used to calculate child support on an income in excess of $150,000. It was reasonable to impute additional income to the plaintiff because of the dramatic increase in her income in the past few years, combined with the fact that he disposed of capital assets in 2002 that generated undisclosed cash flow and some two years later he nevertheless retained significant net assets. The plaintiffs income for 2002 was $248,000 and the amount owing to the respondent was $1.186 per month for the same year. Based on the Guidelines and an annual income of $248000, the court found that the respondent had a substantially greater ability to provide financial support for the plaintiff than does the plaintiff."
d_1998canlii4665.txt,"The primary issue in this appeal was the standard of review to be applied on appeals from a Hearing Officer to the Workers' Compensation Appeals Tribunal. The appellant had his appeal denied on the grounds that the decision of the Hearing Officer was not patently unreasonable. Allowing the appeal and remitting the matter for re-hearing, that an appeal from a Hearing Officer to the Tribunal is a statutory appeal. It is not a judicial review, and the standard of review is therefore one of correctness not whether or not the Hearing Officer's decision was patently unreasonable. The deference that the Tribunal must show is only with respect to the advantages the Hearing Officer may have in the fact finding process of a particular case.","This was an appeal for leave from a Worker's Compensation Appeals Tribunal decision which dismissed the appellant's appeal from the decision of the Hearing Officer finding that he was not entitled to temporary total disability payments under the Workers' Compensation Act. The appeal was limited to question as to the jurisdiction of the Tribunal and to the usual appellate deference to trier of fact. This Court in Doward, supra dealt with the standard of review by the Tribunal of decision of hearing officer at pp. 33-38, 160 N.S.R. (2d) 2. There is no reason to think that the Tribunal is any less expert generally in matters relating to workers' compensation that fall within s. 243(7) than the hearing officer. The Tribunal must, in such cases, afford the usual judicial deference. Support for this approach can be found in the very wide scope of review of the tribunal's decision given to the Tribunal by s.243(7)(e). An appeal to the tribunal is a statutory appeal. It is not a judicial review. The concept of patently unreasonable decision has no place in this statutory appeal process. The court reviewed in detail the advantages and disadvantages conferred by the tribunal in concluding that a hearing officer erred in finding that the inference being sought by the worker was not reasonable one. The benefits were awarded to the claimant who claimed the knee problem arose from and in the course of his employment."
3_1996canlii6732.txt,"The plaintiff sued his father's estate for breach of a farm lease and for the value of his farm labour. The estate counterclaimed for a mortgage debt incurred by the father on behalf of the plaintiff. The plaintiff was not included in his father's Will as a beneficiary and the Will contained no reference to the mortgage debt. The father's statement of assets filed in his divorce and matrimonial property action did not disclose it as an asset. HELD: 1)The unsigned handwritten memorandum evidenced a binding agreement for lease between the plaintiff and his father. He affirmed the lease in his discussions with a daughter. 2)The plaintiff neither repudiated the lease nor failed to complete his obligations under it.  The fact that he did not vigorously contest the right of his brother to farm the land on behalf of the estate did not estop him from suing for damages for his father's breach of the lease.  Damages of $6,500 were awarded. 3)The plaintiff failed to establish a quantum meruit claim. He did not produce any documents to show he had been reimbursed for his labour on the farm in prior years. Other family members helped with the farming from time to time. He did nothing while his father was alive to demand or obtain payment. 4)Even if the mortgage was considered a debt in 1989 it was subsequently forgiven. It was significant that the plaintiff was not included as a beneficiary and the amount of the mortgage was similar to the bequests to the other children. 5)The plaintiff was awarded his costs against the estate on a party and party basis for that portion of his claim on which he was successful and for defending the counterclaim. Solicitor and client costs against the estate were not appropriate as the issues raised by the claim and counterclaim were not typical estate issues. Judgment issued against the two executors in their representative capacity.","The plaintiff sues his father's estate for damages forbreach of a farm lease and for the value of his farm labour. The estate counterclaims for a mortgage debt incurred by thefather on behalf of the plaintiff. HELD: 1)The lease was a valid lease and was repudiated by the plaintiff after he commenced his claim for damages. The plaintiff did not vigorously contest the lease nor failed to complete his obligations under it.  2)The plaintiff was only entitled to the net return he would have realized had he farmed the land in accordance with the lease in 1994 by the executors of the estate. The fact that the father, in the heat of an argument, arbitrarily and without justification repudiated the agreement does not estop him from suing the estate fordamages for his breach of the lease. 3)The issues raised by the claim and counterclaim are not typical 'estate' issues. Solicitor and client costs against the estate are accordingly not appropriate."

J.A.’s mother was found to be a person of sufficient interest under s. 23 of the Act. The court ordered that the child should be placed in the custody of J.A.’s mother as a person of sufficient interest for a period of four months pursuant to s. 37(1)(b) of the Act. The child’s parents should have adequate access to build their relationship with him and to allow them, with the assistance of others, to come up with a plan that would allow them to eventually care for their child.","HELD: The child was placed in the custody of the Minister of Social Services for a fixed period of 4 months. This was a sad case as most proceedings under the Child and Family Services Act are. Two very young parents who want to care for their infant son, who is in the care of grandmother TK, but the Minister did not proceed with the application and the child was allowed to take the baby home with her. The parents were not able to provide the child with the care he needed and, in fact, there was some anger management issues that were yet to be dealt with. The child had been apprehended by the Minister's staff, who had received a maternity alert from their office, and they had been unable to contact the child. The Minister had ordered that the child be placed with TK as a person of sufficient interest for a period of four months. That period is of shorter duration than the six months suggested by Minister. Given a variety of reasons, the parents have not had adequate access to their child so as to build a more positive relationship with him."
2_2006nsfc7.txt,"Although the mother initially had sole custody of the parties' two children, they were placed in the joint custody of both parents, with primary care and control with the father, when the mother was hospitalized due to mental health disturbances. When the children were not later returned to her care, the mother brought an application to vary the primary care arrangements, alleging that the children were not receiving suitable and appropriate parenting while in the father's care. The father, who lived close to the maternal grandparents and relied upon them extensively for the care of the children, questioned the mother's emotional and mental health and stability. The transfer of primary care of the children to the mother is conditional upon the fulfillment of several provisions and prohibitions, including the mother's disclosure to her mental health caregivers of any alcohol consumption and the recent harassing phone calls made by her; should the parents be unable or unwilling to cooperate with the court directives, the court will consider filing a report of neglect under the Children and Family Services Act; primary care and access will be reviewed by the court in six months time. The children were at considerable risk if placed in the primary care of either parent; the evidence showed that the father was unable to meet the children's needs on a daily basis; in addition to his questionable parenting judgment, his regular daily drug use in circumstances where the family lived in poverty and one child had an asthmatic medical condition showed that he placed a higher priority on his relationship with marijuana than his primary responsibility as protector of his children. Although the mother's parenting plan was well-conceived, the court questioned whether she could withstand the daily pressure of raising the children and noted her past habit of consuming alcohol while taking medication.","The parties were involved in a dispute regarding the primary care of two children who were in the mother's care. The mother had recently been diagnosed with Bipolar Mood Disorder and was unable to drive a motor vehicle. The father, who was currently employed as a roofer, was dependent upon the maternal grandparents to transport the children for medical and dental appointments and from time to time there was a running water problem in his home. The children were at considerable risk if placed in the primary custody of either parent. HELD: The primary care issue was that the children were exposed to substandard hygiene, were exposed daily to daily illicit drug use by the father, were physically and emotionally assaulted by his relatives, and had been subject to violent physical and verbal attacks by the husband. The primary concern of the mother was that her children would be at risk while in the father's care due to their current mental health problems. The evidence before the Court was that there would be a significant adverse effect on the children if they were placed in primary care or control of the father. The symptoms of depression were found to be consistent with regular appointments and even in the face of extraordinary circumstances concerning the present litigation, the children appeared to be doing well. However, the mother continued to make threatening phone calls to her sister and other family members and, in some cases, the father himself. The grandparents were called by the court but did not proceed with full investigation. As the father was not employed and could not afford to travel to and from work, and the mother had a history of short term relationships with other men, the court was concerned that his visits to the mother would lead to problems for the children once they were in his care. Further, there was the possibility that the mother may have other problems if she continued to participate in his treatment program."

A judgment was rendered, dividing the matrimonial property and dismissing the appellant's claim for maintenance. The appellant now appeals on the ground that the trial should not have proceeded without him. HELD: The appeal is dismissed. 1) There is no error in the decision of the trial judge. The medical evidence did not indicate any inability to either instruct counsel or to represent him in Court. The trial judge had little choice but to do what she did. 2) The authorities cited by the appellant have no application to this case as they all deal with situations where someone did not appear at his trial. In this case, the appellant appeared but refused to participate. For the same reason, Queen's Bench Rule 271 has no application.","The appellant appeared for his trial in matrimonial matter after a peremptory adjournment.

The court offered several accommodations to encourage him to participate, including allowing his friend to sit with him, provision of written instructions on the conduct of trial by self-represented litigant, time for consultations and preparation during the trial, and private room for consultation.

b_2002nsca30.txt,"A fifteen year old died in a motor vehicle accident. The estate brought a claim for loss of future income and lost earning capacity. The Chambers judge found that such a claim was not available and the estate appealed. Appeal dismissed; the context of the legislation, its purpose and text all support the conclusion that the deceased's loss of prospective earnings is not an actual pecuniary loss to the estate.","Where a person is killed due to the fault of another, the person's estate may sue the wrongdoer for certain damages which have resulted in 'an actual pecuniary loss to the estate'. The main question to be decided in this case is whether the earnings which the deceased would have likely have earned had he not been killed are 'an actually pecuneiary loss' and are, therefore, recoverable by the estate in an action against the Wrongdoer. The Nova Scotia survival of actions legislation contained several exclusions and limitations not found in the earlier Ontario and English legislation. These limitations were not met in the Nova Scotia legislation which excluded causes of action for adultery and inducing spouse to leave or remain apart from his or her spouse. Alternatively, the respondent argued that this claim was for loss of expectation of life and was therefore excluded from the survival of action legislation. Allowing the appeal, that the provision that limited recovery of damages from causes of actions in common law to 'actual pecunia loss' was not outdated and the provision which excluded certain punitive damages for 'loss of expectationof life' was, in fact, a straightforward issue to determine."

ISSUES: 1)Did Sedco register its interest in accordance with the PPSA Regulations? 2)If not, can the registration be cured under section 66 of the PPSA? HELD: 1)The personal registration did not comply with the PPSA Regulations. The registration against the trade name was proper. 2)This is a matter where section 66 should be applied. To hold otherwise would result in an undeserving windfall to unsecured creditors who have not been mislead.","This was an application for an order pursuant to s. 135(4) of the Bankruptcy and Insolvency Act.

The trustee appeared late on the scene and has never incurred any risk. It never acted on the financing statement containing the error. The Trustee has not been misled, has not received notice of the security interest and has not acted to its detriment.

2_2007nsca122.txt,"Two days after the wife commenced a divorce action in Nova Scotia, the husband commenced one in Texas. He successfully applied to have the wife's divorce petition set aside on the grounds that she had not been ordinarily resident in Nova Scotia for at least one year immediately prior to the commencement of the proceeding. The wife applied for a stay of execution pending her appeal of this decision. She argued irreparable harm to herself and the parties' child on the basis that if the stay was refused, she would be required to travel to take part in the Texas proceeding, leaving her law practice for an extended time and uprooting the child who was settled in school here. She also feared that she would be found in contempt for failing to obey the Texas custody orders and be imprisoned. Application for stay pending appeal dismissed; the irreparable harm claimed by the appellant was entirely speculative at this point as if the Texas court did grant custody to the father, under the Child Abduction Act, a Nova Scotia court would have jurisdiction to determine the child's habitual residence and whether the appellant was wrongfully detaining him here. Given that the Texas court would be free to continue its proceeding even if a stay was granted, until such time as the conflict of laws issue was resolved, it would be risky for the appellant not to participate in the process there. Furthermore, the order under appeal was not one that lent itself to being stayed under Rule 62.20.","The appellant appeals from a stay of execution of an order setting aside her petition for divorce. On an application by the respondent to set aside the divorce petition on the basis that Nova Scotia lacked jurisdiction, the judge determined that the appellant had not been ordinarily resident in Nova Scotia for at least 1 year prior to the filing of the petition. The order is set aside and declares that all interim orders, interlocutory orders, execution orders and judgments in the proceeding are void. Included in the interim orders are interim orders giving custody of the eight year old child of the marriage and providing for access, child support and spousal support. As well, an order releasing the respondent's interest in the Nova Scotia matrimonial property is subject to accounting at a later date. HELD: The application for a stay pending appeal is dismissed. Costs in the cause. 1) While there is no comprehensive definition of what may constitute 'exceptional circumstances' which may justify a stay even if the applicant cannot meet the primary test, those exceptional circumstances must show that it is unjust to permit the immediate enforcement of an ordered obtained after trial. This is not a case where issuing a stay would prevent an injustice. 2) There are no special circumstances created by the passage of time which would permit a stay to be granted in this case. The decision of the trial judge was merely declaratory and does not call for or contemplate any consequential relief or require the taking of any further steps to enforce it. This rule does not provide for a staying 'decision', rather it calls for'stay of proceedings under the order appealed from'. In other words, the stay contemplated by Rule 62.15 applies to proceedings to enforce or give effect to a decision not to the decision itself which has already been rendered. Once the appeal is allowed, the appellant would be in position to present her forum conveniens and best interests of the child arguments to Nova Scotia court."

Each party will bear their own costs; the court had no confidence that any offer made by either party, short of 100 per cent vindication, could have resolved the case in advance of trial.","The court found that both parties contributed to the length of the trial, complexities of the issues and the attitude of the parties leading up to and during the trial. Both parties contributed by way of a formal offer to settle in the amount of $60,000. This offer was not accepted by the plaintiff and she recovered $64,147.85 after trial. The defendant sought to recover costs from the plaintiff, arguing that they should bear their own costs and that the plaintiff was the party most responsible for the necessity of this trial. In issue was whether the court's after-trial perception should be disturbed as result of the above submissions and the defendant's refusal to recognize proper deficiencies that should have been resolved pursuant to the building contract. There was also an element of this joint contribution in relation to the septic system. HELD: 1)There was no clear winner in this case. In fact this is one of those cases where success and failure are shared almost equally.

2_2007nssc40.txt,"Following the collapse of the roofs of two buildings in Newfoundland, both of which were constructed with open web steel joists fabricated by the same company, the Nova Scotia government wrote to owners of buildings containing these joists, including the plaintiff mall owner, recommending that the joists be inspected by a qualified professional engineer. An inspection of the mall roof revealed that 10.5 per cent of the joists inspected had at least one panel point with a broken or missing weld and the same remediation scheme as that implemented by the Province for the government's own buildings was recommended. The plaintiff, concerned with safety issues arising from the report, followed the consultant's recommendations and undertook remediation of the mall and then claimed against the defendant, which was the parent company of the corporate entity which had fabricated the joists. The defendant's expert took the position that although the actual repairs to the welding and webs of the open steel joists was necessary, the reinforcing of the joists undertaken in the remediation was not required in order to mitigate the danger. Judgment for the plaintiff; there were defects in the open web steel joists at the mall which constituted a real and substantial danger to the occupants; this danger was caused by the defendant's negligence and the remediation program carried out at the mall was necessary to alleviate the real and substantial danger. There were internal problems with the welds which could not be discovered by non-destructive inspection and the lack of proper welding procedures and quality control issues at the company prevented one from having confidence in any welds fabricated by them, at least based on external observations.","The plaintiff obtained a number of open web steel joists from the respondent. The defendant proceeded to inspect the joists at various locations throughout the world. The court was concerned that the quality of the work performed by the respondent was not satisfactory and questioned whether the repairs and remediation undertaken by the defendant were required to alleviate the danger. In issue was whether the respondent's joists were subject to the stringent quality control required by the federal government for their construction and operation. The respondent admitted to having fabricated and delivered the open-web steel joist, but alleged that his division was not responsible for the quality control issue. The plaintiff alleged that the respondent had failed to provide proper quality control to the building owners. HELD: The respondent was found to have produced and delivered approximately 22,000 open web joists. Based on the opinion of Gary Follett, president of the respondent, the court found that the majority of the respondents had either broken or missing welds or were simply not able to see the welds. As the respondent failed to meet the required quality control program, the plaintiff was awarded the rest of the sum of $12,000.00. The issue was not whether the joist was subject to inspection, but rather whether the issue was addressed in a manner that would allow the court to determine whether the material met the required threshold for inspection. As far as the issue of whether the respondents were aware of the extent of the problem, they were not."

More then two years later, appellant applies for stay again. Rule 5.07 expressly forbade an application to set aside a claim once a defence had been filed. That was the factual finding in the context of exercising his discretion. The respondent had filed substantive defence and taken steps in the proceeding. Therefore the remedy of stay under s. of the Arbitration Act was no longer available to him."
9_2012skqb99.txt,"FIAT: The plaintiff sought orders pursuant to Rule 173(a) and (e)of the Queen's Bench Rules and the Court's inherent jurisdiction to strike the entire statements of defence as they failed to disclose reasonable defences; the claims asserted on statements of defence should be advanced in separate actions; and the statements of defence were abuse of the Court's process. HELD: The applications were dismissed with each defendant to recover separate costs on the appropriate tariff. Although the defendants' pleading may delay but not defeat or prevent the plaintiff from proceeding with its foreclosure action, the defences were so closely connected with the plaintiff's demands that it would be manifestly unjust for the plaintiff to proceed without taking the defendant's defences into consideration.","FIAT: A major hog producer came under creditor protection pursuant to the Companies Creditors' Arrangement Act. In the resulting reorganization two new corporations, each acquired several pig barns formerly owned by the respondent defendant. The acquisitions were financed for the purchasers by Farm Credit Canada (FCC), as primary lender, and National Bank of Canada (National). There may have been other sources of acquisition funding. The present claims for foreclosure should be dismissed or the court should declare that National is estopped from foreclosing or taking possession of secured property until the expiration of the respective three-year HTP periods. HELD: 1) The pleadings should only be struck pursuant to Rule 173 in cases where it is obvious that the claim or defence is devoid of all merit or cannot possibly succeed. Such jurisdiction should be very sparingly and only in very exceptional cases and where the court is satisfied that the claims or defence are devoid of merit. 2) National has raised reasonable defences including breach by FCC of collateral contracts which are clearly connected to the mortgages, together with equitable estoppel which precludes enforcement in circumstances such as the present. There was no reference in the HTP conditions to mortgagees. The purpose of the statements of defence is to delay the FCC foreclosure actions. There is no basis to imply improper motives. 3) In this case the plea can serve to delay, but not defeat, the FCC action. 4) The complexity of the pleadings makes it appropriate that each defendant recover separate costs on the appropriate tariff."

The respondent admitted to having two different financial reports prepared in 1992 for his company of which he was sole Director and shareholder. The company's accountant had been fined for preparing a false report and the respondent was being audited by Revenue Canada. The false report had been submitted to the Court for valuation of the company. HELD: 1)The testimony of the son who had worked for the respondent until fired for allegedly disclosing information to the mother was accepted over that of the respondent. 2)All assets were valued as the same time, the time of the application. The midpoint of the valuations was used to value the respondent's interest in the company at $192,727.00. 3)The petitioner was to receive the balance of the proceeds of the sale of the matrimonial home plus $13,500 to equalize for monies paid to clear off the respondent's writ of execution. 4)Any interest accrued on the sale of the matrimonial home was to be divided equally. 5)The petitioner received her automobile, RRSP and bank account. 6)She was given judgment against the respondent for $135,982.00 with a charge against the matrimonial assets to be registered at Land Titles. 7)$84,000 of the respondent's RRSP was transferred by way of spousal roll over to the petitioner. 8)$12,000 of the settlement proceeds from the wrongful dismissal claim were to be assigned and paid out to the petitioner. 9)All monies were to be paid within six months failing which the Sheriff was to proceed with the judicial sale of such of the assets of the respondent as may be required. 10)Judgment and a charge was ordered against the respondent for the outstanding property taxes in the amount of $15,428.64 which he was to have paid on or before October 1, 1993 by a previous court order. 11)Technology had passed the petitioner by and she had been economically disadvantaged to some extent from the marriage or its breakdown. She had upgraded but had been unable to secure employment. She was to receive $2,000 per month in support until the orders were satisfied and thereafter, $1,000 a month until her 60th birthday.  12)Costs were awarded to the petitioner on a solicitor-and client basis.","The parties were married 19 years. The parties had two adult children, a son and a daughter. After the marriage, the mother had worked part-time for the father in the industry as a key punch operator. She eventually lost her job and sought employment with the father's company. The father refused to pay her spousal support and wanted her to be at home with the children. She refused, and after completing her training, accepted a job with the city of Saskatoon. The city refused to retain her, and the father terminated his employment. The mother sought to have her assets divided among the parties. HELD: The court valued all the assets at the same time. 1)The court accepted the evidence of the mother over the father. It preferred the evidence held by the father over the counsel of the wife. 2)All the assets were valued as of the date of application. 3)The father was to pay $13,500 as equalization for monies paid out to clear the respondent's writ of execution. The court reviewed the various actions taken by the husband in the past few months and found that he had not suffered any economic hardship arising from the marriage breakdown. The objectives of the Moge v. Moge principles were to be considered in the context of the circumstances listed in s. 15(5) in fashioning an appropriate order of spousals. 4)The Court preferred the counsel over the evidence in light of the matrimonial property division. 5)It was appropriate to valuethe assets as a result of the 1993 order.  6)The respondent's interest in the company was $1,700. The value of his assets at that time was $84,000. It would be inappropriate to have two separate statements. The respondent's annual income by then was more than ten times the mother's. The trial judge found that the respondent had ample resources to support a lifestyle comparable to what she enjoyed prior to the breakdown of the marriage. The Court held that economic justice and the promotion of financial self-sufficiency were paramount."

Following discovery examinations, the great niece, who was the alternative executor appointed under the will, applied to have the executor, the deceased's husband, removed on the basis that his discovery evidence raised grave concerns about his mental capacity to continue to act as executor. Application to remove the executor dismissed; there was no medical evidence submitted in support of the applicant's claim that the executor was not competent to administer the estate and although it was clear from the discovery evidence that he did not have a clear understanding of his duties as executor, given that he was the only beneficiary under the will, he was the only person whose interest was at risk if he failed to properly administer the estate.","The applicant applied to remove the executor of the estate pursuant to s.61(1)(b)(v) of the Probate Act.

The testator, who was 99 years of age at the time of the hearing, had stated that he relied heavily on his sister (who was the sole residuary beneficiary) for assistance in dealing with his affairs. In the course of the proceeding, the estate was informed that Ms. Brooks would not be suitable executor and that the testor had no idea of the investments and activities of Mr. Conrod, a third party. As the applicant had no clear understanding of his duties as executor, he relied entirely upon his sister's answers given in discovery.

The Psychologists Act does not state that there is no appeal from a decision of the Court of Queen’s Bench.","This application concerns the jurisdiction of this Court to hear an appeal from a decision of the Court of Queen's Bench when the latter exercises jurisdiction under statute that is silent as to the right to appeal to this Court. The particular issue is whether ss. 7(2) and 7(3) of The Court of Appeal Act, 2000, which is referred to in The Psychologists Act and its predecessors, which are silent on the question, providing as it does for right of appeal by the member to the Courtof Queen'sBench only.

2006skqb536.txt,"The primary issue is whether the plaintiff, the owner of certain farm equipment consigned for sale at unreserved auction, has indirectly allowed another individual to bid on its behalf, or for its own benefit. The plaintiff corporation agreed to sell its entire inventory of farm equipment at unreserved auction for a guaranteed return of $577,500. The guarantee was given by the defendant corporate auctioneers (Ritchie). The auction was to be conducted by the defendant corporate auctioneers (LeBlanc), a newly formed division of Ritchie. After the auction sale was concluded, the defendant refused to pay the plaintiff the guaranteed price. The defendant declared the guarantee unenforceable under provisions of the 'Contract to Auction' and ultimately charged the plaintiff a commission of 14% on the gross proceeds. The defendant alleges that the plaintiff indirectly allowed another individual to bid on its behalf or for its own benefit. HELD: 1) Clause 3.07 of the Contract to Auction prohibits an owner from bidding directly or indirectly, and from allowing any other person to bid on his behalf. The issue here is whether the plaintiff allowed a family member to bid for the plaintiff's benefit. A family member can be a bona fide purchaser as well as anyone else, but the nature of an unreserved auction dictate that such relationships be disclosed to the public. The essence of the problem and the underlying purpose behind clause 3.07 is to protect bona fide bidders, and to ensure that there be no surreptitious bidding by another for the owner's benefit. 2) The plaintiff allowed Mr. Caruk to bid at the sale for the plaintiff's benefit. It went beyond the passive act of allowing him to bid. It actively facilitated bidding. Mr. Caruk acknowledged he had no money to buy equipment. The plaintiff lent him up to $100,000 for that express purpose. It is immaterial that the loan came from Mr. Tkachuk personally rather than from the plaintiff company he controls and directs. The plaintiff corporation benefited. It has leased all its cattle to Mr. Caruk and the equipment will be of significant value to the fulfillment of that contract. 'For the benefit of the owner' does not have to mean for the exclusive benefit of the owner. 3) The undisclosed arrangement between Mr. Tkatchuk and Mr. Caruk gave the nephew a significant advantage at auction. That advantage was magnified by the fact that he possessed insider information. He knew his uncle had a guaranteed price from Ritchie's for the equipment, because that information had been imparted to him by his uncle. All one needs to add is that Mr. Tkachuk would have profited very significantly had his arrangement with the nephew gone undiscovered. He would have secured a guaranteed price, while procuring the commercial advantages of having his cattle lease fulfilled using equipment the nephew could not otherwise have afforded to purchase. 4) In an area such as this where bona fides are of fundamental importance, and particularly where an owner has the advantage of a guaranteed price from the auctioneer, a deliberate non-disclosure of material information can have an impact every bit as significant as a deliberate and obvious misrepresentation. The plaintiff should have disclosed the arrangement with Mr. Caruk to the defendants. In not doing so, and in allowing and enabling Mr. Caruk to bid at the auction, the plaintiff breached clause 3.07.  5) The provision for a 14% commission on the gross proceeds of sale as a consequence of breach of a fundamental term of the contract is not extravagant or unconscionable and, as the defendants pointed out, they did not elect to exercise their conjunctive right in clause 4.05 to additional amounts as liquidated damages. The concluding paragraph would have entitled them, in addition to all other rights and remedies, to re-sell the property acquired by Mr. Caruk and to retain an amount equal to 20% of the proceeds realized. The provision for a 14% commission on the gross proceeds of sale does not constitute a penalty. 6) The defendants' claim solicitor and client costs pursuant to clause 4.03 of the contract. The defendants are prima facie entitled to costs on a solicitor and client basis, but in the circumstances there are issues whether they should be restricted to one set of costs, and other issues relating to appropriate quantum. The issue of costs will be assessed by this Court pursuant to Rule 565, with the defendants serving and filing a draft bill in the form required for a solicitor and client bill, an affidavit of disbursements, and written argument. The plaintiff shall have 14 days to reply. 7) The plaintiff will have a judgment against the defendants in the amount of $1,316.64 representing the power washing bill wrongfully deducted from the auction sale proceeds payable to the plaintiff. In all other respects, the plaintiff's action is dismissed with costs.","The plaintiff agreed to sell its entire inventory of farm equipment at an unreserved auction. The defendant, Ritchie Bros., declared its guarantee unenforceable under provisions of the Contract to Auction which charged the plaintiff a commission of 14% on the gross proceeds of sale. The auction was to be conducted by LeBlanc Auction Services. The plaintiff was first approached to become a potential customer. The contractual negotiations between the plaintiff and the defendants generated two standard form agreements, a preliminary 'LeBlanc' contract dated December 2003 and a subsequent 'Ritchie Bros.' contract dated March 28 2004. These documents raised issues of breach of contract insofar as the plaintiff's alleged failure to refurbish equipment and to allow another individual to bid on its behalf, or for its own benefit. HELD: 1) The plaintiff did not feel inescapably bound to contract with the defendants at that time. There were numerous occasions when the defendant attempted to purchase or resell the equipment at auction, and at times, the plaintiff was simply too busy to attend to details of the sale. 2) There were also numerous occasions where the plaintiff attempted to contact the defendants prior to the auction, but failed to do so. 3) In the circumstances, there are indications that the plaintiff, the owner of certain farm equipment consigned for sale at unreserved auctions, may have indirectly allowed another individual or group of individuals to bid or bid on his behalf or for the purposes of which the plaintiff seeks damages. 4) In any event, the preeminent issue is whether clause 4.05, and its 14% commission rate, amounts to a penalty clause and whether the plaintiff should be relieved of its consequences. 5) The defendants proceeded to advertise the sale extensively, taking out ads in three provinces and in the northern United States, preparing thousands of catalogues for mass distribution, and directly delivering 1,500 posters to farm yards and mail boxes in Melfort and area. Lorne Campbell, the principal shareholder and operating mind of the plaintiff purchased the equipment in 2003 and intended to sell it to the highest bona fide bidder. He was concerned that if the plaintiff bid indirectly on an owner's behalf or against a group of persons, it would void the contract. He sought damages for trespass and conversion. 6) The defendant refused to pay the plaintiff the guaranteed price. After the auction sale was concluded, the defendants refused to supply the plaintiff with the equipment. They declared its guaranteed price and charged a commission to the plaintiff. 7) There are no owner buybacks, no artificial or manipulated"
7_1997canlii11172.txt,"An application pursuant to s232(4)(c) of the Income Tax Act for a determination of whether the applicants have solicitor-client privilege in respect of 25 documents for which Revenue Canada had sought disclosure. The applicants were husband and wife, their two sons and the companies in which they were principal shareholders and/or directors. The documents related to three separate occasions upon which the applicants sought the advice or assistance of a lawyer in relation to proposed transactions. The documents in issue were originally in the possession of their accounting firm. At issue was the extent to which solicitor-client privilege could be asserted in relation to communications with and documents prepared by third parties. HELD: 1)The privilege claimed in relation to all of the documents relating to the legal advice sought after January 1995 was upheld. 2)The claim was not upheld for copies of a letter setting out the proposal for the 1988 transaction. One letter appeared to be advice offered by the accountants to the applicants.  3)The applicants abandoned their claim for privilege with respect to handwritten notes summarizing share value and fair market value of assets which had been prepared by the accountants other than for the purpose of obtaining legal advice. The claim of privilege was abandoned for a declaration of gift and minutes of a director's meeting in 1991. 4)It has been clearly established in case law that even though a client may look to his/her accountant rather than a solicitor for advice in relation to the law of taxation, the applicants must show the documents were protected by solicitor-client privilege and not merely accountant-client privilege. 5)Although solicitor-client privilege is defined in s232(1)(e) of the ITA, the issue had to be resolved in light of the common law test for privilege. 6)Privilege may extend to accountant communications where the accountant is acting as agent or representative of the client for the purpose of seeking legal advice from a solicitor. Recent cases appear to diverge on the question of the circumstances necessary to found the requisite relationship of agency. 7)The accountants were clearly acting as agents for the applicants for the purpose of obtaining legal advice, as was found in Susan Hosiery. They were at all times acting in a confidential capacity on behalf of and on instructions of the applicants. 8)Solicitor-client privilege extended to items of accounting information obtained for the purpose of receiving legal advice. Notes prepared by the accountant and the interoffice communications summarizing discussions with the solicitor also fell within the scope of privilege.","This was an application pursuant to s. 232(4)(c) of the Income Tax Act for the determination of whether the applicants have solicitor-client privilege in respect of 25 documents for which RevenueCanada has sought disclosure. The individual applicants were husband, wife, and 2 adult sons who were principal shareholders and directors of the corporate applicants. The corporate applicants were various individuals and corporations, some of which were principal directors. The respondents were all members of the accounting firm. HELD: 1)The question of whether or not the applicants had solicitor- client privilege extends to communications between the parties for the purpose of obtaining legal advice or for the purposes of anticipated litigation.  2)The accountant was acting as representative of the client for obtaining the legal advice sought from them. His role was clearly to be one of providing accounting advice to the client. 3)The 'lawyer's brief' rule was upheld on the basis that the accountant prepared notes for the client to refer to.  4)In this case, the accountant was one of the representatives of the appellant for obtaining legal advise.  5)The fact that two individuals and two companies were involved in the preparation of documents for production to Revenue Canada does not change the fact that there was overlap between the accountant and the accountant. While the accountant may be used as a representative for a purpose of seeking legal advice, but only if made for a specific purpose, his role was not merely that of providing legal advice but also that of being a conduit for information passing between solicitor and client. The central issue in this case was whether and to what extent the applicants were privileged in relation to the communications between their accountant and their lawyer.  6)Solicitor-client privileged in so far as communications between a person's lawyer and their accountant is concerned, the only privilege that exists in the circumstances is that of privilege in the sense of confidentiality of the accountant's work papers. 7)Privilege in such communications extends to documents prepared by or from the accountant as representatives of a client. 8)Theater and other evidence of privileged communications was examined in the context of a Bankruptcy case in which the accountant communicated with the client on the client's instructions, in the absence of him. 9)The relevant documents were examined by the accountant who then forwarded those documents to the applicant's solicitor for production. 10)The solicitor's brief was not privileged. It was a memorandum prepared for the appellant and not a document prepared for him or her. 11)The lawyer's brief extended to include:"
4_2016skqb160.txt,"Criminal Law – Assault with a WeaponCriminal Law – Defences – Self-defence The accused was charged with assault by threatening to use a weapon, a butcher knife, contrary to s. 267(a) of the Criminal Code. The accused was panhandling outside a store when he and one of two security officers had a verbal confrontation. The accused walked towards the security officer with a butcher knife. The security officer ran to his vehicle and the accused followed him and slashed a tire on the security officer’s vehicle. The attending officer was directed to a yard where he located the accused. A knife was also located in the yard. A videotape from the store was entered as an exhibit and played for the court. The accused was considerably smaller than either of the security officers. The accused testified that he was homeless and had a lot to drink the day of the incident. He indicated that he “blacked out” and was in front of two security officers when he came to. He said that he offered them a cigarette for being in their personal space and one of the men told him that he would punch him out. The accused indicated that he got the knife out of the bag just to show the men that he was bigger than them. He said that he did not intend to stab them. At one point the accused admitted following the security officer to his vehicle and at another point said he did not. The accused said he then tried to get away from the area but was prevented from doing so by a large black vehicle. The accused said he eventually stabbed the vehicle’s tire because it was blocking his way and he went into panic mode. The accused raised the issue of self-defence. HELD: There was no question that the Crown established the offence beyond a reasonable doubt. The court found that the accused initiated the confrontation by walking up to the security officer and getting very close to him. The court found that the Crown witness’s evidence was preferred over the accused’s where it differed, namely the slashing of the vehicle tires. The court accepted the accused’s submission that the security officer told the accused to get out of his face or he would knock him out or something to that effect. The court considered the factors set out in s. 34(2) and concluded that the force or threat faced by the accused due to the size of the security officers and the words used by one of them did not warrant the action taken by the accused. The court offered numerous reasons for the conclusion: the accused initiated the confrontation; the security guard did not touch or further go after the accused; no physical force was used against the accused; and there was no history between the accused and security officer. The accused’s actions were out of proportion to any reasonable response to any threat. The court held that the Crown established, beyond a reasonable doubt, that the facts and circumstances of the case did not give rise to the defence of self-defence. The accused was found guilty as charged.","The accused was charged with assault contrary to s. 267(a) of the Criminal Code. The accused was panhandling with a companion when he was approached by the accused, who was armed with a knife. The confrontation was described as physical and the accused threw the knife at the victim. The victim, who had been badly injured in the confrontation, ran towards the vehicle, where he was pursued by the vehicle and slashed the tire on the victim's car. The Crown witnesses testified that the accused had stated that he did not 'want to stab the victim' and that he had grabbed the knife from the back of the vehicle. The defence argued that the nature of the force or threat that was presented by the size of the accused and the words used by the defendant were not of a nature that would warrant, as reasonable, the action subsequently taken by the complainant against the defendant. HELD: 1) The accused's actions in leaving the area of the confrontation were completely out of proportion to any reasonable response to any threat that the officer may have perceived was made by the other party. This defence does not succeed. 2) There was no issue respecting the identification of the defence officer. The evidence clearly established that both Brown and Hedstrom were much bigger than the accused. The fact that the latter's apparent state of intoxication would be far more physically capable, if force were to be used, would not support a reasonable conclusion that the defendant's use of force was imminent or posed a threat to the complainant. The knife was in the hand when the accused first approached him and, in very close quarters, as the accused himself testified, got into his personal space."

1998canlii13596.txt,"Administrative Law - Judicial Review - Bias/Institutional BiasAdministrative Law - Medical Care Insurance - Medical Fees - Repayment - AppealProfessions and Occupations - Physicians and Surgeons - Cardiologist - Medical Fees_____ A cardiologist appealed an order made against him by the Joint Medical Professional Review Committee for repayment of  $207,821.03 in medical fees he received over a fifteen month period from the Medical Care Insurance Branch (MCIB). Alleged errors of law included improperly placing the burden of proof on the doctor; failing to take into account all relevant factors including the doctor's statistical analysis; considering it beyond his mandate to provide cost effective services in keeping patients out of the hospital; by using and relying on the knowledge of the Committee in preference to the expert evidence; the orders made concerning various medical services were not reasonably supported by the evidence. The numerous grounds of appeal also included breach of the rules of natural justice by reason of a lack of institutional independence. The application under Part 52 of the Rules of Court for a judicial review was brought to determine whether there was a reasonable apprehension of bias raised by the statutory roles of the Committee and Director or lack of institutional impartiality of the Committee or its lack of independence from the Director or MCIB. _____ HELD: The judicial review application was dismissed. The appeal was allowed and the repayment orders were set aside except for the orders respecting surcharges. 1)Natural justice issues: A reasonable apprehension of bias or institutional bias were not proven. The Committee provided adequate written reasons for its decision. The chairman refuted the allegations that the Committee heard and relied on evidence outside the presence the appellant about which he was not advised. Neither the Director nor the Committee acted in a prosecutorial fashion. Examples included the adjournment granted when the appellant failed to attend and the concession to his request that no cardiologist be placed on the Committee. 2)Errors of law issues: The statistical evidence could be considered by the Committee as a prima facie case. It was then open for it to call on the doctor to rebut the presumed departure from an acceptable pattern of medical practice. This did not shift the overall burden of proof to the doctor nor did it require him to prove his pattern of medical practice was acceptable to the Committee. The Committee did not err in law in misconstruing its mandate or by ignoring the statistical analysis presented by the appellant whose definition of the mandate was much narrower than envisaged by the legislation. It was not agreed that the Committee is not bound to follow the rules of evidence and the proceedings were of an investigative nature. The phrase 'balance of probabilities' means 'more likely than not'. To hold otherwise would make nonsense of administrative law and would violate the rules of natural justice. The distinction between the pattern of the doctor's billings and the pattern of his medical practice was more a matter of semantics than substance. If economics were the only consideration the review process would be a useless exercise and the statistical comparative evidence would be conclusive of the issue. There was no credible evidence that the members of  the Committee misused their expertise and relied on it rather than determining the issues from the evidence presented. 3)The appellant established that for the most part the decision of the Committee was not reasonably supported by but was contrary to the evidence. The MCIB statistics were flawed as a reliable comparison tool and the appellant's adjusted statistics were more reliable even if based on estimates rather than substantiated data. The appellant's medical practice was unique in three respects. He did not have hospital privileges and  had staff and diagnostic equipment equivalent to a cardiac care unit in the hospital; he ordered more diagnostic tests and did more follow up than other cardiologists and had extended office hours. 4)The decision of the Committee was varied to quash all repayment orders except for $14,239.76. The appellant admitted that many of the surcharges had been billed because of his erroneous interpretation of the tariff.  5)Leave was granted to bring the issue of costs back for determination if necessary.","A cardiologist appeals an order by the Joint Medical Professional Review Committee (JPMCC) that he repay $207,821.03 in medical fees received from the Medical Care Insurance Branch (MCIB). The appeal is brought under s.49.21(1) of the Saskatchewan Medical Care insurance Act. HELD: 1) The Committee failed to provide adequate reasons for its decision. The Committee gave a lengthy written decision. Although the reasons contained in the decision may not have been approved by the Committee, they are relevant and do not constitute a breach of natural justice.  2) There is a reasonable apprehension of bias raised by the roles of the director of professional review in the hearing conducted by the committee. However, this apprehension is not reasonable and is not supported by the evidence before it. 3) The evidence presented on behalf of the cardiologist was uncontroverted with one possible exception. The examineer's evidence was found to be more reliable than the average of the other cardiologists in the group. The committee's orders respecting the various medical services were not reasonably supported by its evidence. 4) There was an institutional bias which prevented the Committee from considering the merits of the case before them. It was necessary to review the evidence in order to determine whether the Committee's orders should be reconsidered. 5) Judicial review was ordered. 6) The committee acted unreasonably and failed to take into account all relevant factors. 7) It was not appropriate for the Committee to improperly place the burden of proof on the doctor. 8) In exercising its discretion, the Committee erred in using and relying on the knowledge of the members of the Committee as opposed to the uncontroverted expert evidence."
5_2006nssc353.txt,"The claimant flooring dealer had supplied and installed a large amount of flooring in the defendant's new home. Although the defendant had visited the claimant's store and selected the flooring, the actual purchase was made by the defendant's contractor who did not pay the claimant and had now declared bankruptcy. The adjudicator found that although the three criteria for an unjust enrichment claim had been met, there was no special relationship between the parties and thus, denied the claim. The claimant appealed. Appeal allowed; the absence of a special relationship will not automatically defeat a claim of unjust enrichment; the Small Claims Court has the equitable jurisdiction to determine unjust enrichment claims.","During the construction of the Dr. Paul Joseph's home by the respondent, the applicant company, Jollymore, contracted for flooring material from the appellant company, which was contracted for use in the home of the deceased. The goods were invoiced to Maritime and delivered to the respondent's home. At the Small Claims trial, the Adjudicator held that there had not been a contract between the appellant and the deceased, but there had been a special relationship between the parties. The respondent was not paid for the flooring materials. The applicant was not awarded compensation for this flooring. HELD: The Small Claims Court has the equitable jurisdiction to determine unjust enrichment and the adoption of such a view would mark a significant retreat from established principles of restitutionary liability. The Court of Appeal has found that there was a 'casual arrangement' as contemplated by Nicholson, MacKinnon, MacMillan, and Fraser, and that there must have been some nexus between the defendants' words and conduct, and the plaintiffs conferring of the benefit. The fact that there has not been any such relationship in almost all of the cases, cited here by counsel in which the plaintiffs have succeeded, is that there is an essential nexus between these words and the conduct of the plaintiffs and that of the parties, such as Joseph was aware that the work was being performed, and so it was held that no special relationship existed. Wacky, one of the subcontractors, was not compensated for floor materials amounting to value of $18,601.55 that had been ordered from and provided by the applicant's store. The plaintiff was not entitled to compensation for the floors. The defendant was awarded costs of the appeal."
8_2005skca120.txt,"The deceased made a Will appointing her only son, the appellant, as executor. In her Will, she left her home to her son, and divided the rest and residue between her two daughters, the respondents. The deceased transferred title to her house to the names of herself and the appellant jointly. She also transferred some bank deposits totalling approximately $57,000 into the joint names of herself and the appellant and designated him as the person entitled to receive payments under a RRIF totalling approximately $29,000. After her death, the appellant took the position that the bank deposits and the proceeds of the RRIF did not pass under the Will but were given to him for the benefit of the deceased's grandchildren and himself. He paid out about $45,000 to the grandchildren and himself, but nothing to his sisters, the residuary beneficiaries under the Will. The sisters brought action against him, claiming the funds were part of the residue of the estate and obtained a judgment to that effect against him. He appeals against that judgment. HELD: Appeal dismissed with costs.  1) Section 75 of The Queen's Bench Act does not apply to this case. 2) The trial judge carefully reviewed the evidence and the law respecting the presumption of advancement and the presumption of resulting trust. The judge did not mention the possibility of and express trust in favour of the grandchildren. She must have considered whether an express trust existed because that was exactly what the appellant's evidence suggested and exactly what the trial judge rejected in her findings of fact. Since the funds in question were not given to the appellant as a gift, and were not given to him in trust for the grandchildren, they must of necessity revert to the estate. In the case of the bank deposits, the funds would revert to the estate on the basis of a resulting trust. In the case of the RRIF, the funds would revert to the estate on a different basis. Since there was no gift to the appellant, and no trust in favour of the grandchildren, the monies must revert to the estate. 3) While the appellant characterized this issue as being one of mixed law and fact, it was essentially one of fact alone, the issue was what the deceased intended when she transferred the bank deposits and designated the payee of the RRIF. The standard of review in respect of such an issue is palpable and overriding error. The judge made no such error.  4) The appellant asked for relief pursuant to s. 57 of The Trustee Act in respect of the money paid by him to the grandchildren. The appellant says he paid the monies to the grandchildren in the honest belief that he was carrying out the wishes of the deceased. The appellant knew from the outset that his sisters disagreed with his position and intended to take proceedings against him. The appellant's actions in distributing the funds without at least getting directions from the Court were imprudent for a trustee. The circumstances do not justify, on any equitable basis, compelling the innocent respondents to bear the loss to them occasioned by the trustee's imprudence","The appellant executor of the estate made a few specific gifts and then left her home to her son, who was her only son. She divided the residue of her estate between her two daughters, the respondents Sandra and Leslie Gallagher. In the 1990s, the respondent transferred title to the house to the names of herself and the appellant jointly. She also transferred some bank deposits and the proceeds of the RRIF into the joint names of her grandchildren, great-grandchildren and himself. When Ms. Little died in 1999, the appellant took the position that the funds in question were to go to the appellant for the benefit of his grandchildren and great- grandchildren. He paid about $45,000 to his sisters, who brought an action against the appellant claiming that she intended the funds to be given to her grandchildren and grandchildren. The appellant appealed. Dismissing the appeal, that s. 75 does not apply to the case. It does not address the issue before the court below. The trial judge carefully considered the appellant's evidence."

2_2007nssc235.txt,"The parties, divorced, had children, aged 23, 19, and 14 years, respectively. The wife applied to vary the Corollary Relief Judgment (CRJ) following the termination of spousal support. The termination had occurred pursuant to the terms of the CRJ which provided that support would terminate either twelve months after her graduation from the M.B.A. program in which she was enrolled, six months after she withdrew from the program, or when she found employment. The wife had graduated from the program later than expected and a further six months after her course work was completed. Both parties applied to vary child support. The oldest child had completed his first university degree and was currently attending law school. Pursuant to the father's employment, until the completion of their first degree, the children qualified for a program which reimbursed the father for 75 per cent of the child's educational expenses. The CRJ had provided that the father's responsibility to pay all of the oldest child's educational expenses was conditional upon compliance and eligibility for the education reimbursement policies. The middle child was attending university and lived in the wife's home over the summer months. Spousal support application denied; given the family history of an emphasis on education and the oldest child's career plans and apparent aptitudes, he remained a child of the marriage; the father is to pay $10,000 per year directly to the oldest child for the next two years. The father will pay 25 per cent of the core university costs which are not covered by the plan for the middle child as well as the difference in the Table amount of support for two children versus one child; the father shall pay the Table amount of support for one child to the wife for the youngest child as well as that child's expenses for private school; the wife will be responsible for any extra-curricular activities or tutoring outside the private school; the youngest child will be entitled to the same post-secondary benefits in the same fashion as the two older children; the CRJ is amended to provide that the two oldest children are in the joint care of their parents and will not include any other reference to custody or access; the husband is entitled to specified block access with the youngest child; if flight arrangements are made for this child and she does not fly (and there is no medical reason confirmed in writing by a doctor for that failure), the husband's block access shall be expanded for one week at the next access period and the cost of any penalty from the missed flight will be deducted dollar for dollar from the child support payable by the husband.","The parties brought a variation application under the Divorce Act in the amount of $3,550. The parties had been involved in a dispute regarding child support since before the divorce. The mother had recently graduated from an American university and the father, who was working for the United Nations, had stopped paying child support. The father asserted that all his conversations about post- graduation studies was carried on between himself and the mother without any input from the mother; the mother had no 'input into what university would attend' and the children were not suicidal as the father claimed. The daughter's academic record from Dalhousie University is filed with the court and it appears that she has completed all of her course work and taken part in one course. However, her application to vary spousal support is terminated prior to January 1, 2007. The Corollary Relief Judgment provides that the father shall pay $1,000 per month in child support to the mother until the mother is no longer a child of the marriage as defined by the Division Act. The amount of support payable to the father will be adjusted according to the formula set out in the Corollaries Relief Judgment for January 2007. In the interim, the mother will have to pay $2,958.00 per month based on her current income. This amount is adjusted to reflect the change in circumstances between the husband and the wife. The application to continue child support is dismissed."
8_2013skqb403.txt,"HELD: The application was dismissed. With respect to the issues, the Court found: 1) that the board had not relied upon the clause in the Policy Statement but on the evidence before it. It was not necessary to decide then whether the Policy Statement was ultra vires; 2) that the board’s interpretation that the Act granted discretion to the board to refuse to reimburse a specific medical treatment was reasonable; 3) that the board’s conclusion was reasonable. The scientific studies did not definitively stated that medical marijuana was effective. In some situations where a patient’s only recourse would to be to use a non-clinically approved drug whose safety and efficacy was still questioned, a determination that the medical aid was not necessary or required might be unreasonable, but not in this case where the applicant declined to try Sativex; and 4) that there was no evidence that the board based its decision on irrelevant considerations such as the potential political ramifications of paying for medical marijuana.","The applicant sought judicial review of a Workers' Compensation Board decision denying him reimbursement for the cost of his medical marijuana. The applicant argued the Board improperly fettered its discretion by relying on the submissions of the Board's medical consultant and medical department. HELD: The application was dismissed. 1) The Board's interpretation that the Act granted the Board discretion to refuse to reimburse a specific medical treatment is reasonable. Even if Policy Statement is ultra vires, it does not decide this matter. On the face of its reasons, the Board denied reimbursement specifically because medical marijuana is potentially unsafe and unproven. The Board found that it had the power to deny reimbursement as an exercise of the exclusive jurisdiction granted to it under s. 22(1) of the Act. There is no evidence that the Board based its decision on the basis that medical marihuana is a controversial moral issue. There are no issues of general legal importance. The board was required to interpret its own statute with which it is well familiar. 2) There was no evidence before the Board that it erred in determining that medical marijuana was necessary or required for the pain relief. The decision falls within the range of possible, acceptable outcomes that are defensible in respect of the facts and law. 3) The board's interpretation of the law that the board cannot rely on a blanket prohibition to deny the reimbursement of a particular drug is not reasonable. The fact that the respondent states that it canvassed the studies submitted by the applicant and found that the studies suggested that there may be promise at some point related to the use of medical marijuana, nevertheless further research was necessary to assess the relative risks and benefits, recommended dosages, safety, quality and efficacy of the drug and whether the Board had the jurisdiction to deny reimbursements in all cases. There was nothing to suggest the Board erred on the part of it considering the medical marijuana community and its diverse background. The only thing that could reasonably lead the tribunal from the evidence before it to the conclusion at which it arrived at was the wording of the decision."
e_2009skpc9.txt,"The plaintiff claims against the defendant for water damage sustained to their belongings while in transit from Edmonton to Nipawin in a one ton, 17 foot cube van owned by the defendants. The issues are whether the plaintiffs are precluded from recovery against the defendant by virtue of the contractual term acknowledging the equipment to be water resistant only as well as the posted disclaimers to this effect. HELD: The plaintiff shall have judgment for $250 plus costs of issuing the claim and service. 1) Notwithstanding that the plaintiff signed the rental contract acknowledging that the equipment was not waterproof and only water resistant, it appears from the last three sentences of the inspection report that water was entering at the corners of the door by virtue of the door not sitting flat at the corners. This defect would have permitted excess water to enter prior to being cleaned. Perfection could not be expected since it was acknowledged that the rental unit was not waterproof and some seepage may be expected even after the door had been fixed. Nonetheless, the sealing problem would have taken it beyond the acknowledgment of the unit being only water resistant. 2) The plaintiff acknowledges that the truck remained parked outside in heavy rainfall for two days and nights prior to being unloaded. This exacerbated the scope of the damage claimed since the water would have continued to seep in unabated for roughly six times as long as the trip itself took. The Court concludes that the defendant is only 20% responsible for the damages sustained to the plaintiff's possessions.","The Plaintiffs claim $6,700.77 against the Defendant for water damage sustained while in transit from Edmonton to Nipawin in a one ton, 17 foot cube van owned by the Defendant. The Defendant denies responsibility for the damage and questions the quantum of damages sustained. HELD: 1) Whether the Plaintiffs are precluded from recovery by virtue of the contractual term acknowledging the equipment is water resistant and not water proof, as well as the posted disclaimers to this effect. 2) Quantum of damages and mitigation. The first issue was whether the plaintiffs were precluded in recovery against the defendant based upon the contractual terms acknowledge the equipment was water resistant only and the posted disclaimer to the effect. Even if the goods were transported in heavy rain conditions as the evidence disclosed, the plaintiffs are nonetheless the authors of their own misfortune by permitting the loaded truck to sit for an additional two days after reaching their destination in steady rain prior to its unloading. 3) Whether there was a quantum of damage and mitigation as the defendant was only 20% responsible for the damages sustained to the plaintiffs' possessions.  4) Whether liability was awarded in all the circumstances, even if the terms were not formed part of the contract, the defendant would not have been able to rely upon them in any event since they were not brought to the attention of the plaintiffs prior to executing the contract.  5) The Court assessed the current value of the property at $800,000."

He informed the court that some members of our Court have allowed this to be done, others have declined. In the court's respectful view, it is not appropriate for the Court to appoint, as selling officer, the solicitor for the applicant creditor. There are obvious difficulties with conflict of interest. Who does the selling officer serve: the Court, from which his or her authority originates; or the client? The matter is of sufficient importance that the court concluded it should reduce its thoughts to a fiat and direct that it be distributed to other members of the Court.

e_2016skpc157.txt,"HELD: The court found with respect to the following issues: 1) it would not permit the defence to argue the s. 8 violation at the conclusion of the trial because it had not mentioned it in its Charter notice. The Crown disclosed the video-taped interaction between the officer and the accused to the defence at the outset and it was clearly pertinent to the issue of reasonable suspicion, but the defence failed to raise it; and 2) there were two periods of delay and the court was satisfied that the 77 minutes between arrival at the station and the taking of the second sample was satisfactorily explained. However, the court found that first period of 35 minutes between the arrest to the time of departure was not satisfactorily explained. The officer did not act expeditiously and the delay may have prejudiced the accused because when, as here, the readings are slightly above the legal limit, the tests need to be taken as soon as practicable to ensure that the accused’s blood alcohol content at the time of driving is determined accurately. The Crown was not entitled to rely on the presumption in s. 259(1)(c) of the Code.","HELD: The accused was found guilty of driving while her ability to do so was impaired contrary to s. 255(1) and s. 253(1)(a) of the Criminal Code and having consumed alcohol in such a quantity that the concentration of alcohol in her blood exceeded.08 contrary to the s.255(1(1)). The breath tests were not taken as soon as practicable. The defence argued that the reasonable suspicion standard may be law, but it requires something more than mere hunch. The accused’s explanation for not being able to leave the scene till some 30 minutes after she arrested was not satisfactory and the defence should not be allowed to argue it at the conclusion of the trial. The court found that the 15 minute delay in obtaining the ASD from the police officer was unreasonable and prejudiced the accused. The delay may have prejudiced her. The need to take the tests as soonas practicable is to ensure that the accused's blood alcohol content was as accurate as possible at the time of driving. If a reasonable suspicion is raised, it is necessary to provide the Crown an evidentiary shortcut to proving impairment. In this case, there were two time periods that have to be considered: the time from arrest to departure to the police station, and the time between the arrival and departure at the station to the time the tests were taken. This delay was unreasonable. The Crown should not have relied on the presumption in s. 258(1), s.253(2), of the Code."
d_2004nssf15.txt,"The parties were married for 10 years. Contrary to the wording of their separation agreement, the husband argued that they had agreed that spousal support would only be payable for one year as the wife needed extra income from a secure source in order to obtain a mortgage on a new home.

Spousal support to continue at the rate set out in the separation agreement for a period of fifteen months from the date of the decision at which time all support shall terminate, unless, prior to the termination date, the wife commences an application which results in her showing cause why spousal support should continue; the husband has complied with his obligations with respect to the provision of an automobile. The wife's financial means and needs required support, the husband had made an agreement to provide such support and the evidence did not support a conclusion that it was agreed to be for only one year.

4_2013skqb207.txt,"The issue to be determined was whether the parties' children should remain in La Ronge or be relocated to live with the respondent in Melville on an interim basis. The parties were in a common law relationship and had two children, aged 9 and 12. After separation, the children resided with their mother, the respondent, in La Ronge and they had access with the petitioner on the weekends. In January 2011, the parties agreed to a weekly co-parenting arrangement. In April 2013 the petitioner was advised by the respondent that she and the children had moved to Melville. Up until that point the child had always resided in the La Ronge area and attended only one school.

The parties separated in April 2010 while living in La Ronge. The initial parenting arrangement was that the children resided with the petitioner and with the mother having access on weekends. The evidence discloses that the respondent sold her home and business in March 2013. The petitioner says that in April 2013 she asked the respondent if she was planning to move. The respondent advised that he would not be receiving the children for their scheduled parenting week because she had relocated to Melville. This arrangement was in place from January 2011 until April 2013 when the respondent unilaterally relocated the children from LaRonge, Saskatchewan back to Laville.

The child was apt to mistrust any information given to him about when he is returning, given past experience. 2) It is not necessarily the child who needs to be investigated, but the parents, these parents demonstrate little understanding of the effects of conflict on the child. The Child is merely reacting to the unpleasant behaviour of his two primary role models. Many problems would disappear if the entire family was devoted to one task. 3) The father was to have access for the weekend of August 16 to August 19, for the week of August 26 and for the same weekend. The mother had no say in the access arrangements. 4) The Court exercised the discretion given to it under The Queen’s Bench Act and directed that the parents complete the parental education program within sixty day. The parents were asked to explore the possibility of conducting future exchanges of the child through the supervised exchange program."
d_2017skqb42.txt,"HELD: The action was allowed. The defendants had defamed the plaintiff and he was entitled to damages in the amount of $100,000. The court found the following with respect to each issue: 1) it would substitute Postmedia as a defendant pursuant to Queen’s Bench rule 3-84(2) as it was the successor to Canwest and was aware of the plaintiff’s claim when it purchased the Star Phoenix and it would not be prejudiced. It would not deprive Postmedia of a defence under s. 5 of The Limitations Act because the articles remained on Postmedia’s websites and were republished whenever they were viewed or downloaded; 2) after reviewing each of the articles and assessing the words complained of, it found that the words constituted defamation; 3) all of the defendants were found to be joint tortfeasors with Purdy because they participated in the publication of a libel and were jointly and severally liable in defamation to the plaintiff; and 3) an appropriate award for general damages was $50,000. The court allowed the claim for aggravated damages as the defendants were found to be motivated by actual or express malice because Purdy did not simply report the jury’s verdict in her articles but indicated that she believed that the jury had not reached the proper verdict in the trial. She deliberately chose to report the stories of people who had made complaints about the surgical care provided to them by the plaintiff without verifying it or seeking comment from the plaintiff. As she was acting in the course of her employment, Purdy’s malice was attributed to all the defendants. The plaintiff was awarded $50,000 in aggravated damages.","HELD: The court found that the defendant was guilty of defamation as a result of a series of articles written by the plaintiff. The court believed that the articles were part of a wider defamation campaign and that the defendants, acting alone or in concert, had published defamatory comments about the plaintiff and her family. The defendants did not apologize or change their mind about the articles, and in fact, there was a voir dire warning that they were about to be published in newspapers across Canada. The plaintiff sued the defendants alleging defamation. The defendant was the successor to the original publisher of the Star Phoenix and was the current owner of that newspaper. In addition, the defendants were the current owners of the newspaper. As the plaintiff's claim was filed and the defendants' assets were purchased by the defendant, the defendant's statements of claim were frequently cited as to the accuracy of the plaintiff’s allegations. The defamation campaign was gaining media attention in Saskatchewan and the United States. In the fall of 1999, the plaintiff, who had recently been diagnosed with brain damage, filed a claim in Saskatchewan against the defendant in an action brought by her former employer. In a letter to the editor of another Star Phoenix newspaper, the doctor was asked by the court to allow the statement of claim to be amended to add the defendant as a defendant because the two-year limitation period set forth in The Limitations Act in force at the time of the alleged defamation had expired. The doctors had been practicing medicine in Dawson Creek and were aware of the existence of the Dr. Graham claim. They had not been disciplined or suspended from hospital privileges or pressured him to resign. The doctor had been performing tubal ligation on the plaintiff for many years and felt that since the publication of these articles, he was now entitled to an injunction requiring the defendants to remove certain content from websites under their control. In his statement of defence, the physician said that he had not suffered any actual prejudice as result of the articles and that he felt that the defamation campaign would continue into the future because he had been informed of the facts surrounding the case. The statement of claims was not amended until after the conclusion of the trial. The amended claim was not brought against the defendants as it was not based on any actual malice, malicious or recklessness of the defendants. The fact that the words complained of had nothing to do with the plaintiff but rather with the defendants’ intention to attack the plaintiff was enough to cause the defendants their concern. The claim was therefore dismissed."
e_2014skqb344.txt,"The court gave leave to counsel for the plaintiff to file an amended draft order nisi. It made the following recommendations regarding the draft order: 1) the sale should be held under the direction of a solicitor other than the plaintiff’s solicitor; 2) that relying upon a partial appraisal and in the absence of information on the condition of the property, setting the reserve bid at $100,000 might not reflect the best price. Fairness demanded the reserve bid be set at $125,000 but the court set the bid at $115,000. If the property could not be sold at that price, the plaintiff was given leave to apply to the court for a lower reserve bid; and 3) Queen’s Bench rule 10-47(2) required that purchase monies are to be paid into court to the credit of the cause to be applied as directed by the court, including costs. Only after an application and service upon the defendant and after the court had assessed solicitor client costs could monies be disbursed to the plaintiff. Monies owed under the mortgage must be set out by the court on application. All of these matters may be addressed in one final proceeding, in the application to confirm the sale, if the judicial sale proved successful.","The plaintiff applied for an order nisi for judicial sale of the property owned by the defendants. The Limitation of Civil Rights Act does not preclude the plaintiff from suing on the covenant because this is not a purchase-money mortgage. However, a judicial sale is required so that the plaintiff may apply to have the amount of deficiency set by the court. Otherwise, as provided by s. of the LCRA, foreclosure of the mortgage operates as full satisfaction of that debt. HELD: The application for the judicial sale was granted. The reserve bid was set at $100,000. There was uncertainty as to the proper manner of disposing of the land, especially since the proposed selling officer is not the plaintiff's own counsel. The court ordered certain rulings and directions be provided. There were also concerns regarding the use of a solicitor in a judicial sales application. The proposed sell officer ought not to be the plaintiff’s own counsel and the costs incurred by the plaintiff in this action on a solicitor and client basis are taxed. 1)Setting the reserve bid is an exercise of judicial discretion. The only information before the court as to what the value of the mortgaged land is is a partial appraisal. A partial appraisal does not mean that setting a reserve bid at $50,000 may not reflect the best possible price that can be attained. 2)Because some of the terms of the draft proposed order for judicial sales were matters that had been cautioned the plaintiff about on previous applications, it was appropriate that assess solicitor-client costs."

The creditor objected that the applicant had plenty of opportunity over the years to pay and drew attention to prior allegations of mismanagement or redirection of funds which should have been allocated to the payment of interest. HELD: The payment which should have been paid in November was to be paid within 7 days. The remaining payments set out in the schedule will commence January 2001 with the change in rate of interest from that provided under the Interest Act to one equivalent to pre-judgment interest.

HELD: The judgment was granted. The amount of the judgment recovered will be set aside and the judgment set out in the schedule will follow thereafter continuing with January 1, 2001. An officer of the applicant swore that the officers were prepared to infuse $100,000 into the company's treasury if need be to make up any shortfall from funds needed by the company to pay the instalmentments. In the absence of a formal commitment on their part to do so, the court cannot take that into consideration. The rate of interest to be paid on the judgment commencing with a payment to be made within 7 days will be equivalent to pre-judgment interest and should continue until the judgment is satisfied in full. This will replace the statutory rate ofinterest provided for under the Interest Act, R.S.C. 1985, c.

8_2014skqb299.txt,"HELD: The application was dismissed. The court held that the standard of review of the arbitrator’s decision was one of reasonableness. Section 25 of The Trade Union Act states that the conclusions of arbitrators are final and therefore the court noted they should not be interfered with lightly. Further, the court noted that the decision of the arbitrator was not of significant importance to the general public. The court reviewed the history of collective bargaining at the university and found that tenure was not dependent on the president’s personal recommendation in the past. The court found that the arbitrator’s reasoning was transparent and intelligible throughout. To include the word tenure in the definition of appointment or promotion was not the only conclusion that could be drawn. The arbitrator’s decision was within the range of acceptable conclusions and was reasonable.","The parties disagreed on the standard of review to be applied to the arbitrator's interpretation of s. 51 of the Act. The University's position was that the president's personal recommendation to the board was not required, and the Board was not obliged to follow his recommendation. The Arbitrator erred in misapplying the principles and tools of statutory interpretation in the awarding of tenure. HELD: The dispute was resolved in favour of the president and the board of governors. The parties agreed to a lengthy statement of facts and the admissibility of number of documents.  1) An award of tenure is neither an appointment nor promotion as contemplated by the Act nor is it a promotion within the meaning of the terms of the Agreement. The president must be taken to have acted through the tenure committee and the appeal committee and their actions are taken as his.  2) The interpretation by the Arbitrator was that an award on tenure was neither an appointed nor promotion under the Act, nor was it a appointment or promotion as considered by the Board. It was more reasonable to conclude that it was exercised within parameters set by the president in accordance with the Act and therefore within the Board's discretion. 3) Although the president may appoint a person to a permanent position on the academic staff of the University, the Board has not been bound by his recommendation as to tenure. The decision of the Board is final and there shall be no appeal within the University of Saskatchewan. 4) The legislature has, by default or design, chosen not to restrict the Board’s ability to set up the appropriate process and to award tenure itself. The court relied on the law from Dunsmuir v. New Brunswick, [2008] S.C.R. 190. 5) The parties’ position was based on the assumption that the President had the final say on whether a person should be given tenure, whether it was an appointment or a promotion, and whether the interpretation of sec. 51. 2. The latter was supported by the fact that the interpretation was consistent with those authorities discussed in the dissenting opinion."
9_2005skca89.txt,"This appeal arises from proceedings under The Family Property Act. The couple had lived together for several years. She sought judgment distributing their property. The property included a house in Vancouver, which he had acquired some years earlier with the financial assistance of his parents. The trial judge found that the respondent had acquired the house after the commencement of the spousal relationship and then went to hold that the petitioner was entitled to an equal share of its value with no reduction owing to the gifts or loans from his parents. The respondent appealed. HELD: Appeal allowed by the majority. Lane J.A. wrote in dissent. Majority: 1) The Vancouver property was acquired after commencement of the spousal relationship. The value of the property did not qualify for exemption under s. 23(1)(a) of the Act. There are a number of facts that merit emphasis. The respondent received $125,000 from his mother before the spousal relationship started. He still had that amount on hand when the relationship commenced. He used the money as a down payment on the purchase of the Vancouver house shortly after the relationship commenced. By establishing these facts, the respondent established the requisite conditions for the grant of an exemption of the value of the Vancouver property to the extent of the $125,000. 2) The trial judge erred in declining to take into account the loans of $100,000 the appellant received from each of his parents for the purpose of purchasing the Vancouver property. There was insufficient evidence before the trial judge to enable him to find that the mortgage debts were statute-barred and he did not make a firm finding on this point. The trial judge's finding that the respondent will not have to repay the loans was incomplete. He did not assess the loans in light of s. 21(3)(e) of the Act. On the whole of the circumstances concerning the Vancouver property and the length of the spousal relationship, there is no tenable basis for not giving effect to s. 21(3)(e) of the Act and the contributions made by the respondent's parents on his behalf to the acquisition of the property. The petitioner is entitled to share in the build up of the equity in consequence of the pay-down of the mortgage. Minority: 1) The Vancouver home ought to be distributed in accordance with s. 22 of the Act. The gift of $125,000 was made by the respondent's mother with the full knowledge that the parties were living together. In this case, the contribution by a third party on behalf of a spouse to the acquisition of family property is one of the usual factors outlined in s. 21 of the Act and it would be inequitable to exempt the gift from distribution. 2) The trial judge did not err in failing to deduct from the family property the loans given by the appellant's parents. He made a finding the loans were statute-barred. The trial judge clearly considered the legislation and his interpretation of the legislation was not challenged by the respondent. He also made the finding the loans would likely never be repaid. He simply used less than precise language.","This appeal stems from proceedings under The Family Property Act, initiated by Deborah Ruskin, a nurse, against Leith Dewar, a doctor. The two had lived together for several years. She sought judgment distributing their property or its value equally between them. The trial judge held that the parties had become'spouses' within the meaning of the Act in early June 1994 and that they had cohabited with one another continuously for two years. The latter lived in the condominium and was earning about $40,000 year. He owned the house at the time. It was appraised at $430,000. He bought it in October 1996. He paid $30,000 down and borrowed the remainder from the Hong Kong Shanghai Bank of Canada, granting it a mortgage on the house. The value of the house in Regina was exempt from distribution because it was acquired after the commencement of the spousal relationship. Alternatively, he contended the gift and loans served to reduce the value available for distribution. HELD: The appeal was allowed. Whether the trial judge erred in concluding the appellant, who acquired the Vancouver property in October 1994, acquired it after the commencing of spousa, or not before, is best considered in light of the material facts, the relevant provisions of s. 23(1)(a), and the distribution made by him. The respondent's position regarding the loans in favour of his parents came to rest on these provisions.  1) Whether he and Ms. Ruskin became spouses within the Act at the beginning of that relationship was governed by s. 22 rather than s. 21 and 23 of The Act. The significance of this case is that the fact as found is sufficient in law to render the relationship between the parties spousals effective as of late June 1994, as contemplated by the definition of'spouse' found in section 23 of the act. 2) Whether the judge cannot be said to have erred by concluding that the appellant had acquired the house after, not before the commences of the relationship, rather than before, the matter shifts to the second stage. Whether he erred on either of these issues is a more complex question and will serve to set the stage for their analysis.  3) The evidence is sufficiently supported by the evidence as to preclude interference on appeal."
4_2011skpc127.txt,"The Ministry brought an application for a permanent order for the child pursuant to s. 37 of The Child and Family Services Act. The Minister apprehended the child at birth. The mother's three older children had been apprehended with two other older children placed with a person of sufficient interest and the third child was made a permanent ward of the Ministry. The Minister argued that given the extensive past history of the three older children, the Minister properly apprehended the infant and the permanency planning committee was of the opinion that there was no use putting off the inevitable permanent order for the child. The mother and the child's father had separated with the father supporting the mother having the child returned to her care and the father having access to the child. HELD: There was no basis for the initial apprehension as the child was not in need of protection. The child shall be returned to the mother who is a person who has a right of custody of the child pursuant to s. 36(3) of the Child and Family Services Act. This shall be done on a transitional basis as determined by the Ministry with the child to be completely returned to the mother within 30 days of this order. There was no evidence presented at trial regarding attempts by the Ministry to pursue any less intrusive alternatives and instead proceeded directly to the most severe position being a permanent order. The evidence did not justify the Ministry's position.","The Ministry brings an application for a permanent order for the child, T.J.E.S., born April 19, 2010, pursuant to s. 37 of The Child and Family Services Act.

The burden is on the Ministry to establish its case on the balance of probabilities being the civil burden of proof. 2) The children have been placed into the temporary custody of the Minister, and the parents wish to have the children returned to them, they must make efforts to improve or remove the conditions or circumstances in the home which have resulted in the children being taken from the parents. 3) There have been ten witnesses at trial who have been confirmed as persons of sufficient interest. Two of these witnesses have been deceased. One of them is a child protection worker with the Ministry of Social Services. She was involved with the apprehension of a child not the subject of these proceedings. The other witness is a case management worker with Moose Jaw Transition House. She has conducted an eight week course on woman's anger expression. The course is based on conflict or choice theory and assists parents in setting goals and boundaries.

1993canlii3174.txt,"This was an appeal from a decision varying the appellant's maintenance downwards. The parties had a traditional marriage, with the wife remaining at home and caring for their three children. Upon separation, they entered into a settlement agreement whereby maintenance was set al. $2000 monthly while the appellant remained in the matrimonial home. The agreement stipulated that the settlement was a full and final settlement on all corollary matters between the parties. The respondent subsequently remarried, underwent some difficult financial times and made the application which was the subject of this appeal. The appellant contended the terms of the agreement were final. Per Jones, J.A. and Chipman, J.A. (concurring for separate reasons), allowing the appeal and setting aside the lower court order, that while courts have ultimate jurisdiction in the matter of support, settlement agreements must be respected. There is no difference between an agreement which provides for long term maintenance and one that does not contain such a provision. The effect is to permanently settle the issue in both cases. To review the agreement, particularly after the lapse of a substantial period of time, could lead to grave injustices to one or both parties. Per Hallett, J.A., (dissenting), dismissing the appeal, that a settlement agreement which provides for periodic support payments indefinitely is very different than one which contains provisions for termination of support after a specified period. The causal connection test established in Pelech v. Pelech (1987), 38 D.L.R. (4th) 641, should not apply to payors of periodic support for an indefinite period. Such agreements do not have the degree of finality that was effected by the settlement agreement under consideration in the Pelech decision.","The parties, who were married in 1961 and had three children of the marriage, separated in 1983. The husband, who had recently remarried, applied to vary the monthly maintenance payments made by the wife. There had been a dramatic change in the husband's financial circumstances, which required a reduction in the amount of maintenance. He sought to terminate the agreement in order to save money. The wife successfully applied for a termination of the support. Application to vary allowed; the trial judge's decision to vary based on the principles in Pelech did not apply here. There was no connection between the change in circumstances and the marriage; the evidence showed that substantial variations in the income of the husband in 1991 were not sufficient to support his continued income. The trial judge erred in not applying the causal connection test established in pelech; although the wife had accepted a lump sum payment, there was no ongoing requirement for periodic support from the husband; and there was a radical change in her financial circumstances which would justify a change in monthly maintenance."
c_2016skqb293.txt,"HELD: The appeal was granted on the basis of the first two grounds as well as others. The court quashed the tribunal’s decision and reinstated the appellant’s hospital privileges. The court reviewed the transcript of the tribunal’s hearing and its written decision. With regard to the first two issues, it found that the tribunal had erred in law in the following ways: 1) by failing to conduct a de novo hearing as required. It did not refer to the expert opinion submitted by the appellant as new evidence at the hearing; and 2) by failing to explain its decision. It did not refer to the new evidence nor did it state how it had reconciled the conflicting expert opinion evidence offered by the appellant and the respondent. It merely accepted the evidence of the SMO’s experts.",HELD: The appeal was granted. The decision of the Practitioner Staff Appeals Tribunal was reviewed and the errors that led to the granting of a remedy to the appellant were in accord with s. 45(3) of the Act. The Tribunal did not err in any respects and the appellant's position was accepted by the Tribunal as being in accordwith that of the Tribunal. There would be no reason for the Tribunal to have the same powers as a commission under the Public Inquiries Act if it was not a de novo proceeding.
2_2007skqb378.txt,"The outstanding issue is child support, past and future. The dispute largely centered on what monies were owed from the past. Central to this was the determination of the respondent's income. HELD: 1) The respondent is a farmer. His income tax returns for the years 2004, 2005 and 2006 have been filed, but certain adjustments must be made. The purpose of the capital cost allowance is to provide money to purchase replacement equipment. However, not all of the money is needed and is not used for that purpose. It is that unused portion which should be allocated as part of the respondent's income. In this case, 40% of the allowance should be treated as income for the purpose of calculating child support. The personal portion of the utility costs should be included as part of his income, an appropriate percentage is 25%. An amount of the legal and accounting costs should be attributed to the respondent personally and added to his income, in 2004 $1,000 is added, in 2005 $5,000 is added and in 2006 $1,000 is added. The respondent has taken advantage of the optional inventory adjustment and that must be factored back into his income using the methodology set out in Tamke v. Tamke, 2001 SKQB 528. As the respondent's income has undergone serious fluctuation over the years, it is therefore appropriate that his income for calculating child support be based on the average of his income in the years 2004 and 2005. 2) The respondent will not have to pay half of the cost of Stacey joining a school trip to Europe. This is because Stacey paid half of the cost herself and because the respondent was asked to contribute at the time but refused. The petitioner knew the respondent had refused to contribute and, when she elected to pay the balance, she did so unilaterally. It would be inappropriate to compel the respondent to contribute now. 3) The school fees paid by the petitioner are not extraordinary and should be encompassed in the basis child support. The health costs in the form of orthodontic treatments are extraordinary and the parties shall contribute equally as their incomes are presently comparable. 3) On five occasions the respondent failed to attend at the agreed meeting spot with the result that the petitioner had to make the entire trip to deliver the children to the respondent so he could exercise access. She will be compensated for the actual lost wages and fuel costs that she incurred on the respondent's behalf, but not for costs she would have incurred in any event.  4) The respondent shall pay costs of $1,200.","The parties have three children, all of which are now with the respondent. The oldest child, Mandey, is now with her mother. The parties separated in 2003 and the parties resided with their respective parents on alternate weeks. In 2004, the petitioner moved with the three children to Alberta. In 2005, the three youngest children moved back to the respondent, who paid no child support for them. Between 2005 and 2006, the parties had three children. Each child had its own residence. In 2006, one child moved back into the respondent's residence. This arrangement has continued to the present. Mandey now lives with the mother. HELD: 1) The capital cost allowance is to be paid for child support payable by the parties. 2) It is fair if the contributions are equal, taking into account that the incomes are comparable. 3) The respondent has claimed for a full day's wages. This ignores the fact that she would have been away from her employment for half the time in any event. This distortion is eliminated by joining it with the 2005 income. 4) The parties have 40% of the allowance should be treated as income for the purpose of calculating child support. 5) The petitioner should have paid $1,500 for chiropractic treatment administered to Stacey and $800 for orthodontist fees.

4_1996canlii5334.txt,"Following three patient suicides at the Cape Breton Regional Hospital, the hospital, in response to concerns and questions from family members, retained two psychiatrists to review the cases, the roles and responsibilities of individuals involved in the cases, patient records and hospital policies and practices. At the end of the review they were to provide a written report to the hospital's Chief Executive Officer. The hospital staff participating in the investigation and review were advised that their information would be treated as part of a 'peer review' and therefore confidential. Upon receipt of the report the hospital, as a result, refused to disclose the report to the families. An application pursuant to the Freedom of Information and Protection of Privacy Act was made by an M.L.A., who sought for the disclosure of the report and for a review of the hospital's decision to not release the report. The hospital decided to release the full report. The appellant employees appealed the decision of the hospital, claiming that they had been assured confidentiality. Allowing the appeal, that the disclosure of personal information consisting of personal recommendations or evaluations, character references, or personal evaluations by the appellants and other hospital staff are presumed under s. 20(3)(g) of the Act to be an unreasonable invasion of a third party's personal privacy. Under s. 20(1) the hospital is required to refuse to disclose this information. It necessarily follows that recommendations in the report founded upon such information is also presumed to be an unreasonable invasion of privacy and is likewise not to be disclosed. The remainder of the report is disclose able.","The appellant family sought to have a peer review of the circumstances of three individuals found dead, apparently at their own hand. The Regional Hospital refused to release the report, and instead held a hearing with the authors of a report prepared for the purpose of internal evaluation, education and improvement of hospital care and practices. The authors, being physicians with privileges at the Regional Hospital, were approached by the hospital staff to participate in the peer review. Doctor Jackson testified that he was initially told the report was to be confidential, but then received assurances it would be published. He testified that during the review process he was assured the report would be used as an internal document only, thus ensuring the confidentiality of his participation. He died shortly after receiving the report. The appellants appealed. Dismissing the appeal, that a hospital can only be an educational tool and, if the decision is made, it is a public body. Peer review is an educational process, and confidentiality should not be grounds for suspicion by family members or members of the public. In these circumstances, the appellants would be unlikely to take part in future peer review programs. In this sense, the report is a positive tool for the appellant family, and it is one that would be beneficial to them in the long run. However, if it is not, it will be harmful to the appellant community."

The trustee did not request costs and none will be awarded. 1) The applicant has demonstrated a sufficient basis for the order sought under the Rule 30 (1) under the BANKRUPTCY Act pursuant to s. 70(2) of that Act.  2) The proposal is developed based upon the trustee's due diligence in this regard and recommendations are made to the creditors concerning the viability of the proposal. To permit otherwise and endorse what the applicant has done would basically spell disaster for the efficacy of this proposal process. It would be virtually impossible for the trustee to make recommendations and for creditors to make reasoned decisions if the ranking of creditors' claims could change post filing date. 3) The registration of the security agreement by the applicant subsequent to the date the proposal was filed was contrary to the statutory stay provision as set out in s. 69(1)(a)of the BIA. It is undisputed that leave was not obtained for this purpose."
8_2017skqb53.txt,"The accused was charged with the commission of sexual assault, sexual touching in relation to a 16-year-old and possession of child pornography. The accused came to police attention via a report by the complainant. She reported that the accused was often viewing a pornographic website while in her presence. The police prepared an information to obtain a search warrant (ITO). The ITO stated that the search would provide evidence of the accused’s viewing of pornography in the presence of the complainant, bolstering the complainant’s credibility. The ITO did not reference possession of child pornography. The ITO sought only a search of the “search history on the computer”. The issued warrant authorized a search of the accused’s computer and related devices and media, as well as documents pertaining to occupancy of the home and control of computer equipment. The complainant subsequently alleged that the accused had taken photos of her in the shower. The police did not amend the ITO to include a search for photos. The police executed the search and seized, inter alia, a laptop, an iPhone and CDs. The police delivered the material to a computer forensic specialist at the RCMP and requested a complete forensic search of the computer and phone to obtain a general search of the Internet history, pictures of the complainant and messages between the complainant and the accused. The police knew that the search of pictures was not included on the search warrant. The RCMP did not review the terms of the warrant prior to completing the examination and examined the entire contents of the laptop and phone. The accused submitted that his s. 8 Charter rights had been violated by the search and applied for exclusion of evidence pursuant to s. 24(2). The application proceeded by voir dire. The evidence was apparently located on either the accused’s laptop or cell phone, but the nature of the evidence obtained was not disclosed at the voir dire. The following issues were raised: 1) What is the correct procedure to be used to challenge evidence seized pursuant to a search warrant; 2) Was the Crown able to call amplification evidence and have it considered in support of the search and seizure conducted; 3) Did the ITO set forth reasonable and probable grounds that the items sought were evidence with respect to the commission of an offence; 4) Did the ITO use boiler plate clauses; 5) Did the ITO establish reasonable and probable grounds that the items were likely to be found in the place to be searched; and 6) What was the extent of a search of a computer or computer device. | HELD: Evidence of the accused’s search history was validly obtained. Other evidence was beyond the scope of the search warrant and obtained by violation of the accused’s s. 8 rights. The court held: 1) There is a two-step inquiry to be made when real evidence is seized during a search. The first step is an inquiry into constitutionality, and the second is reached only after a constitutional infringement has been established. Both inquiries impose an onus on the person claiming infringement. The standard of proof is the balance of probabilities. Challenges to constitutionality of warranted searches may involve either or both a facial and a sub-facial attack on the authorizing warrant. The record examined on facial review is fixed: it is the ITO, not an amplified or enlarged record;  2) In attempting to enter evidence of the complainant’s allegation that the accused took pictures of her in the shower, the Crown relied on an argument that the ends justified the means. This amplification evidence sought to allege a whole new offence and area of search. It was not admitted; 3) The point of this voir dire was not to determine admissibility of evidence outside of the search warrant context. There was no requirement that evidence sought in support of allegations made be directly connected to a complainant or the actual subject matter of a complainant; 4) The ITO did not use impermissible boiler plate clauses when read in its entirety. However, it did not set forth reasonable and probable grounds that text messages were evidence with respect to the commission of an offence; 5) The ITO provided sufficient description. It was reasonable to infer that search history meant search history of the accused with respect to the websites defined in the ITO. Further argument was required on whether text messages could be included; and  6) Police are not entitled to rummage through entire contents of a device searching for other evidence. The ITO sought only the search history.","HELD: The application was allowed and the evidence taken on voir dire was to be included in the evidence at trial. The court found that the accused had failed to provide the complainant with sufficient evidence to support the charge that he had taken pictures of her while she was naked and showering and that he was in a position of trust or authority toward her for a sexual purpose, touching her directly or indirectly with a part of the body of a person under the age of 16 years and that there was a seven month gap between his discovering the pornography on the computer and the swearing of the ITO. The accused argued that this information was not included in his ITO because the software employed by the accused would automatically get everything on the device and then it was up to the forensic examiner to delve into the device in accordance with the search warrant or his instructions. There was also an issue concerning the amplification evidence, which the court found to be in breach of the accused’s s. 8 Charter rights."
e_1999skqb150.txt,"FIAT. It was held in an earlier fiat in June that the addition of the two proposed plaintiffs asserted new causes of action and amendments to the statement of claim could only be considered pursuant to an application under s.44(11) of the Queen's Bench Act. The defendant resisted the joinder of the new plaintiffs and amendments on the basis of undue delay and actual prejudice. The statement of claim alleged nuisance, and in the alternative, negligence against the City with respect to the design, construction and maintenance of the sewer system causing his basement to flood. The plaintiffs stated they only became aware of the damage to their home and possible health problems over period of time. Leave to appeal the June fiat was denied. The defendant plead limitation period defence to the amendment and argued that if the City had received notice of any ongoing problems it would have investigated and possibly taken steps to minimize any damage; that evidence had been lost; it may be too late to determine the causes. HELD: The amendments were allowed. 1)The limitation period in s.314(1) applies from the time damages were sustained, not from the date of the occurrence which led to the damage. The facts were uncertain. It was uncertain when the limitation period commenced. If the date the applicant should have discovered the additional damage was the date they received the geotechnical and structural engineering report, the amended claim was brought within the 1 year limitation period. 2)Inexcusable delay was not established. 3)It was not accepted that the defendant suffered actual prejudice. If it was prejudiced it was through its own inaction. No evidence had been lost. The basement was available for inspection. It had the benefit of the reports provided by the applicants. 4)The requirements of s.44(11) were met and judicial discretion was exercised to allow the amendments. The fact that the joint owner of the property was not included was due to inadvertence rather than any deliberate choice. It was also appropriate to join the new plaintiff. It appeared that the expanded claim alleged in the requested amendment was not apparent at the time the original claim was issued and arose out of the same occurrence. 4)Costs in the cause.","FIAT. The proposed plaintiffs applied to set aside proposed amendments to the original statement of claim and the joinder of parties to that claim. In the end, the Court held the amendments did not require leave to amend and found that the infant could be joined as plaintiff on the basis she was an infant against whom the limitation period of 1 year set out in The Urban Municipality Act had intervened. The limitation period for applications under s.44(11) of the Queen's Bench Act had not yet commenced to run. HELD: The application was allowed. The Court reviewed the requirements of s. 44(11). It considered it an appropriate exercise of judicial discretion to allow the amendments requested. 1)The infant was not included as a plaintiff at the time the original claim was issued, but rather as a party in the alternative negligence on the part of the defendant city with respect to the design, construction, and maintenance of its sanitary sewer system. 2)The amendments could only be considered pursuant to an application under the Queen’s Bench Act s.43(11), as amended.  3)The applicants met the requirements for s.40(11)(as a starting point. As there was no legal impediment to making the amendments, as there was not legal impediments to making amendments requested, it was an appropriate exercising of judicial discretionary discretion.  4)Gail Rousseau was a joint owner of the property and should have been included as an plaintiff when the original action was commenced. The fact that she was not appears to have arisen from inadvertence rather than any deliberate choice made at time. Her joinder as a person in this situation is contemplated by the Rules (Rule 38(1)) and normally would not be contested."
e_1996canlii6831.txt,"The petitioner sought a divorce, custody, spousal and child support and an unequal division of matrimonial property. The respondent counter-petitioned for similar relief, including divorce, joint custody and an equal division of the property. HELD: 1)Sole custody was awarded to the mother with access on the same terms as contained in the interim order. Two reasons for not awarding joint custody were the obvious acrimony between the parties and the respondent's reluctance to support his children. Three weeks after his application for sale of the home was rejected, he applied for a leave of absence from his job. It was inferred that he was trying to avoid complying with the order for interim support. 2)The mother re-entered the workforce after many years' absence. She suffered an economic disadvantage from the marriage and its breakdown. 3)The car owned by the petitioner when she married was exempt property. The motorcycle was disregarded as there had not been a significant increase in value. The list prepared by the respondent was used to divide household goods, tools and equipment. 4)The respondent was to assume one-half of the bank loan and it was agreed that the pension funds should be shared equally. 5)It would be unfair and inequitable to the custodial parent to order an equal division of the matrimonial property. The petitioner was granted possession of the matrimonial home until the younger child's 18th birthday or until she vacated the property. 6)The respondent cannot avoid his responsibility of providing an adequate level of support by turning his back on well-paid employment. Spousal and child support were deducted from his share of the matrimonial home. The petitioner was given leave to return to Court after February 28, 1999 for reconsideration of child support.","The petitioner sought a divorce, custody of the children, spousal and child support and an unequal division of matrimonial property. The respondent counter-petitioned for similar relief, including adivorce, joint custody, custody with the children and an equal division of Matrimonial Property. HELD: 1)The respondent was granted exclusive possession of the matrimonial home and interim custody. He was ordered to pay monthly spousals of $1,400. 2)There was considerable divergence in appraisals of motor vehicles which made it unlikely that a prospective purchaser would buy a vehicle without knowing its mechanical condition. Apart from one or two small items, his living expenses disclosed in her financial statement appeared reasonable. The petitioner was advised to take leave of absence from her employment to pursue a new career. She was to arrange to have her home sold and the proceeds divided among the spouses.  3)The petitioner was given leave to return to this Court so that she may make an order for interim support.  4)The parties had a traditional marriage. The husband was a civil servant. He owned a truck and trailer. It was not uncommon for him to rent the home when he was transferred to Regina. The parties lived in the home until September 1995, when it was sold to a friend of the husband. He rented the home for six months and then moved back to work full-time. He did not appear entitled to any support during this time. He must organize his situation in such a manner that he can keep up his obligation to his children."
e_2016skpc106.txt,"HELD: The accused was found not guilty. The court found that the accused’s s. 8 Charter rights were breached. Pursuant to a Grant analysis, the court excluded the evidence obtained after the illegal entry of the accused’s home. The court found that the accused had not consented to the entry by the officer and the complainant and it was therefore a warrantless search. The officer did not have the lawful authority to enter the home on the basis of arresting the father as he was not in hot pursuit. The complainant had not obtained a warrant under s. 13.1 of The Child and Family Services Act to enter the accused’s home and therefore had no lawful authority to enter the home. There were no exigent circumstances to justify the search such as preventing the destruction of evidence as they already established that the person they sought was not in the house. The unlawful entry and search of the accused’s home was a severe breach of the accused’s Charter rights. The impact upon her was severe as the complainant gathered evidence and apprehended her children. The accused’s assault on the complainant was minor in nature and although not excusable, her offence was a reaction to a significant breach of her rights. The administration of justice was served by excluding the evidence.","The accused was charged with assault contrary to s. 266 of the Criminal Code and breach of probation by failing to keep the peace and good behaviour. The complainant was child protection worker employed by the Ministry of Social Services. She enlisted the assistance of Moose Jaw Police to enter the accused's apartment to investigate whether the children were in need of protection and if necessary to apprehend those children. The accused was released on conditions of bail that included that he was to have no contact with the complainant. She was not in hot pursuit of an individual, and had not seen the accused at all that day. The argument between the parties was escalating and the complainant and the officer both believed that the accused had contact with Ms. Bigsky and that she wanted the accused charged. The defence argued that the evidence obtained following the unlawful entry did not alter that situation. The issue was whether the accused actually had the legal authority to enter Ms.'s apartment suite and to apprehend the accused. HELD: The Court held that the officer did not have the lawful authority to allow them in. The fact that the worker had directed him not to have any contact with her does not alter the situation. There was no evidence that the father had any authority under s. 13.1 of the Child and Family Services Act or that he had any other legal authority. The evidence was excluded from the evidence."
e_2009nssm47.txt,"The claimants live on property abutting the defendant Burrow's property. The defendant Renouf is Burrows' friend. As favour, Renouf attended the property while Burrows was away and cut down some trees that he was asked to cut. He went on to cut down several others that he felt were diseased/damaged. eventually realizing he had crossed the property line and cut down more than 17 of the claimants' trees. The claimants sued for the cost of replacing the trees with a comparable number of mature trees, the cost of removing the felled trees and to recoup for anticipated damage to their septic field. At issue was: 1. whether Renouf trespassed; 2. whether Burrows was liable for Renouf's actions (for 'hiring' Renouf or because they were engaged in a joint enterprise); and 3. damages. The claimants did not want Burrows helping with the tree removal, even if doing so would save money. 1. Renouf trespassed on the claimants' land and is liable for damages. That it was an honest mistake is irrelevant since trespass does not require bad faith or improper purpose. 2. Burrows is not liable. He was not Renouf's employer, nor were Renouf's actions foreseeable. It was a favour and Renouf went way beyond the scope of what he was asked to do. Burrows is not responsible for everything that flowed from their limited enterprise. The case law requires a degree of blameworthiness (a neglectful or unlawful enterprise) which creates a foreseeable risk of harm. 3. Renouf to pay the claimants: $3,750 to replace the trees with young, native trees (half the amount sought by the claimants), $2,000 for tree removal (half the quote submitted by the claimants since they refused to mitigate the damage by allowing Burrows to help). While Burrows had counterclaimed for damages arising from a confrontation between the claimants and his son, he did not seriously pursue it and it was dismissed. Costs of $1,234 awarded to the claimants (including $960.77 for disbursements). While the amount seems high, the case was large one and the counterclaim, although not seriously pursued, hung over the claimants' heads as they prepared for trial.","The plaintiffs were awarded costs of the action against the defendant, who was a friend of the plaintiffs. The defendant had cut down trees on the plaintiffs' property, claiming to be doing a favour for them. The plaintiffs sued the defendant for tree removal, claiming negligence by the defendant. Dismissing the claim, that the defendant was not a paid employee of the plaintiff, but rather was involved in a joint enterprise with the benefit of the other parties. The plaintiff was not seeking to be associated with the defendant's enterprise. The court found the defendant to be liable for the felling of the trees, given his familiarity with the plaintiff's land and his willingness to cooperate with him as he worked on the case. The counterclaim was dismissed. There was no evidence that the defendants had any idea that the plaintiff would be interested in cutting the trees."
e_2002skpc80.txt,"The accused was charged with owning a dog that without provocation attacked a person contrary to the Urban Municipality Act s.135.3(3). There were four separate incidents involving the dog in September 2001. At issue was whether the Crown had proven an attack on any of the four occasions. The accused agreed that the presumption of non-provocation set out in s.135.2(1) of the UMA applied and that presumption had not been displaced. HELD: 1)A $200 fine was imposed along with conditions. The dog must be kept within an enclosed continuous fence and chained to a post. There must be a gate preventing exiting except while on a leash and muzzled. The owner must display a sign stating Guard Dog on Duty. 2)If dog is territorial or protective, and the facts show the human has, by intruding, been in law provocative, the offence may not be proven beyond reasonable doubt. On the evidence there was no intrusion sufficient to justify an attack or which could be considered provocation. 3)There were seven specific pieces of evidence which supported the conclusion that the owner did not take reasonable steps to ensure his dog did not attack someone in the fashion prohibited by s.135.3(3). It is irrelevant at law that after dog attacks it responds to its owner's commands. The dog escaped the yard, was off leash and was not sufficiently restrained or enclosed. logging chain affixed to post is substantial way of tethering dog. One would not expect dog to be attached to logging chain if there were no concerns.","The accused was charged with assault contrary to s. 135.3(3) of the Urban Municipalities Act. The evidence indicated that the accused's dog ran through the front of his house and then into the alleyway where it upset the complainant's daughter. At issue was whether the Crown had proven an attack on the accused. HELD: The accused was found guilty of four separate incidents involving the dog. The court found that the proximity of the animal and the actions of the dog to the complainant made it clear that the dog's action was an attack. The appropriate fine was $200. On the definition of attack, the definition is not appropriate and is not accurate in the context of an attack by an animal. If a dog runs toward or up to a person, that makes clear that it's not a provocation. The accused took reasonable steps to prevent the offence from occurring. On all of the incidents the accused had demonstrated, beyond a reasonable doubt, that the animal had the potential to inflict serious injury."
b_2010nssc387.txt,"The small claims adjudicator granted an order for substituted service after the respondent had trouble serving the appellant with notice of her claim. As per the order, she personally served the appellant's mother and notified the appellant of the hearing date by text message. He didn't appear and default judgement was granted against the appellant in the amount of $11,031.35. The appellant appealed, arguing the adjudicator failed to follow the natural requirements of justice. He denied being in contact with his mother. He admitted receiving the text message(s) but said he didn't believe the respondent, but didn't make any further inquiries. New evidence (a letter from his mother saying she was not in contact with her son) was allowed on the appeal. Appeal dismissed. The right to be heard is a fundamental right, and an appeal of a default judgment must be subject to the highest scrutiny. Here the respondent's claim was valid. The adjudicator had the jurisdiction/authority to make an order for substituted service and the respondent followed it. At the very least, the appellant was notified of the hearing dates by text message(s). While he may not have believed the messages, he should have taken some steps to confirm with the court if there was indeed a hearing set. He failed to prove he had a reasonable excuse for defaulting, chose to ignore the notice, and was mistaken only as to what would be the outcome if he failed to appear.","The respondent appeals a decision of the Adjudicator of the Small Claims Court. The respondent appeals that decision by Notice of Appeal (form 9) dated June 16th, 2010 and within the 30 day appeal period. The singular ground of appeal cited in the appellant's Notice is a failure to follow the requirements of natural justice. The appellant's claim that he did not know the hearing took place and, when he failed to show up, Judgment was awarded against him. Personal service was effected upon him by the Order for Substituted Service granted by the Small Claim Court in accordance with the provisions of the Act and regulations of the small claims court. This means the Respondent did everything that she was directed to do by the small claim court and the Court did what it was authorized to do under the Regulations. Service having been properly effected on the respondent, the Court was not prepared to interfere with this finding of the self-proclaimed 'godfather of the South' (the appellant's mother). HELD: The appeal is dismissed with costs of $139.35 to the respondent. 1)It is a breach of the requirements for natural justice not to have a mechanism in Small Claims court whereby, if a defendant does not file a defence or appear at a hearing by mistake but can show that he has an arguable defence that should be heard on its merits, and he has a reasonable excuse for defaulting and is not just stalling, (emphasis added) the judgment cannot be set aside. In light of the increase in the monetary jurisdiction of the court, it is as relevant to nature justice in the Small claims court as it is in the Supreme Court. There is still a requirement that the applicant show sufficient bases for the court to exercise discretion to avoid abuse. 2)There was no reasonable excuse as found in Kemp, supra, for his failure to receive notice of the hearing date and for his choice to ignore it. The error was made in not making any effort to contact his mother prior to the hearing, which was at the same time that personal service was being effected on him."
e_2012nssc101.txt,"The accused was charged with sexual assault and various other sexual offences with respect to his niece (who had spent weekends and summers with her father, who lived with his sister and the accused) when she was between the ages of 12 to 15. The accused denied the allegations, suggesting that, since the niece had not disclosed any of these matters until she was 17 years old, she had made up generalized allegation against him to stop her boyfriend from breaking up with her and then found it necessary to maintain the lie, tell her friends, her mother and the police and get more specific when pressed for details. He also argued that she was not credible because her testimony in court was inconsistent with that in the preliminary inquiry and although there were numerous persons she could have confided in at the time, she never told anybody about the alleged incidents but kept going back to visit her father. Accused found guilty of all counts. Although she was at times frustrated and unable to recall precisely, the niece's demeanour was consistent with a young person doing her best to be truthful and accurate in intimidating and embarrassing circumstances. Her evidence was both consistent with that of other witnesses and internally consistent and the inconsistencies with her previous statements were minor. The court found she had no motive to lie initially or during her trial testimony and the reality was that by making these allegations, she knew her father would be forced to move and would become estranged from his sister, her family would be fractured and the 'sister'-like relationship she had with the accused's daughter would end.","The accused was charged with four counts of sexual assault. The Crown alleged that the accused touched the victim with his hands and, while he was in a common-law relationship with the complainant, he also invited the victim to his home and touched directly a part of her body, including her penis, contrary to s. 152 of the Criminal Code and, for the first time, suggested that the victim had motive to lie or mislead the court. The Court found that the Crown had not established that the complainant was the biological father of the child. Therefore, the Crown could not prove that the allegation was credible. Further, the court found that, to a ground conviction, the accused must prove beyond a reasonable doubt that he committed any of the offences committed. The essential elements of the sexual assault were comprehensively addressed by the Supreme Court of Canada in v. Ewanchuk 1999 CanLII 711 (SCC), [1999] 1 S.C. 330. In relation to the four counts on the Indictment, the Court held that witness' credibility was mixture of reliability, reliability, integrity and impartiality. The accused had been in common-laws relationships with both the complainant and the respondent; the Crown was able to rely on the testimony of the complainant; the accused's ability to originally observe the event, to record it in memory and recall it; the passage of time since the event in question was factor in this regard."

Although at one time the child had been in the permanent care of the Agency, that order was terminated and replaced by a private guardianship order which had placed the child with the now-adoptive parents. Although neither of the birth parents, who resided in British Columbia, had attended the adoption hearing, the birth mother now sought access to the child and requested that the court receive fresh evidence as to her unsuccessful efforts to obtain counsel to represent her at the adoption hearing. Appeal allowed; adoption order set aside; matter remitted to the application court for a further hearing; application to admit fresh evidence granted in part; the portions of the appellant's affidavit addressing her efforts to secure counsel for the adoption hearing admitted into evidence. The appellant had a bona fide intention to appear or to be represented at the hearing and had made reasonable, although unsuccessful, efforts to do so. Allowing the appeal would be in the child's best interests as she had resided with the adoptive parents for the past three years and would continue to do so pending the further hearing.","The appellant was the birth mother of a child born in 2002. The child was residing with her birth parents at the time of their temporary guardianship order in Alberta. In 2005, an order for permanent guardianship was granted. Upon first learning of the welfare authorities involvement with the child in 2005, the respondent parents temporarily relocated to Calgary and put themselves forward as potential adoptive parents. In late March 2007, the appellant was notified that her application to adopt had been granted. The order contained a provision that access by the birth parents was left to the respondents. The respondent parents were each personally served with a Notice of the Adoption Hearing scheduled to take place in May 2007. Neither appeared at the hearing. The consequent delay need not impact the child. The appellant was not seeking to oppose the adoption but wished to be heard."

The caveat purported to be based upon a right to receive royalties from all gas, carbon and oil produced from the land. The applicant denied having ever received the notice to lapse. The applicant sought: 1) retroactive reinstatement of the caveat by order of the Court; and 2) an inquiry by the Court as to whether or not the caveat was removed improperly. The respondent companies that acquired an interest in the subject land subsequent to the caveat being removed opposed the application based, among other things, on the principle of indefeasibility of title, as did the Registrar of Land Titles. HELD: The application is dismissed with costs to the respondents. 1) Even if the caveat was removed improperly, the Court ought not to retroactively reinstate it, because to do so would defeat the fundamental principle of indefeasibility of title that has been continued in The Land Titles Act, 2000; and 2) it would not be appropriate to permit the applicants to attempt to access the assurance fund through the mechanism of a chambers application requesting declaratory relief.

The court found that even if the caveat was wrongfully removed by the Registrar of Land Titles and that the caveat be reinstated retroactively, it would defeat the fundamental principle of indefeasibility of title that has been continued in The Land Title Act, 2000. The respondents were entitled to costs. 1)Even if the caveats were wrongfully Removed by the Land Titling Registrar, the court ought not retroactively reinstate the caveat. To do so would defeat this fundamental principle, which has been the 'curtain principle' of the Torrens system. 2)It would simply not be appropriate to permit the applicants to attempt to access the assurance fund through the mechanism of a chambers application requesting declaratory relief. The process, if the applicants choose to pursue it, would be an action under Part XII of The Land Tittles Act,2000. 3)The principle of'indefeasible' of title was not materially altered by the passage of the 2000 Land Tittle Act. The principle was retained by the new legislation. The exception, reservations and interests that are implied pursuant to s. 18 to 20 of the Land Tiltles Act are registered against the title.

d_2005skqb454.txt,"The plaintiff sues the defendants for $50,000 plus interest. The claim is based on the allegation that the plaintiff loaned the defendant Kelly $69,000. The plaintiff claims the defendants agreed to repay the loan in the amount of $1,500 per month. HELD: The plaintiff's claim is dismissed. The only evidence that might suggest that this transaction was a loan to either of the defendants was that some of the payments made by the defendant to the plaintiff were in the amount of $1,500, the amount that the plaintiff asserts was the monthly amount to be repaid by the defendant for the loan. However, there was no evidence as to when the agreement to pay $1,500 was made. In her testimony, the plaintiff stated that when the decision was made to pay the $69,000 to the business, she did not have a discussion with the defendant, Kelly. The only discussion she seems to have had was with her husband after which she wrote a cheque to the defendant.","The plaintiff sought damages in the amount of $50,000 plus interest in accordance with the provisions of The Pre-judgment Interest Act. The plaintiff loaned $69,000 to the defendant and her husband in 2001. The defendant denied the loan was a loan, and argued that in fact it was an investment by the plaintiff and husband into the auto brokering business. HELD: The claim was moot as there was no evidence of a loan to either defendant and/or the numbered company defendant evidencing the nature of the transaction. The evidence showed that the plaintiff advanced the money in her sole name at a branch of TD Canada Trust in addition to the money from her father's estate and that the defendant helped her register a motor dealer with Saskatchewan Justice.

At the hearing, the accused argued that the Attorney General had not disclosed all the evidence in his custody or control and that he was entitled to disclosure only of materials relied upon by the requesting state to establish its prima facie case. HELD: The motion for a stay of proceedings was granted and the hearing was to proceed. Counsel for the accused was instructed to make full and prompt disclosure.  1)It is not the business of an extradition judge to assume responsibility for reviewing the actions of foreign officials in preparing the evidence for an extradition hearing. The fundamental issue is the extent of the accused's right to disclosure of documents and information. If he is not entitled under sec. of the Charter to what he has requested then concurrent common law rights cannot serve to expand his entitlement. 2)The accused's application for detailed disclosure was under the Charter and no consideration was given to parallel common-law rights advanced by the accused in the Daul case specifically, denial of natural justice.  3)Although the role of the hearing judge is a modest one, absent express statutory or treaty authorization, the sole purpose of a extradition hearing is to ensure that the evidence establishes a prima-facie case that the act alleged would constitute a crime in Canada.  4)The Act does not provide an expanded Charter jurisdiction. The Act provides that the Minister and the extradition judge occupy two (2) different solitudes. The Minister has a role at the beginning and the end of the extradition process. The judge discharges his or her function in the middle. Each operates independently of the other except to the extent that neither exercises jurisdiction nor reviews the other's determination or decision."
c_2001skqb39.txt,"The defendants brought an application to compel responses to a large number of questions objected to at examinations for discovery of the proper officer for SPMC, and sought an order requiring SPMC to comply with numerous undertakings. The objections were categorized as the questions sought to elicit the plaintiff's manner of investigation or expert opinions; it should have been asked of another witness better suited to answer or third parties as the questions relate to issues between the defendant and the third parties; it was irrelevant or improper. HELD: 1)The plaintiffs were not required to answer questions which would require them to accept or reject an opinion of another party to the action. 2)The plaintiffs should answer what cellulose fibre insulation was present at the time of the fire. 3)The affidavit answered whether Miner was a participant in the investigation notwithstanding the defendants are not entitled to the names of possible expert witnesses at the discovery stage. 4)Any meeting between the plaintiff's investigators and the fire marshal clearly related to its investigation and is privileged. The defendants could obtain the information directly from the fire marshal. 5)The question of whether there was any liaison between the city fire investigator and SIAST was improper as it relates to the manner of investigation. Questions can be asked of the city. 6)Details of the plaintiff's investigation, including an engineer's report, was protected by litigation privilege. 7)The question regarding what observations were made of the damage was too vague. The plaintiff's claim was in excess of $7 million. A proper foundation must be laid in the context of specific questions and answers given or not given (Hill v. Arcola School Division). The defendants are not entitled to expert opinion. 8)Whether SPMC's insurer's investigation team participated related to manner of investigation and was therefore privileged. 9)The defendant will be able to examine the city in the third party claim with respect to documents from the fire department. 10)All discussions at mediation proceedings are strictly confidential. The name of the plaintiff's expert, who prepared the drawings in contemplation of litigation, is privileged. 11)The facts and observations upon which expert opinions are based must be disclosed including any photographs.  12)Whether any pattern on the wood would indicate contact by propane flame required expert opinion. 13)Questions concerning what material first ignited could only be answered by having experts reconstruct what in their opinion occurred at the time the fire started. 14)If the plaintiffs do not have a position (on whether there was a fire stop in the 1967 construction of the tower), there is no rule the court is aware of requiring them to adopt a position. They can be required to give an undertaking to provide a position if they adopt one at a later date. Whether they believed the building was built in accordance with the 1960 fire code when constructed in 1967 was information obtainable by the defendants. 15)If the party being examined had no control over or greater access to a witness than the examining party, it need only disclose the evidence known to it. There is no obligation to seek information from third parties when the defendants are capable of obtaining that information. 16)An undertaking was given to advise if and when the plaintiffs develop a position on whether the parapet roof was constructed in accordance with the detail set out in FC and whether the detail in the sketch of the Tower parapet was correct. 17)If the request for the proposal related to Kelsey, the document should be produced, but if it only related to the Regina campus, the document was not relevant. 18)Whether it was considered anytime that Hagblom would be a sub-consultant was a legal question. The trial judge will interpret the terms of the agreement. 19)Any information required could be obtained directly from the architects who had been added as third parties by the defendants.  20)The plaintiffs gave undertakings to answer the other questions and did not object to answering them. 21)The 36 objections (less 3 that were withdrawn) failed. It would be an abuse of process for the defendants to ask the same question of a second officer hoping to obtain a different answer. The same question can be put if the first did not answer it. The fact there were three separate officers does not restrict the defendants to only asking certain questions of each. The reason for having three officers, each with a different expertise in a certain area, was to prevent the plaintiffs from having to give endless undertakings. Having all three present during each examination would have saved time and unnecessary legal fees. 22)The exhibit was not before the court to determine how complicated the question was. Defence counsel was to break it down. 23)There were 200 undertakings. As a general rule examinations for discovery should be completed before the party being examined is required to comply with the undertakings. It would lead to endless delay if the examining party were allowed to simply adjourn and demand the undertakings be complied with. There were no exceptional circumstances.  24)Costs were left to the trial judge.","The defendants applied to compel responses to a large number of questions that were objected to at examinations for discovery of proper officers on behalf of Saskatchewan Property Management Corporation (SPMC). They sought an order requiring SPMC to comply with numerous undertakings. The plaintiffs had issued a statement of claim for damages in excess of $7,000,000. The question asked was what portion of the wall had been covered by a fire stop? The answer was 'the northeast corner of the Tower.' These names do not reveal anything of the facts in issue that the respondent did not already have but reveal details of the appellant's investigation of the fact in issue. That is exactly the sort of information that litigation privilege is designed to protect. Objection No. 6-P. 297, Line 26 to P. 300, Line 1) The question was asked what observations were made of the damage post fire, the damage to the roof and its... and the attic that would connect the point of breakout to the point where Hagblom were operating or were working. The only thing that could be said was that names of possible expert witnesses were not discoverable. The Court was asked to know whether the plaintiffs had any position on the issue. HELD: The questions were asked in a proper foundation. There must be some reasonable degree of specificity to a question of this nature when reference is made to document. The plaintiff was not required to answer the questions asked. The court found that the respondents were entitled to the names of expert witnesses who had been retained by the defendants and that information was privileged. The respondents were not entitled to ask for the plaintiffs' expert opinion on a burn pattern. As the respondent conceded that the drawings were privileged, the plaintiffs were not required or required to provide that information. They were only required to supply the facts contained in the investigator's reports, the information obtained from each witness and the information of the plaintiff's expert who prepared the drawings in contemplation of litigation. The judge will eventually interpret the terms of the agreement. The applicants refused to answer questions asked of the SPMC expert. The purpose of the order was to obtain the facts, the factual observations of the witnesses and to provide the plaintiffs with information that the plaintiffs would be compelled to hand over. The requirement that the questions must be questions of the party's position in law are not proper. To rule otherwise would be to penalize the party who first investigated the plaintiff. The Act does not require the respondents to supply all parts of the reports and statements which deal with facts relevant to the issue"
c_2012skqb426.txt,"The Crown applied under Part XXIV of the Criminal Code to have the accused declared a dangerous offender after he pled guilty to committing an aggravated assault on his common-law spouse contrary to s. 268 of the Code. The application is based on the Code provisions in effect before the danger offender legislation set forth in The Tackling Violent Crime Act was passed. The accused is 52 years old and in poor health. He has a significant criminal record thatreveals a history of violence and an inability to abide by court orders. The offences occurred between the time he was 40 and ended in 2006 with his last conviction, the predicate offence. Two psychologists prepared psychological assessments both of which concluded that the offender should not be declared a dangerous offender because his risk to re-offend could be reasonably managed by supervision in the community. The issues before the Court were: 1) whether the predicate offence is a serious personal injury offence as defined by s. 752 of the Code; 2) whether the offender is a threat of the kind contemplated by s. 753 of the Code and thus a danger to society; 3) if so, whether the Court should exercise its residual discretion an impose a fixed-term sentence or resort to long-term offender provisions, even though the statutory criteria for declaring the accused a dangerous offender have been met; and if a long-term offender designation is warranted, what determinate sentence and long-term supervision order should be imposed? HELD: 1) The Court held that the aggravated assault committed by the offender was a serious personal injury offence because it was an indictable offence involving the use of violence against his spouse. 2) The Court found that the Crown had proven the criteria required that the offender clearly fits within the definition set forth in ss. 753(1)(a)(i) and (ii), in that this offender had shown a repetitive and persistent pattern of aggressive behavior, especially against women. 3) The Court decided to exercise its residual discretion not to designate the offender as a dangerous offender and found that the he met the long-term offender criteria and that his risk to re-offend could be managed within the meaning of s. 753.1(1)(c). The offender has never been imprisoned in a penitentiary and thus had never had the benefit of programming offered in that system. The appropriate sentence should be 7 years. As the offender has spent approximately 3 years and 4 months in pre-sentence custody, the Court gave him credit in that amount on a one-to-one basis. The Court ordered that the appropriate length of time for a long term supervision order is the maximum of 10 years since the offender needs to learn alternative ways to express his frustration and address his issues with alcohol.","HELD: The Court found that the offender was a 52-year-old man with a significant criminal record who should be declared a dangerous offender. The Crown applied under Part XXIV of the Criminal Code to have him declared a 'dangerous offender'. The offender was convicted of aggravated assault contrary to s.268 of the Code. The offender is 52-years-old and has a single, dated conviction. He was charged with common assault on his wife contrary to S. 266 of the code. The Court was also impressed with the offender's willingness and ability to work with others, especially women, despite his lengthy criminal record. The court found that both the offender and long-term offender were at high risk to re-offend violently in the future, and that their risk to do so was high."
b_2010skqb187.txt,"The plaintiff granted the defendant a mortgage over a parcel of land just outside the city limits. The defendant failed to make any payment. The plaintiff applied for foreclosure on the land and an order nisi for judicial sale. The defendant was a developer. He argued that the foreclosure action was void because the land was being used as farmland and was subject to protection under s. 9 and 11 of The Saskatchewan Farm Land Security Act. The other issues before the court were the appropriate period of redemption and whether the plaintiff could submit a bid that incorporated the value of the land as a 'credit' enabling the plaintiff to merely 'top up' the bid by the additional amount needed to reach the bid price. HELD: The Saskatchewan Farm Land Security Act (SFSA) did not apply. The undisputed evidence was that since the defendant acquired the land in 2007, their focus was to develop the land as an industrial park and they had undertaken a host of activities to achieve that purpose which clearly indicated that their intent was not to farm the land in the sense contemplated by the SFSA. There was no foundation to deviate from the usual redemption period of 90 days from the date of the decision. The bidding process in a judicial sale contemplates a level playing field for all participants. The fact that the plaintiff is likely to receive a significant cash payout from the judicial sale does not modify the desirability of obliging all bidders to pay into court the full bid price. Normal bidding rules shall apply. The plaintiff was entitled to costs.","HELD: The application was dismissed and the usual bidding rules applied. The plaintiff was not owed an amount on the mortgage and that it would likely receive a significant cash payout on sale. There was no evidence that the defendant, Alberta Ltd., or any of the defendants entered into a proposed lease on the land which could reasonably bring it within the statutory purpose of the SFSA as considered in Christie v. Texas Industries and in particular Part II. The Christie case had no application as it was decided within the scope of the 1984-85-86 FLSA, now repealed. Alberta Ltd.'s focus and direction vis-à-vis the land was the undertaking of a host of activities designed to develop the land into an industrial park. The defendant, based on its proposed use of the land, was not a farmer but rather a development site."
2_2005skqb513.txt,"FIAT: The parties are the parents of a son born April 10, 2003. They are married and the family home is in Connecticut. The respondent mother is a Canadian citizen and has returned to Canada and now resides in Laird, Saskatchewan. The petitioner is an American citizen and continues to reside in Connecticut and brings an application under The International Child Abduction Act for an order directing the child to be returned to Connecticut. HELD: The respondent is directed to return the child to the State of Connecticut by January 8, 2006.  1) The child was born in Canada. He and his mother joined his father in Connecticut one month later in May 2003. In February 2004 the child and his mother returned to Canada for a planned one-month visit. It is clear that the petitioner did not consent to the prolonged absence of the respondent and the child. In about November 2004 the respondent and the child returned to Connecticut and resumed living with the petitioner. Reconciliation was attempted. The respondent and child left in December 2004 and have not returned. The crystallizing moment was in March 2004 when the respondent did not return from her trip to Canada. For the purposes of the Convention, circumstances should be examined to determine habitual residence. At this point the parties had adopted traditional roles. The respondent was at home raising the child and the petitioner was attending his duties in the navy. Through their conduct the parties had evidenced a settled intention to make their home in Connecticut. The respondent chose to unilaterally remove the child from that home. 2) The petitioner had obtained an interim order in February 2005 directing the child to be returned to Connecticut. He also pursued his case in the Superior Court in Connecticut and on October 2005 obtained an order dissolving the marriage, directing the respondent to return the child to Connecticut and granted the petitioner sole custody. The respondent now asks that any order directing her and the child to return should be conditional on the petitioner varying the order he obtained in October 2005, vacating the award of sole custody to the petitioner and replacing it with something in the nature of joint custody. The conditional return order proposed by the respondent is inappropriate. Having determined that an order for return is warranted under the Convention, it does not lie with a Saskatchewan Court to impose a revised starting point for the process of determining custody in Connecticut. This Court's role concludes upon the determination the petitioner has made out a case for an order for return.","FIAT: The parties are the parents of a child born April 10, 2003. They were married and the family home was in Connecticut. The respondent mother, Canadian citizen, continues to reside in Saskatchewan. The petitioner father brings an application under The International Child Abduction Act for an order directing the child to be returned to Connecticut. HELD: 1) The case law is at odds as to whether reference should be had to the domestic statute when addressing the issue of habitual residency under the Convention. It is an open question whether the return was to address the pending custody application or to attempt reconciliation. In any event, reconciliation was attempted. The child's habitual residence is now in the State of Connecticut. 2) The petitioner obtained an interim order in February 2004 which directed the respondent to return to Connecticut and granted the petitioner sole custody. In the meantime, the parties' relationship has been strained and the child has not returned to the petitioner. The parties' situation with regard to habitual residence has been concluded. The debate over whether the respondent should return to Canada is moot as conclude the statutory definition of habitual residence under the Children's Law Act, 1997 is not in conflict with the case law developed under the convention. Rather than engage in lengthy debate with the Central Authority in Saskatchewan, the Court was compelled to take the necessary steps to secure the prompt return of the child."

The Court of Appeal had ordered the Crown to produce an itemized inventory of the information in its possession to enable the Queen's Bench to review the information the Crown should disclose to the defence. This fiat concerned several documents. The Crown had already disclosed the contents of each of these documents and the only matter remaining in issue was the name of the lawyer who released the information. This arose as a result of the action of a Regina lawyer who had improperly revealed information from two of his divorce clients with respect to the charges against LaPorte et al. The Crown quite properly disclosed these statements which had been conveyed to the investigating officer.

3_2001nssc117.txt,"The plaintiffs were Sergeants in the Town of Bedford Police Department. Following amalgamation and before any collective agreement was concluded, the Chief of the amalgamated force issued a department order declaring that all persons in the position of the plaintiffs would be referred to as a level two Sergeant which created a two-tier structure within the Sergeant rank. The bargaining agent for the union declined to process a grievance on behalf of the plaintiffs and agreed with the two-tiered structure which was eventually incorporated into the collective agreement. After unsuccessfully complaining to the Nova Scotia Police Commission and the Halifax Regional Board of Police Commissioners, the plaintiffs commenced an action alleging that the creation of the two-tiered structure was a violation of the Police Act and adversely affected their employment rights. The intervenor union brought an application to strike the plaintiffs' proceeding on the basis that the court lacked jurisdiction to hear the matter. Application granted; proceeding stayed pending submission to arbitration or any other form of proceeding that is permitted under the statutory enactments applicable; if no application is made to lift the stay within two years, the action will stand dismissed. Where there is a threshold question of whether the dispute is arbitrable, that decision should initially be made, absent very limited exceptions, by an arbitrator and not by the court. It is irrelevant if the plaintiffs have now lost their rights to initiate the arbitration process.","The Halifax Regional Municipality Act, effective April 1, 1996, provided for the amalgamation of the municipal police forces into the HRM. The plaintiffs were part of a Bargaining Unit represented by the MAPP. The plaintiff police officers, other than Tim Mosher, were originally employed as police officers by the Bedford Police Department. In 1994, the merger between the police force and MAPP was made illegal. They were not employees of HRM at the time. They became part of the bargaining unit represented by MAPP in 1997. In 1999, the Board of Police Commissioners dismissed the plaintiff's application for collective agreement arbitration. They held that arbitration would be appropriate where there was a dispute over the meaning of the Police Act and Regulations. In this case, the police officers were not union members but were subject to the collective agreement's terms and conditions of employment. MAPP and the defendants argued that s. 41 and 42 of the Trade Union Act do not apply because the cause of action pre-dates the union agreement. They argued that under the current collective bargaining regime, which included increases in the rank of corporal and decreases in rank, it is possible to speak of individual contracts of employment and to treat the collective agreements as mere appendages of individual relationships. Dismissing the application, that in the circumstances, the collective bargaining agreement represented an exclusive mechanism for resolving disputes between the parties. The essential character of the dispute arises out of the legislation, rather than the bargaining agreement. This is especially so when it is considered whether there is an effective remedy. HELD: The decision of the Nova Scotia Court of Appeal in Nova Scotia Union of Public Employees v. Halifax Regional School Board is informative as to the appropriate approach to be taken when there is a threshold question of whether the question is itself arbitrable. 1) There is no exclusive jurisdiction, as there was in the earlier stages of the negotiations between the plaintiff and the Commission. The Commission declined to consider the matter on the basis it had no jurisdiction to convene an investigation or inquiry since there was no evidence any demotion was the result of a disciplinary default. 2) The parties did not contemplate demotions except under proceedings taking place under the terms of the previous collective agreement. The exclusivity of the grievance/arbitration process does not exist for police officers. 3) The Commission did not object to the plaintiff making a demotion to a rank of Sergeant. 4) The exclusive jurisdiction model is expressly contemplated by s. 35 and s. 45 of the Act. 5) There are"

Quite apart from certification and voluntary recognition, the union could attain bargaining rights pursuant to Part II of the Trade Union Act, which allowed an employer in the construction industry to assign bargaining and negotiating rights to an 'accredited employers' association' such as the Construction Management Labour Bureau Ltd.

(2) the respondent misinterpreted a point of law and gave rise to the review of the decision by the court.

The father applied to vary child support in November on the basis of his reduced income. HELD: The application was dismissed with costs to the petitioner fixed at $1,000. The onus is on the applicant to provide cogent, independent or objective verification of change of circumstances. This application was brought 10 months after the pre-trial conference. It was of no consequence that someone may come into the home rather than using commercial day care service. There was no change in the father's hours of work or the schedule. The only change was that the mother was no longer available to provide care during Saturday of his access weekends. The mother was not to schedule activities during the father's access periods without his consent and he was to provide 7 days written notice if he chooses not to exercise access during specified times. This was not a variation of the custody/access regime but rather specific directions to provide some predictability for the children.","The parties applied to vary the child support provisions of the consent judgment, including his contribution to child care expenses and access provisions. The respondent's income was reduced from $43,386.34 to $42,386., and his proportionate share of child care costs was $226.00 per month. The petitioner sought to have the access portion varied so as to provide for access every Saturday evening. HELD: The application was dismissed with costs to the petitioner fixed at $1,000. 1)Once a change in circumstances becomes a material issue, the method of support must be revisited in such a manner as to make it reasonable to the children. This application was brought just ten months after the pre-trial conference. The material did not satisfy the Court there had been any material change in the respondent's circumstances. Once a material change becomes a matter of fact, the application becomes inappropriate. 2)Once the matter becomes a question of material change, the appropriate method is to apply for variation of the access provision. Once the question becomes of whether there has been any change in material circumstances the child is no longer able to afford the same support that was provided. Once this becomes a fact the child becomes unable to afford to provide support at the same amount as before. Once that becomes a subject matter the child's ability to provide that support becomes an issue of fact. 3)Once again the material issue becomes of what substance the child has provided to the court the child will be unable to provide the same level of support that is provided to him. Once again the matter of whether the matter has been revisited becomes an inappropriate one. Once it becomes a factual issue the child shall be able to provide cogent, and where possible, independent or objective verification of the change in his circumstances."

The plaintiff claims she told the Town Office to shut off her water supply and the failure to do so let to the damages being sustained. HELD: The claim is dismissed. 1) There is no evidence that the plaintiff gave clear instructions to the town to shut off her water. 2) The proximate cause of the damage was turning off the heat and power without ensuring that water line, toilets, and the water tank had been properly drained. 3) The plaintiff sustained no damages herself. She admits she negotiated the sale price of $50,000 with her daughter prior to any damage being sustained to the property. No adjustment had to be made to her daughter thereafter for any 'loss' occasioned. Any claim would have to be made by her daughter not her.","The plaintiff brought an action for water damage sustained to her former residence when frozen pipes burst. She alleged that she instructed the Town of Martensville to shut off her water supply and the failure to do so led to the damages being sustained. The defendant contested such instructions and, in any event, the cause of the pipes bursting was not as a result of the water not being turned off, but because the plaintiff had the power and heat disconnected. HELD: The plaintiff's action was dismissed. There was no order as to costs. 1)The defendant was correctly identified as the plaintiff's daughter. She did not request the water be disconnected and accordingly no signature was required or obtained on the back of the form. The form executed by the plaintiff clearly indicated request for final billing. This cannot be construed as negligence in the circumstances by the town nor does the fact that specific forms are now used for disconnect purposes elevate the matter on the facts before the Court, to negligence by the Town, to which negligence is to be condoned. 2)The Court cannot find on the evidence that clear instructions were given to the plaintiff to disconnect the water service. To the contrary, the form executed executed by her clearly indicated requested final billing in the ordinary course. This could not be construed either as negligence or negligence in that specific form are now utilized for disconnecting purposes. This however could be construed at best between what the plaintiff believed she was requesting and what in fact she did instruct. 3)The daughter's action could not succeed because of a misunderstanding at best. The daughter's signature was not required. Neither did the signature on the BACK of the FORM. 4)Discussions about the damage to the property were not discussed. The water was not properly attended to. The plaintiff failed to bring any claim for long-term damage or the inconvenience to her neighbours."

After the plea was entered, the accused and another accused entered into a plea agreement to an assault caused bodily harm which was to be determined by the Crown. The victim, who had been living with the accused for three months prior to the assault, suffered lacerations to his face, head and upper body and suffered contusions to his arm and arm. He underwent a successful completion of an alcohol and drug addiction program and was working with a significant other. The accused and the victim had a tumultuous relationship and were involved in a number of disputes. The impact of the assault on the victim and the accused was aggravating. The court imposed a fine of $1,500 plus a probation order with strict conditions. The defendant filed a lengthy written victim impact statement with the court which was not totally consistent with the version of the facts and injuries suffered by the victim. HELD: The court found that the accused had a significant criminal record and the fact that the assault took place at his residence did not directly or indirectly impact the victim's ability to participate in the harm management or rehabilitation efforts undertaken by the accused. Taking into account both the aggravating and mitigating factors, the court found a sentence of 18 months to 2 years less 1 day, less a day imprisonment, and a suspended sentence with conditions, or alternatively a conditional sentence of three years probation with conditions."

The respondent states that he has paid child support pursuant to the court order of February 2000 but, when the children reached the age of majority, he reduced the amount of child support payable as the children became independent and moved out on their own. The petitioner takes issue with the respondent's unilateral reduction in child support and submits the children remained children within the meaning of the Divorce Act so long as they were attending university. The parties agree that given the age of the children there has been a change in circumstance sufficient to allow a review of the existing child support order. HELD: 1) The parties agree that Jill, age 26 is no longer a child of the marriage and that Luke, age 21 is not presently a child of the marriage but could once again become a child of the marriage if he attends university in the fall of 2008. The parties also agree Keegan is 18 and remains a child of the marriage by virtue of the fact that he is taking classes at the university. 2) While the respondent asks that he be allowed to pay child support directly to the children, there is nothing in the material filed which would indicate that the petitioner is not providing support to the child in an appropriate fashion. Further, the difficulties that would arise in respect to enforcement of the order if the child support payments were not made directly to the petitioner would mitigate against such a variation.","FIAT: The respondent filed an application for an order varying child support orders. HELD: 1) The parties agree that given the age of the children and the change in the amount of support for the respondent in the meaning of the Divorce Act, that there has been a change in circumstances sufficient to allow a review of the existing child support order. The order sought to be varied is based upon the respondent's declaration that the children are no longer children of the marriage within the meaning OF the Diva Act and his obligation to pay proportional amount of post-secondary expenses for the child of the relationship, Keegan, is no longer a child within that meaning.  2) The guideline amount payable by the respondent is $380 per month plus 33% of s. expenses. 3) In the interim, any such payments made shall be applied firstly towards the ongoing child support for Keegan and then towards the arrears. 4) It is well-settled that full time attendance in a post -secondary education program may result in a child over the ageof majority qualifying as 'child' within the Meaning of the Act. Jill, now 26 years old and on her own and for the parties' two children, Luke and Keegan, age 6 and 9 months respectively. Luke and Keegan are now 21 and 21 years of age and could once again become a child if he attends university as he intends. There is no order as to costs as success has been divided."
9_2006skca114.txt,"This is an application for leave to appeal, and leave being granted, an appeal by the Crown from a sentence imposed against a young offender pursuant to the Youth Criminal Justice Act. The respondent pled guilty to a charge of robbery, an offence contrary to s. 344(b) of the Criminal Code. The respondent was sentenced to 90 days secure custody, 45 days community supervision, 1 year probation and a 10 year firearms prohibition. HELD: Appeal allowed orally. The sentence is set aside and a sentence of 12 months closed custody, 6 months community supervision, 1 year probation and a 10 year firearms prohibition was imposed in addition to the 90 days closed custody already served at the time of the appeal.  1) It was clear that the primary concern of the sentencing judge was that, in the wake of the Supreme Court of Canada decision in R. v. B.W.P.; R. v. B.V.N. 2006 SCC 27, a custodial sentence might not be open to him at all. It is the Court's view that the sentencing judge's conclusion that the decision in B.W.P. virtually ruled out custodial sentences for young persons under the Youth Criminal Justice Act was unwarranted. The gist of that decision is that under the Act the principle of general deterrence is not a factor to be taken into account and cannot be used to justify a sentence harsher than the circumstances of the offender and the offence would warrant. Nor is specific deterrence to be considered as a separate factor. 2) It is the Court's view that a long custodial sentence is necessary to accomplish the task of bringing the seriousness of the offence to the respondent's attention, and provide meaningful consequences to reinforce societal values without negatively affecting the respondent's likelihood of rehabilitation.","This was an application for leave to appeal and, leave being granted, an appeal by the Crown from a sentence imposed against a young offender pursuant to the Youth Criminal Justice Act, S.C. 2002, c. 1. The respondent pled guilty to a charge of robbery, an offence contrary to s. 344(b) of the Criminal Code. The inescapable conclusion was that the sentence imposed by the sentencing judge was demonstrably unfit, failing to take into account the seriousness of the offence, the culpability of the respondent, the criminal history and other circumstances of the offender, and the principles of sentencing set out in the Act."
8_2001skca55.txt,"The Crown sought leave to appeal a conditional sentence of 9 months of time served plus 2 years less 1 day, including 3 months on electronic monitoring, and 2 years probation with a 10 year firearm prohibition on each charge to be served concurrently. The sentence was imposed for robbery with threats of violence contrary to s.348(1)(b) and s.334(2) of the Criminal Code which were committed in March 2000 while the accused was on probation. The appellant and co-accused were convicted of breaking and entering a private residence. The accused took $25 from the premises and held the 68 year old victim while the co-accused went to look for a knife after threatening to cut off his fingers. The following day the two accused used threats of violence while robbing a pharmacy and a witness testified the accused yelled to the co-accused to kill the victims. The co-accused who was convicted of assault received 7 years in prison for the robbery concurrent with 5 years for the B &amp; E. The 23 year old aboriginal who had a Grade 3 education had a prior record of 42 criminal convictions including eight violent or weapons related offences. HELD: Leave was granted. The appeal was allowed. The sentence of 4 years in prison on each charge to be served concurrently took into account time served on remand and electronic monitoring. The sentence was demonstrably unfit and fell outside the range of sentences previously imposed. The sentencing judge relied solely on the principle of rehabilitation, essentially ignoring the other sentencing principles including the level of gravity, the principle of deterrence, the need to denounce such acts, the sentence imposed on the co-accused, and the need to protect the public. A sentencing circle was inappropriate given the level of violence, his risk to re-offend, his consistent ignoring or refusal to follow court orders, and the fact that a penitentiary term was called for in such circumstances. He had violated various forms of community release orders including bail and probation 16 times. He had a history of drug and alcohol abuse and had not attended treatment.","The Crown sought leave to appeal the sentence imposed on the respondent after a sentencing circle. The respondent plead guilty to committing the offences of robbery and robbery with threats of violence contrary to s.348(1)(b) and 334(2) of the Criminal Code, and was sentenced to nine months time served, plus two years less one day conditional, including three months on electronic monitoring, plus three months probation with a ten year firearms prohibition on each charge to be served concurrently. The Crown appealed the sentence. HELD: The appeal was allowed. The sentence imposed was demonstrably unfit and falls outside the range of sentences previously imposed by this Court. The public must be protected from this type of criminal behaviour and more severe sentences are called for. The sentencing circle was inappropriate in these circumstances given the level of violence, the respondent's high risk to reoffend, his consistent ignoring of or refusing to follow court orders and the fact a penitentiary term was called for, and the appeal allowed."
4_2005skqb279.txt,"The plaintiff claims damages for injuries sustained when he was punched in the face and knocked unconscious by the defendant. Liability is admitted. The plaintiff applies for summary judgment pursuant to Rule 485 of the Queen's Bench Rules. The parties agree that damages should be assessed on the basis of the affidavit evidence. HELD: 1) The defendant pled guilty to a charge of assault causing bodily harm. He was sentenced to a fine of $1,500, placed on probation for 18 months and ordered to make restitution to the plaintiff for the cost of the dental work in the amount of $3,263.30. 2) The plaintiff suffered serious injuries and significant pain for a number of months after the assault. Extensive dental treatment was required and will be required at some point in the future. The plaintiff has minimal scarring. He is awarded general damages of $12,500. 3) The pleadings and the affidavit evidence do not support a substantial award for aggravated damages. However, the photographs graphically depict the extent to which his appearance was altered. Hurt feelings can reasonably be inferred from the fact that the plaintiff was rendered unconscious on the ground in a crowd of onlookers. These circumstances justify an award of aggravated damages in the sum of $2,000. 4) The plaintiff was awarded special damages in the amount of $1,911.70.","The plaintiff was standing with other patrons near the entrance to a pub when the defendant punched him in the face and knocked him unconscious. The plaintiff applied for summary judgment and an assessment of damages pursuant to Rule 485. Liability was admitted and the plaintiff now applied for a summary judgment of damages in the amount of $5,000.00. HELD: The plaintiff was awarded general damages of $12,500.00, $1,911.70 plus costs and pre-judgment interest.  1) The court reviewed Queen's Bench Rule 153 (which requires a party to plead specifically any matter, fact or point of law which, if not specifically pleaded, might take the other party by surprise. 2) There were no special damages proven by the plaintiff and no aggravated damages can be awarded because the plaintiff did not expressly plead them in his statement of claim.  3) The plaintiff suffered significant pain and suffering for a number of months after the assault. Extensive dental treatment was required and further treatment will be required in the future. Excluding any component for aggravated damages, the court concluded a fair award for general damages is $12500."
6_2000skqb94.txt,"A jury determined the plaintiff was constructively dismissed from his employment as park superintendent in 1997 and awarded damages for failure to give reasonable notice. The defendant claimed the contract of employment was all inclusive; that the plaintiff exaggerated the amount of time he spent on the job in winter; that the reduced winter hours were not in lieu of overtime pay as he was a manager within the meaning of s.4(2) of the LSA; the doctrine of estoppel or waiver applied as he never claimed a right to holiday pay for 10 years and the employer relied on his not doing so; if the plaintiff is entitled to holiday pay he should only recover back to April 1990 as he is limited by the Limitation of Actions Act; it should not be based on wages plus truck allowance as wages as defined in the LSA does not include allowances for costs. The claim for unpaid holiday pay claimed from April 1988 to October 1997, based on his wages plus one-half his truck expense allowance, was reserved pending a decision by the Court of Appeal as to whether the Court of Queen's Bench has jurisdiction to determine the issue of entitlement to holiday pay. HELD: The claim was dismissed with costs.  1)The Court of Appeal held in Kolodziejski v. Auto Electric Service that the Queens' Bench has jurisdiction to entertain a civil action for non-payment of holiday pay. 2)The plaintiff may rely on s.30(1) of the LSA to establish he is entitled to holidays and on s.33 to establish he entitled to pay in lieu of taking holidays. The onus then shifts to the defendant to prove it complied with some exception in the LSA. Section 75 prevents an employee from waiving his or her entitlement. Whether the plaintiff asserted his right to holiday pay or not, he remained entitled to his annual holidays in accordance with the LSA. 3)The plaintiff can claim for any holiday pay in lieu of time off that he can establish he was entitled to from April 1990 to his termination date. Section 3(1)(f)of the LAA states that a cause of action for recovery of money under a contract, express or implied, must be commenced within 6 years of the date on which the cause arose. 4)The plaintiff clearly indicated that a portion of the truck allowance was made to avoid paying tax. As such it would be contrary to public policy for the Court to appear to endorse the plaintiff's actions by calculating his holiday pay on the basis of his wage and this portion of his truck allowance.  5)The defendant's position that the contract included a component of holiday pay each month was inconsistent with its position that the plaintiff took these days off as holidays during the year. The contract of employment did not include a component of holiday pay in lieu of time off.  6)Failure by the defendant to keep records for the purpose of inspection by the minister does not result in a reverse onus. The onus remains on the plaintiff to establish what holidays he did not take. 7)The plaintiff admitted to taking time away from his duties for personal time and for city business as mayor. The plaintiff was not there in his capacity as superintendent. Section 31(1)(b) indicates that an employee shall be permitted to take holidays in one uninterrupted period. The defendant allowed the plaintiff to take days off in any manner he chose. It was inconsistent that the plaintiff's failure to comply with the notice requirement meant for the benefit of the employer could be used by an employee to disclaim that his days off were holidays. 8)The plaintiff was clearly a manager within the meaning of LSA. Even if he were not a manager, he failed to prove, on a balance of probabilities that he worked overtime hours in excess of the statutory minimum in order to qualify for overtime. Any days off taken by the plaintiff could not be considered taken in lieu of overtime. The days he was away were holidays as defined in s.30 of the LSA. 9)He did not establish he did 3 weeks holidays.","The plaintiff sued for damages from the defendant alleging he was constructively wrongfully dismissed from his employment with the defendant. The plaintiff elected to have the determination of liability and the assessment of damages determined by a civil jury. The jury determined that the plaintiff was constructally dismissed and awarded the plaintiff damages. In addition to the claim for damages for failure to give reasonable notice of termination, the plaintiff asserted a claim against the defendant for unpaid holiday pay that he alleged was owing to him at the date of his dismissal. The defendant argued that holiday pay should be calculated on the basis of his wage, his benefits and the amount of his truck allowance. HELD: The plaintiff was awarded his holiday pay in lieu of time off. Any holiday pay owing to the plaintiff will be calculated only on the plaintiff's wage. The onus to rebut the presumption of entitlement in accordance with some exception set out in the LSA. The next preliminary issue is the period for which the plaintiff may make such a claim for holiday pay. The court reviewed the various alleged breaches of the holiday pay entitlement and found that the defendant had not complied with some of the provisions in the Act. The issues to be dealt with are whether the plaintiff is entitled to holiday pay, if the plaintiff has been constructively dismissed, the defendant's claim for holidays and the damages awarded by the jury in relation to this claim, and if so, if any holiday pay is awarded to the defendant in the future. Regarding holiday pay the plaintiff can rely on s. 33 of the Labour Standards Act, which states holiday pay must be equal to or greater than his wage and benefits. The argument that the truck allowance should not be included in any computation of holiday pay was not supported by the evidence in Kolodziejski v. Auto Electric Service Ltd. (1999), 177 Sask. R. 197."
b_1995canlii6024.txt,"The accuseds were charged under ss.300 and 301 of the Code with (i)committing and (ii)publishing a defamatory libel against a police officer. They filed a plea of justification as permitted under s.611(1) of the Code. The Crown denied the truth of the plea pursuant to s.611(4) and the matter proceeded to trial. At the opening of their trial the accuseds applied for an order declaring ss.300 and 301 of the Criminal Code to be of no force and effect on the basis that they constituted an unreasonable limitation on their rights and freedoms guaranteed under ss.2, 7 and 11 of the Charter. The Crown admitted that ss.300 and 301 limited an individual's right to freedom of expression as provided by s.2 of the Charter but argued that this infringement was justified under s.1 of the Charter. HELD: Application allowed in part.  1)The onus of justifying the limitation of a right or freedom is on the party seeking to uphold the limitation and the standard of proof is by a preponderance of probability. 2)The standards against which a limit on a right or freedom guaranteed by the Charter can be shown to be reasonable and demonstrably justified are those underlying values and principles essential to a free and democratic society. While the right of free speech is important in our society, it is not unrestricted. 3)In order to justify an infringement of this right, it must be shown that: (i)the impugned legislative provision has an objective of pressing and substantial concern and (ii)there is a proportionality to the legislation in that: (a)the measures must be fair and not arbitrary, carefully designed to achieve the objective in question and rationally connected to the objective; (b)the means should impair freedom of expression as little as possible; (c)there must be a proportionality between the effects of the limiting legislation and the objective. S.300 of the Code meets these tests, and is therefore a reasonable limit on free speech and is valid. 4)Ss.611 and 612 of the Code, which permit a plea of justification do not create a reverse onus on the accused. They are procedural and merely serve to put the Crown on notice as to the accused's defence. The Crown must still prove that the alleged defamatory libel is knowingly false beyond a reasonable doubt. 5)S.301 of the Code makes it an offence to publish a defamatory libel whether or not the accused believes it to be true. S.301 is therefore not a reasonable limit and is invalid. ADDENDUM: The Court ordered that the agreed statement of facts set out at pp. 2 and 3 of the judgment not be published nor broadcast in any manner.","The accused applied for a declaration that s.300 of the Criminal Code constitutes an unreasonable limitation of one or more of the rights and freedoms guaranteed by s.2(c) and s. Charter. HELD: 1)The accused were found guilty of libel. The accused were accompanied by a number of other persons. 2)There was no violation of s.11(c)(b) of the Charter. The threshold test for the application of s303 was met. 3)The Court must consider all expression potentially restricted by s300. The objective of the criminal code is to protect persons from the harm caused by false and defamatory attacks or the reputations of members of society. 4)S.300 is a reasonable limit in free and democratic society. The Court must not be diverted by the offensive content of the particular speech giving rise to the Charter challenge. 5)Section 298, 299 and 300 of the Code constitute a limit prescribed by law within s.of the Charter which is not arbitrary, unfair or based on irrational considerations. 6)The test for s.adequality was met in favour of the accused. 7)The Actus reus elements of the s300 offence are mere illustrations of the various factors which either alone or provably contribute to the limitation on freedom of expression. 8)Section 309 and 311 are very broad. Counsel for the applicants submits that a broad range of relatively trivial or innocuous material would fall within those provisions. 9)An accused need only raise a reasonable doubt for an acquittal under s. 300."
b_1991canlii4497.txt,"A large diseased elm tree fell on a truck and injured the plaintiff driver. For some years prior to the accident, the defendant had operated a hazardous tree removal program. An inspector had examined the tree that fell. The inspector had no expertise relating to trees or their diseases, nor did his immediate superior. For the plaintiff, that there is a prima fade duty of care owed by the Department of Transportation to users of highway against reasonably foreseeable hazards, including the falling of trees onto the highway. Further, the defendant had a duty to use a reasonable standard of care in the operation of the hazardous tree removal program. The defendant was negligent in failing to train the inspector properly. The Court referred at length to the Supreme Court of Canada decision in Just v. British Columbia. The defendant's claim against the third parties (owners/occupiers of property on which tree stood) was dismissed.","The plaintiff was injured when a tree fell on him while he was driving on a public highway. The plaintiff's action against the defendants was discontinued. This defendant had joined the plaintiff's third party efforts to remove trees from the roadway. The cause of the decline was determined to be basal infection and rot by the fungus Ganoderma applanatum found on the stump of a tree. The defendant had originally framed in nuisance and negligence a separate action in which the plaintiff was the third party. The actions of the defendants were consolidated and joined together. The plaintiffs' action against each defendant was discontinued as a result of the Attorney General's discontinuation of the defendant's action. The defendants were seeking contribution and/or indemnity from the plaintiff. The Court found that although the defendant had an 'expert' in tree pathology, it did not have to be a specialist to determine the extent of the disease in order to determine whether the defendant was exempt from liability."
d_2009skqb70.txt,"At issue is the amount of Income Replacement Benefits (IRB) payable to the appellant by SGI. The parties agree that the calculation of the IRB as provided by s. 117 of the Act is the annualized sum of $28,889.75. The appellant takes issue with SGI's reduction of the amount determined in accordance with s. 117 of the Act by calculating the appellant's net income in accordance with s. 135 to s. 138 of the Act. HELD: SGI has correctly calculated the appellant's IRB when it made the requisite deductions as set out in s. 137 to find the appellant's net income, and then reduced the net income to 90% to determine his IRB. It would be neither a rational nor fair interpretation to reduce a full-time earner's IRB by 90% and not the other types of earners. It would be neither a rational nor fair interpretation to deduct income tax, employment insurance premiums and Canada Pension contributions from only full-time earners. All earners are subject to these payments being deducted from their income but for their inability to earn an income because of an automobile accident. The further deductions to obtain the non- earner's IRB are in keeping with his earning reality.","The respondent was paying $28,889.75 per month for the 181st and subsequent days following an accident as per s. 117 of the Automobile Accident Insurance Act. The respondent argued the IRB should not be less than that of the respondent's IRB calculated for the first 180 days after the accident. The hearing judge held that SGI had erred in holding that the income replacement benefit payable during the post 180 day period pursuant to s.117(1) and (3) of the Act is not to be less then the income substitute benefit payable for the post180 day period. HELD: 1) SGI has correctly calculated the respondent’s IRB when it made the requisite deductions as set out in s. 137 and then reduced the net income to 90%. Counsel for Montgrand also appealed SGI”s calculation of interest on monies owed to the respondent on the basis of pre-judgment interest. 2) The phrase “subject to the other provisions of this Division” as meaning “governed by” or “affected by’ the other provision of this division is in keeping with the purpose of the legislation. It strives for one's earning reality. Non-earner in the past may well become someone whose employment income, but for the accident, would be more than the weighted average approach used by SGI. If a non-earning, such as Montgrand, has proved on a balance of probabilities that the promised employment reflects his earning reality, a poor past record ought not to preclude the claimant from an IRB that reflects his earned reality. Therefore, Montgrand has the benefit provided by s. 116(1)."
4_2004nsfc6.txt,"The Agency brought an application for a finding that the Respondent had abused a child, for the purposes of entering his name in the Child Abuse Register. The complainant described certain incidents that amounted to sexual assault when she was under the age of 16. The Respondent had previously been acquitted of charges based on the same allegations in criminal court. The Respondent has abused a child within the meaning of the Act. Although the standard of proof is on the balance of probabilities, it is elevated with the seriousness of the allegations and their implications. However, it is considerably less than proof beyond a reasonable doubt.","The applicant brought an application to find that the respondent had abused a child pursuant to s. 62(a) or (c) of the Children and Family Services Act. The applicant had known the respondent for some time and had stayed with him when he was seventy-seven years old. The parties had sexual contact in the early years of the relationship, which included fooling around with the dog's penis and playing with it. The respondent was now seventy-eight years old and would have been approximately seventy-two or seventy-three at the time of the alleged sexual contact. There are very serious allegations and the Court will consider this within the standard of proof. The evidence of the complainant's allegation that she was sexually assaulted by the respondent has more probability of truth than disbelief."
4_2000canlii2633.txt,"The parties were married for 14 years and separated in 1995, entering into a detailed Separation Agreement in 1998. The two children of the marriage are 16 and 8 years of age. There was a long history of relatively short terms of employment and several moves to take employment. The respondent had a grade 12 education and some university courses but no practical skills or training. For the past 3 years, the respondent had made no reasonable efforts for employment, developed no skills of a practical nature, and derived her income from child support payments and the Child Tax Credit and by incurring debt in excess of $20,000.00 The parties had entered bankruptcy during the course of the marriage and had no assets or savings or pension entitlement at the time of separation or acquired since. The petitioner now earned an annual salary of $115,500.00. The Agreement did not address the level of child support in accordance with the Federal Child Support Guidelines, nor did it provide for practical retaining by the Respondent to facilitate employment. This was an exceptional situation that required some adjustment to the Agreement reached by the parties. The court ordered the establishment of a retraining fund of $6,500.00 with direct payments to whatever institution the Respondent may choose. Limited spousal support was to terminate on the earlier of completion of the retraining allowance or transfer of the balance of the outstanding to the Respondent on September 1st, 2001. An adjustment was also made to account for arrears in child support and child support payments.","The parties were married for 14 years and had two children, ages 16 and 8. There had been a number of interim applications and interim orders since the separation, but all jurisdictional requirements had been met and a Divorce Judgment would be issued forthwith. The petitioner had taken out plans through employment to provide coverage for the children and had not yet filed his return. The parties had no financial stability throughout their entire 14 year cohabitation or since. The court found that the parties had never had any financial stability in part because they far too readily accessed credit based on future expectations of capacity that have never been realized and they would be wise to cease utilization of credit for short term relief in the long run. Doing so in the short run imperils the ability to provide properly for all the children."
5_1993canlii6695.txt,"The plaintiff applied under Queen's Bench Rule 231 to strike the statements of defence of a corporate and individual defendant for failure to attend scheduled examinations despite service of an appointment and payment of conduct money to their solicitor. The defendants had previously been permitted to re-open judgments obtained against them and had filed defences. Prior to that they had consistently failed to attend examinations in aid of execution. Contempt proceedings had been commenced against them but were adjourned sine die at the time the defendants were permitted to defend. The defendants resisted the application on the basis that they were now non-residents and not compellable by an appointment, and that the designated officer of the defendant corporation was no longer an officer. This information had not been communicated to the plaintiff's solicitor who had acted in good faith on information given to him previously by the solicitors for the defendants. The examinations had been scheduled unilaterally because the defendants' solicitor consistently refused or neglected to return phone calls or correspondence from the plaintiff's solicitors. HELD: The judge refused to strike the defences holding that in the circumstances Queen's Bench Rule 231 did not apply. He also held that the defendants, considering their conduct throughout the whole course of the lawsuit, were in contempt and ordered them to attend without conduct money any examinations unilaterally scheduled by the plaintiff failing agreement between counsel as to dates. Costs were fixed at $1,500 in any event of the cause and were ordered to be paid within two weeks.","The plaintiff applied to strike the statement of defence of the corporate defendant after the plaintiff's solicitors failed to appear at an examination for discovery on the same grounds that the designated officer of the corporation, the designated officers, had failed to show at the initial examination and had to be relocated to British Columbia to attend.

HELD: The applications were dismissed with costs to the plaintiff fixed at $1,000 against the corporate defendants and $500 against the individual defendant. The purpose of the discretionary relief was not to enable the defendants to stall the action or to frustrate the plaintiff’s claim but to facilitate the determination of the plaintiff by his fellow solicitors.

1998canlii3382.txt,"The appellant employer and the respondent union are parties to a collective agreement with effect from January 1, 1994 to December 31, 1996. The collective agreement established employee salaries for that period, with annual adjustments on January 1st of each year. Shortly before the agreement was signed, the Public Sector Compensation Act was passed, which rolled back and froze public sector salaries. In a letter to the union, the employer confirmed the wage increases provided for in the agreement would be paid to the employees as a lump sum following the expiration of the legislated wage freeze. After the expiration of the wage freeze, however, the employer refused to pay the lump sum on the grounds that it would contravene the Act. The union sued the employer in the Supreme Court, claiming the lump sum or, in the alternative, damages for negligent misrepresentation. The employer applied to strike the Statement of Claim on the grounds that the union's claims were within the exclusive jurisdiction of an arbitrator. The Chambers judge dismissed the application. The employer appealed. Allowing the appeal and staying the action pending submission to arbitration as provided for in the collective agreement, that the Chambers judge erred in allowing the action to continue. Where there is a doubt about the arbitrability of a dispute, that issue should generally be determined at arbitration. This reflects the central role of arbitration in collective bargaining labour relations, recognizes that arbitration is the forum best suited to conducting the necessary inquiry, and helps ensure that no one, absent sound reasons, will be left with rights but no effective remedy.",The parties were parties to a collective agreement which governed public sector salaries for the period 1994-96. The agreement was signed by both parties as a result of Bill 52 (the Public Sector Compensation Act) and was given Royal Assent. The employer sued the union for negligent misrepresentation. The union applied to strike the employer's statement of claim on the grounds the employer failed to take the position that the collective agreement was arbitrable. The respondent appealed. Appeal allowed; the court's jurisdiction was limited to the arbitrator's discretion and the dispute resolution mechanism was properly put before the court under Rule 14.25. The court had a duty not to intervene in the resolution of disputes by arbitration but to take full exploration of the circumstances surrounding the creation of the document.
